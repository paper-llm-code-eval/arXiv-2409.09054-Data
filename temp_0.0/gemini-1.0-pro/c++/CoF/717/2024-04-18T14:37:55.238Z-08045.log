Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

---

Să considerăm următorul şir:

`a`$,$ `b`$,$ `ba`$,$ `bab`$,$ `babba`$,$ `babbabab`$, \dots$

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine care este cel de-al $n$-lea termen al şirului

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `sir.in` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul natural $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `sir.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care se află al $n$-lea termen din şir

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 20$;

Example:
`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
bab
```

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```c++

  int n;
  in >> n;

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
4
```
Expected output:
```
bab
```
Found output:
```
bbbaaaa
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.

The issue with the previous solution is that it constructs the string in reverse order. To fix this, the string should be constructed from the end to the beginning.

Here is the fixed solution:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("sir.in");
  ofstream out("sir.out");
  int n;
  in >> n;
  string s = "a";
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    s = "a" + s + "b";
  }
  out << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
