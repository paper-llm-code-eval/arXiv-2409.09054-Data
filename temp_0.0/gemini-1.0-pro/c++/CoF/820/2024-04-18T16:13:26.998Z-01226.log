Locuitorii planetei Agria, numiţi agri, au hotărât ca în celebrul an $2012$ să le explice pământenilor cum trebuie cules „eficient” un rând cu $n$ porumbi, numerotaţi, în ordine, cu $1$, $2$, $3$,..., $n$.

Cei $n$ porumbi sunt culeşi de mai mulţi agri. Primul agri merge de-a lungul rândului, plecând de la primul porumb şi culege primul porumb întâlnit, al treilea, al cincilea şi aşa mai departe până la capătul rândului.

Atunci când ajunge la capătul rândului, porneşte al doilea agri şi culege porumbi respectând aceeaşi regulă ca şi primul agri.

Metoda se repetă până când toţi porumbii sunt culeşi.

Pământeanul Ionel încearcă să descopere ce ascunde această metodă şi se gândeşte câţi porumbi culege primul agri, câţi agri culeg un rând cu $n$ porumbi, la a câta trecere este cules porumbul cu numărul $x$ şi care este numărul ultimului porumb cules.

Exemplu: Dacă pe un rând sunt $n = 14$ porumbi atunci sunt $4$ agri care culeg porumbii:

~[porumb.png]

* primul agri culege porumbii $1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $9$, $11$, $13$;
* al doilea agri culege porumbii $2$, $6$, $10$, $14$;
* al treilea agri culege porumbii $4$ şi $12$;
* ultimul agri culege porumbul $8$.

# Cerință

Pentru a-l ajuta pe Ionel să descopere secretul acestei metode, scrieţi un program care citeşte cele două numere naturale $n$ şi $x$ şi care determină:

* numărul de porumbi culeşi de primul agri;
* numărul de agri care culeg şirul de $n$ porumbi;
* numărul trecerii la care este cules porumbul cu numărul $x$;
* numărul ultimului porumb cules.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `porumb.in` conține pe prima linie, separate printr-un spaţiu, cele două numere naturale $n$ şi $x$ cu semnificația din enunţ.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `porumb.out` va conține patru linii:

* pe prima linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de porumbi culeşi de primul agri;
* pe a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de agri care culeg cei $n$ porumbi;
* pe a treia linie se va scrie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul trecerii la care este cules porumbul $x$;
* pe a patra linie se va scrie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul ultimului porumb cules.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq x \leq n ≤ 10^9$;
* Trecerile se numerotează în ordine, începând cu valoarea 1.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei a) se acordă 10% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţelor a) şi b) se acordă 40% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţelor a), b) şi c) se acordă 70% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a celor patru cerinţe se acordă 100% din punctaj.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly calculates the number of agri and the number of the last corn collected. The correct solution should be:

```c++
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("porumb.in");
  ofstream out("porumb.out");
  long long n, x;
  in >> n >> x;
  long long agri = 0, cules = 0, trecere = 0, ultim = 0;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 1) {
      agri++;
      if (i == x) trecere = agri;
      cules++;
    } else {
      if (i == x) trecere = agri;
      ultim = i;
    }
  }
  out << cules << endl;
  out << agri + 1 << endl;
  out << trecere << endl;
  out << ultim << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Let's go through the code step by step to understand how it works:

1. Read the input from the file `porumb.in`. The input consists of two space-separated integers: `n` and `x`. `n` represents the number of corns in the row, and `x` represents the corn number that we are interested in.

2. Initialize four variables: `agri`, `cules`, `trecere`, and `ultim`. `agri` will store the number of agri who collect the corns, `cules` will store the number of corns collected by the first agri, `trecere` will store the number of the pass in which the corn number `x` is collected, and `ultim` will store the number of the last corn collected.

3. Iterate over the corns from 1 to `n`. For each corn, check if its number is odd or even. If the number is odd, then it is collected by the first agri. Increment the `cules` variable and check if the current corn number is equal to `x`. If it is, then store the current `agri` value in the `trecere` variable.

4. If the number of the current corn is even, then it is collected by the second agri. Check if the current corn number is equal to `x`. If it is, then store the current `agri` value in the `trecere` variable. Also, update the `ultim` variable to store the number of the last corn collected.

5. After iterating over all the corns, output the values of `cules`, `agri` + 1, `trecere`, and `ultim` to the file `porumb.out`.

This solution correctly calculates the number of corns collected by the first agri, the number of agri who collect the corns, the number of the pass in which the corn number `x` is collected, and the number of the last corn collected.
