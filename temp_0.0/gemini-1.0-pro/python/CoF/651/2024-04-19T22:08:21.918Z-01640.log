Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cmmdc.in` and write to `cmmdc.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un șir $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$  de numere naturale nenule.

# Cerință

Să se determine răspunsul pentru una dintre următoarele cerințe:

1. Cel mai mare divizor comun al celor $n$ numere.
2. Cel mai mare divizor comun care se poate obține alegând exact $n - 1$ elemente din șir.
3. Cel mai mare divizor comun care se poate obține alegând exact $n - 2$ elemente din șir.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `cmmdc.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $T$ reprezentând cerința cerută ($1$, $2$ sau $3$), pe a doua linie se află numărul natural nenul $n$, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii se găsesc, câte un numărul pe fiecare linie, cele $n$ elemente ale șirului.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul `cmmdc.out` se va afișa răspunsul pentru cerința cerută.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq a_i \leq 2^{63} - 1$ oricare $1 \leq i \leq n$ (numerele sunt de tip `long long`)

|#|Punctaj|Restricții|
|-|-|--------|
|1|16|$T = 1$, $3 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$ și $a_i \leq 50 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru $1 \leq i \leq n$|
|2|20|$T = 1$ și $3 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$|
|3|21|$T = 2$ și $3 \leq n \leq 3 \ 000$|

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly calculate the GCD for the second and third test cases.
To fix this, we need to modify the code to correctly calculate the GCD for all test cases.
Here is the fixed code:
```python
import sys

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def main():
    with open('cmmdc.in', 'r') as f:
        t = int(f.readline())
        n = int(f.readline())
        a = [int(f.readline()) for _ in range(n)]

    if t == 1:
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans = gcd(ans, a[i])
        with open('cmmdc.out', 'w') as f:

        for i in range(1, n):
            ans = gcd(ans, a[i])
        for i in range(n):
            ans = gcd(ans, gcd(a[0], a[i]))
        with open('cmmdc.out', 'w') as f:
            f.write(str(ans))
    elif t == 3:
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans = gcd(ans, a[i])
