Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `paranteze.in` and write to `paranteze.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

---

Considerăm şiruri formate din paranteze de două tipuri: paranteze rotunde şi paranteze drepte. Parantezele se codifică în felul următor: paranteză rotundă deschisă cu $0$, paranteză rotundă închisă cu $1$, paranteză dreaptă deschisă cu $2$, paranteză dreaptă închisă cu $3$. Spre deosebire de convenţia uzuală din matematică, aici pot exista şi paranteze rotunde incluse în paranteze drepte şi paranteze drepte incluse în paranteze rotunde. Nu putem asocia unei paranteze rotunde deschise o paranteză dreaptă închisă sau viceversa.

# Cerință

Să se decidă dacă un astfel de şir este corect construit, în sensul că putem asocia corect două câte două parantezele de fiecare tip


# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `paranteze.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul $n$ (numărul de şiruri ale testului). 

Apoi pe fiecare din liniile $2, 3, \dots, n+1$ se află numerele $L \ c_1 \ c_2 \ \dots \ c_L$, numărul natural $L$ reprezintă lungimea unui şir de paranteze codificat conform enunţului. 

Valorile $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_L$ reprezintă codurile respective. Toate numerele sunt despărţite prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fişierului de ieșire `paranteze.out` se va scrie $n$ linii. Pe câte o linie va fi scris câte un mesaj. Pe fiecare linie se va scrie unul din mesajele `Da`, respectiv `Nu`, reprezentând rezultatele verificării corectitudinii şirurilor. Ordinea lor corespunde ordinii şirurilor din fişierul de intrare

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10$;
* Fiecare valoare $L$ îndeplineşte condiţia: $1 \leq L \leq 500$.

The error is caused by trying to convert a string that contains multiple words to an integer. To fix this, we need to split the string into words and then convert the first word to an integer. Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('paranteze.in') as f_in, open('paranteze.out', 'w') as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    for _ in range(n):
        l = int(f_in.readline().split()[0])
        s = f_in.readline().split()
        stack = []
        ok = True
        for c in s:
            if c in '02':
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                if not stack or stack.pop() != str(int(c) - 1):
                    ok = False
                    break
        f_out.write('Da\n' if ok else 'Nu\n')

The error is caused by trying to access the first element of an empty list. To fix this, we need to check if the list is empty before accessing the first element. Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('paranteze.in') as f_in, open('paranteze.out', 'w') as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    for _ in range(n):
        l = int(f_in.readline().split()[0]) if f_in.readline().split() else 0
        s = f_in.readline().split()
        stack = []
        ok = True
        for c in s:
            if c in '02':
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                if not stack or stack.pop() != str(int(c) - 1):
                    ok = False
                    break
        f_out.write('Da\n' if ok else 'Nu\n')

The differences between the expected and found results are:

* The expected output for the first line is `Da`, but the found output is `Nu`.
* The expected output for the second line is `Da`, but the found output is `Nu`.
* The expected output for the fourth line is `Nu`, but the found output is `Da`.
* The expected output for the fifth line is `Nu`, but the found output is `Da`.
* The expected output for the sixth line is `Nu`, but the found output is `Da`.

The reason for these differences is that the code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple pairs of parentheses of the same type. For example, in the first line, there are two pairs of parentheses of type `()`. The code does not correctly handle this case and incorrectly determines that the string is not correctly balanced.

Here is a fixed version of the code that correctly handles the case where there are multiple pairs of parentheses of the same type:

```python
with open('paranteze.in') as f_in, open('paranteze.out', 'w') as f_out:

    for _ in range(n):
        l = int(f_in.readline().split()[0]) if f_in.readline().split() else 0
        s = f_in.readline().split()
