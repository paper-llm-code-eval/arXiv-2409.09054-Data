Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `anagrame.in` and write to `anagrame.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un cuvânt format numai din litere mici. Numim anagramă un cuvânt format din literele cuvântului dat, schimbând eventual ordinea literelor. De exemplu o anagramă a cuvântului tamara este cuvântul armata. Evident, un cuvânt poate fi considerat o anagramă a lui însuşi.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să genereze toate anagramele unui cuvânt dat, în ordine lexicografică.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `anagrame.in` conţine pe prima linie cuvântul dat.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `anagrame.out` va conţine în ordine anagramele cuvântului dat, câte una pe linie.

# Restricții și precizări

* Cuvântul dat are cel mult $10$ litere mici.
* Cuvântul $x = x_1 \ x_2 \dots x_n$ precede cuvântul $y = y_1 \ y_2 \dots y_n$ dacă există un indice $k \in {1, 2, \dots, n}$ astfel încât $x_i = y_i$, $i \in {1, 2, \dots, k - 1}$, iar litera $x_k$ precede în alfabet litera $y_k$.

---

Example:
`anagrame.in`
```
ana
```

`anagrame.out`
```
aan
ana
naa
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.

The issue with the previous solution is that it generates duplicate anagrams. This happens because the `permute` function does not keep track of the letters that have already been used in the prefix. As a result, the function can generate the same anagram multiple times, with different prefixes.

To fix this issue, we can use a set to keep track of the letters that have already been used in the prefix. When we generate a new anagram, we can add the first letter of the anagram to the set. If the letter is already in the set, then we know that we have already generated this anagram, and we can skip it.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as f:
    word = f.readline().strip()

anagrams = []

def permute(word, prefix):
    if len(word) == 0:
        anagrams.append(prefix)
    else:
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if word[i] not in prefix:
                permute(word[:i] + word[i+1:], prefix + word[i])

permute(word, '')

with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as f:
    for anagram in sorted(anagrams):
        f.write(anagram + '\n')

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not generate any anagrams at all. This is because the `permute` function checks if the first letter of the anagram is already in the prefix. However, the prefix is initially empty, so the condition is always false.

To fix this issue, we can simply remove the check for the first letter of the anagram.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as f:
    word = f.readline().strip()

anagrams = []

def permute(word, prefix):
    if len(word) == 0:
        anagrams.append(prefix)
    else:
        for i in range(len(word)):
            permute(word[:i] + word[i+1:], prefix + word[i])

permute(word, '')

with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as f:
