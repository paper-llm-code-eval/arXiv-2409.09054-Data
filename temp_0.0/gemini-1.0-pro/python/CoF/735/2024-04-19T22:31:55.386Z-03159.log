Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `numere.in` and write to `numere.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Mircea este pasionat de programare. El a început să rezolve probleme din ce în ce mai grele. Astfel a ajuns la o problemă, care are ca date de intrare un tablou pătratic cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane, componente tabloului fiind toate numerele naturale distincte de la $1$ la $n^2$. Pentru a verifica programul pe care l-a scris îi trebuie un fişier care să conţină tabloul respectiv. După ce a creat acest fişier, fratele său, pus pe şotii îi umblă în fişier şi îi schimbă câteva numere consecutive, cu numărul $0$. Când se întoarce Mircea de la joacă constată cu stupoare că nu îi merge programul pentru testul respectiv. După câteva ore de depanare îşi dă seama că programul lui este corect şi că fişierul de intrare are probleme.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să-l ajute pe Mircea, găsindu-i cel mai mic şi cel mai mare dintre numerele consecutive schimbate de fratele său.

# Date de intrare
În fişierul `numere.in` se dă pe prima linie $n$, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii elementele tabloului, câte $n$ elemente pe o linie, separate între ele prin câte un spaţiu, după modificările făcute de fratele lui Mircea.

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `numere.out` se va scrie pe un singur rând cu un singur spaţiu între ele numerele cerute (primul fiind cel mai mic).

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $0 < n \leq 500$
- Fratele lui Mircea schimbă cel puţin un număr în fişier.
- Numerele schimbate de fratele lui Mircea sunt mai mici sau cel mult egale cu $60\ 000$.

Example:
`numere.in`
```
3
5 0 7
0 0 1
6 9 8
```

`numere.out`
```
2 4
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the fact that the numbers in the matrix are consecutive.
Here is a fixed version of the code:
