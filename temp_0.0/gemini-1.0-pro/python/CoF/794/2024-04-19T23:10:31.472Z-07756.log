Se dă un număr raţional strict pozitiv $q$, sub formă de fracţie zecimală.

# Cerință

Să se determine două numere naturale $a$ şi $b$ astfel încât $q = a / b$, iar modulul diferenţei dintre $a$ şi $b$ să fie minim.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul `numar.in` conţine:

* pe prima linie două valori naturale $ni$ şi $nz$. $ni$ reprezintă numărul de cifre care formeaza partea întreagă a lui $q$ iar $nz$ reprezintă numărul de cifre care formează partea fracţionara a lui $q$.
* pe a doua linie, $ni$ cifre care reprezintă partea întreagă a lui $q$. Între două cifre se află câte un caracter spaţiu.
* pe a treia linie, $nz$ cifre care reprezintă partea zecimală a lui $q$. Între două cifre se află câte un caracter spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `numar.out` va conţine:

* pe prima linie un număr natural $n_1$ care reprezintă numărul de cifre din care este alcătuit numărul $a$;
* pe a doua linie, cifrele numărului $a$, fără spaţiu între ele.
* pe a treia linie un număr natural $n_2$ care reprezintă numărul de cifre din care este alcătuit numărul $b$;
* pe a patra linie, cifrele numarului $b$, fără spaţiu între ele.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq ni, nz < 2 \ 000$.
* $1 \leq ni + nz \leq 2 \ 000$.
* Cifrele din care este alcătuit $q$ sunt cele din sistemul zecimal.
* Pentru $20$% dintre teste, $ni + nz \leq 9$; pentru alte $15$% dintre teste, $10 \leq ni + nz \leq 16$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open('numar.in') as f:
    ni, nz = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b *= 10 ** nz
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    while b % a != 0:
        b += 10 ** nz
    with open('numar.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f'{len(str(a))}\n{a}\n{len(str(b))}\n{b}')

Program exited with code 1.

stderr:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 8, in <module>
    while b % a != 0:

ZeroDivisionError: integer modulo by zero

```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The program exited with code 1 because of a `ZeroDivisionError`. This error is raised when trying to divide a number by zero. In this case, the error is raised because the program is trying to calculate the remainder of `b` divided by `a` using the modulo operator (`%`). However, `a` is initially set to the integer value of the input string, which is 0. Dividing by zero is not allowed in mathematics, so the program crashes.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that `a` is not 0 before trying to calculate the remainder. We can do this by checking if `a` is equal to 0 before performing the modulo operation. If `a` is 0, we can simply skip the modulo operation and continue with the rest of the program.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('numar.in') as f:
    ni, nz = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b *= 10 ** nz
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    while a != 0 and b % a != 0:
        b += 10 ** nz
    with open('numar.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f'{len(str(a))}\n{a}\n{len(str(b))}\n{b}')
```

The expected output is:

```
1
3
1
8
```

The found output is:

```
1
0
6
375000
```

The differences between the expected and found output are:

* The found output has a leading 0 in the number `a`.
* The found output has 6 digits in the number `b`, while the expected output has only 1 digit.
* The found output has the number `375000` in `b`, while the expected output has the number `8`.

The reason for these differences is that the program is not correctly calculating the value of `b`. In the fixed code, I changed the line:

```python
b += 10 ** nz
```

to:

```python
b += a
```

This ensures that `b` is always a multiple of `a`, and that the difference between `a` and `b` is minimized.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('numar.in') as f:
    ni, nz = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b *= 10 ** nz
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    while a != 0 and b % a != 0:
        b += a
    with open('numar.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f'{len(str(a))}\n{a}\n{len(str(b))}\n{b}')
