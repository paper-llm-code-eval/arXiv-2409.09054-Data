Gigel, elev în clasa a VII-a, pasionat de aplicațiile informatice, s-a gândit să-și facă un program care să simuleze cunoscutul produs Excel. Zis și făcut, s-a pus pe treabă și într-o oră a reușit să realizeze un program asemănător Excel-ului, dar care, spre deosebire de original, nu poate face decât o singură operație în celulele sale: suma. Încercați și dumneavoastră să realizați isprava lui Gigel!
Reamintim că o foaie de calcul în Excel se prezintă sub forma unei suprafețe liniate cu linii orizontale și verticale. Prin intersecția lor rezultă dreptunghiuri (numite celule), fiecare celulă având un nume format dintr-o literă și un număr, reprezentând coloana, respectiv linia pe care se află.

~[excel.png|align=center|width=45em]

De exemplu, celula din stânga sus este $A1$, urmată, pe linie, de $B1, C1$, etc. Introducerea unei formule într-o celulă începe întotdeauna cu semnul `=`. De exemplu dacă în celula `C2` scriem `=A2+B2` înseamnă că în această celulă se va scrie rezultatul adunării valorilor din celulele $A2$ și $B2$. Pot exista și celule cu formula `=A5` ceea ce înseamnă că în celula respectivă vom avea un rezultat egal cu cel din celula $A5$. Fiind abia la început și în ceea ce privește programarea și în ceea ce privește aplicația Excel, Gigel se gândește ca programul său să completeze celulele începând cu prima coloană, apoi a doua etc., astfel că formulele care pot apărea în celula ($col$, $lin$) pot folosi datele din coloanele $1$ până la $col-1$ și din celulele aflate pe liniile $1$ până la $lin-1$ din coloana $col$.

# Cerință

Dându-se o foaie de calcul să se înlocuiască toate formulele care apar, prin rezultatele obținute respectând cerințele date în text.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `excel.in` are pe prima linie două valori $m \ n$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând numărul de coloane, respectiv de linii ale foii de calcul. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se descriu cele $m$ coloane ale foii. O descriere poate fi formată din valori întregi pozitive sau formule separate printr-un singur spațiu. Formulele sunt șiruri de caractere care încep întotdeauna cu semnul `=`. Fișierul de intrare se consideră corect, în sensul că operațiile care apar se pot executa, iar foaia de calcul se poate completa.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `excel.out` va conține $n$ linii, pe fiecare linie câte $m$ valori reprezentând rezultatul final al operațiilor realizate în foaia de calcul.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0$ < numărul de coloane $\leq 26$, notate de la `A` la `Z`;
* $0$ < numărul de linii $\leq 50$;
* fiecare linie ce descrie foaia Excel are o lungime maximă $< 256$;
* fiecare valoare numerică din foaia de calcul inițială este un număr pozitiv $\leq 100$;
* formulele care pot să apară în celule se referă doar la operația de adunare.

`excel.in`

11 21 =A1+A2 =A3
10 15 =B1+B2 =A2+B1

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle cells that reference other cells that contain formulas. For example, in the input data, cell `C1` contains the formula `=A1+A2`. When the program tries to evaluate this formula, it sees that cell `A1` contains the formula `=A1+A2`. This creates a circular reference, which the program cannot handle.

To fix this issue, we can use a recursive function to evaluate formulas. The function will take a cell as input and return the value of that cell. If the cell contains a formula, the function will recursively call itself to evaluate the formula.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
def evaluate_cell(sheet, i, j):
    if sheet[j][i].isdigit():
        return int(sheet[j][i])
    else:
        formula = sheet[j][i][1:]
        return sum(evaluate_cell(sheet, k, l) for k in range(j) for l in range(i) if formula[1:] in sheet[k][l])

with open('excel.in') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    sheet = [list(map(str, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        if sheet[j][i][0] == '=':
            sheet[j][i] = str(evaluate_cell(sheet, i, j))

with open('excel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in sheet:
        f.write(' '.join(row) + '\n')

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle circular references. For example, in the input data, cell `C1` contains the formula `=A1+A2`. When the program tries to evaluate this formula, it sees that cell `A1` contains the formula `=A1+A2`. This creates a circular reference, which the program cannot handle.

To fix this issue, we can use a topological sort to order the cells in the spreadsheet. A topological sort is an ordering of the cells such that, for any two cells `A` and `B`, if `A` contains a formula that references `B`, then `A` comes after `B` in the ordering.

Once we have a topological sort of the cells, we can evaluate the formulas in the correct order.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def topological_sort(sheet):
    # Create a directed graph of the cells.
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(len(sheet)):
        for j in range(len(sheet[i])):
            if sheet[j][i][0] == '=':
                formula = sheet[j][i][1:]
                for cell in formula[1:].split('+'):
                    graph[cell].append((i, j))

    # Perform a topological sort of the graph.
    visited = set()
    stack = []
    def dfs(cell):
        if cell in visited:
            return
        visited.add(cell)
        for neighbor in graph[cell]:
            dfs(neighbor)
        stack.append(cell)
    for cell in graph:
        dfs(cell)

    # Return the topological order of the cells.
    return stack

def evaluate_cell(sheet, i, j):
    if sheet[j][i].isdigit():
        return int(sheet[j][i])
    else:
        formula = sheet[j][i][1:]
        return sum(evaluate_cell(sheet, k, l) for k in range(j) for l in range(i) if formula[1:] in sheet[k][l])

with open('excel.in') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    sheet = [list(map(str, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Perform a topological sort of the cells.
topological_order = topological_sort(sheet)

# Evaluate the formulas in the correct order.
for cell in topological_order:
    i, j = cell
    if sheet[j][i][0] == '=':
        sheet[j][i] = str(evaluate_cell(sheet, i, j))

with open('excel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in sheet:

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle cells that are not referenced by any other cells. These cells are not included in the directed graph that is created by the `topological_sort` function, which causes the function to raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access these cells.

To fix this issue, we can add a dummy cell to the directed graph that references all of the cells that are not referenced by any other cells. This will ensure that all of the cells are included in the topological sort.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

    # Create a directed graph of the cells.
    graph = defaultdict(list)

        for j in range(len(sheet[i])):

                formula = sheet[j][i][1:]
                for cell in formula[1:].split('+'):
                    graph[cell].append((i, j))

    # Add a dummy cell to the graph that references all of the cells that are not referenced by any other cells.
    dummy_cell = len(sheet)
    for i in range(len(sheet)):
        for j in range(len(sheet[i])):
            if sheet[j][i][0] != '=' and (i, j) not in graph:
                graph[dummy_cell].append((i, j))

    # Perform a topological sort of the graph.
    visited = set()
    stack = []
    def dfs(cell):
