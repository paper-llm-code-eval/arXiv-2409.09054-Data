Dorel și-a achiziționat o fermă cu $n$ plantații și o mașină de transport cu o capacitate $c$, pentru transportul de îngrășăminte la toate plantațiile. Îngrășămintele se află într-un depozit, în cantitate suficientă pentru scopul propus. Plantațiile și depozitul sunt dispuse sub forma unui cerc. Există drumuri doar între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$ ($1 \leq i \leq n-1$), precum și între depozit și plantația $1$ și depozit și plantația $n$, ca în figură. La o plantație $i$ se poate ajunge de la depozit trecând prin plantațiile $1, 2, \dots, i-1$ sau prin plantațiile $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$, alegerea făcându-se în funcție de traseul cel mai scurt. Se cunosc aceste distanțe, precum și cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru fiecare plantație. La fiecare încărcare, Dorel ia din depozit exact cantitatea $c$. 

Dorel vrea să-și organizeze bine munca la fermă și să consume cât mai puțină benzină prin **alegerea celor mai scurte trasee de parcurs**. Plantațiile trebuie să fie aprovizionate **obligatoriu** în ordinea următoare: mai întâi plantația $1$, apoi plantația $2$, plantația $3$, $\dots$, plantația $n$. În plus, și-a propus să încarce o nouă cantitate de îngrășământ doar după ce a folosit toată cantitatea încărcată anterior. Transportarea îngrășămintelor pe plantații se face deci, începând cu plantația $1$. După ce se transportă toată cantitatea necesară pentru această plantație, se trece la plantația $2$, și tot așa în ordine la $3, 4$ etc. până se deservește ultima plantație. Dacă după ce s-au transportat îngrășămintele necesare pentru plantația $i$ în mașină au mai rămas încă îngrășăminte, acestea trebuie utilizate în continuare pentru alte plantații, alese în ordinea impusă (începând cu plantația $i+1$, apoi $i+2$ etc.), până se epuizează toată cantitatea transportată de mașină. Astfel, dacă de la plantația $i$ trebuie să ajungă la plantația $i+1$, va alege cel mai scurt traseu dintre traseul direct de la plantația $i$ la $i+1$ și traseul care trece prin plantațiile $i-1$, $i-2$, $\dots$, $1$, depozit, $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$. La final, mașina trebuie să se întoarcă la depozit, goală sau cu cantitatea rămasă după aprovizionarea cu îngrășăminte a plantației $n$.


# Cerință

Ajutați-l pe Dorel să calculeze distanța parcursă pentru a transporta îngrășăminte la toate cele $n$ plantații, conform cerințelor.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `fermier.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $n$ și $c$, separate printr-un spațiu. A doua linie conține numerele naturale $d_0, d_1, d_2, \dots, d_{n-1}, d_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, unde $d_0$ este distanța dintre prima plantație și depozit, $d_i$ este distanța între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$, iar $d_n$ este distanța dintre plantația $n$ și depozit. Pe linia a treia se găsesc numerele naturale $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n-1}, q_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, $q_i$ reprezentând cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru plantația $i$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `fermier.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $1 \leq n \leq 2$, pentru teste în valoare de $20$ de puncte;
* $1 \leq d_i, c, q_i \leq 1 \ 000$;

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the case when the remaining capacity of the truck is greater than the amount of fertilizer needed for the next plantation. In this case, the truck should go to the next plantation without returning to the warehouse.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('fermier.in') as fin, open('fermier.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, c = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    d = [0] + list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    q = [0] + list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    dist = 0
    pos = 1
    while pos <= n:
        dist += d[pos]
        if q[pos] <= c:
            c -= q[pos]
            pos += 1
        else:
            dist += min(d[pos] + d[0], d[pos] + d[pos+1])
            c = q[pos] - c
            pos += 1
    fout.write(str(dist))
```

Let's go through the fixed solution step by step:

1. Read the input data from the file `fermier.in`.
2. Initialize the distance traveled to 0 and the current position to 1.
3. While the current position is less than or equal to n, do the following:
    - Add the distance to the current position to the total distance traveled.
    - If the amount of fertilizer needed for the current position is less than or equal to the remaining capacity of the truck, then subtract the amount of fertilizer needed from the remaining capacity and move to the next position.
    - Otherwise, calculate the minimum distance to the next position (either by going directly or by going through the warehouse) and add it to the total distance traveled. Then, set the remaining capacity to the amount of fertilizer needed for the current position minus the remaining capacity and move to the next position.
4. Write the total distance traveled to the file `fermier.out`.

This solution takes into account the case when the remaining capacity of the truck is greater than the amount of fertilizer needed for the next plantation, and it correctly calculates the minimum distance to the next plantation in this case.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the truck has some remaining capacity after servicing the last plantation. In this case, the truck should return to the warehouse without visiting any other plantations.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('fermier.in') as fin, open('fermier.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, c = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    d = [0] + list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    q = [0] + list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    dist = 0
    pos = 1
    while pos <= n:
        dist += d[pos]
        if q[pos] <= c:
            c -= q[pos]
            pos += 1
        else:
            dist += min(d[pos] + d[0], d[pos] + d[pos+1])
            c = q[pos] - c
            pos += 1
    if c > 0:
        dist += d[0]
    fout.write(str(dist))
```

Let's go through the fixed solution step by step:

1. Read the input data from the file `fermier.in`.
2. Initialize the distance traveled to 0 and the current position to 1.
3. While the current position is less than or equal to n, do the following:
    - Add the distance to the current position to the total distance traveled.
    - If the amount of fertilizer needed for the current position is less than or equal to the remaining capacity of the truck, then subtract the amount of fertilizer needed from the remaining capacity and move to the next position.
    - Otherwise, calculate the minimum distance to the next position (either by going directly or by going through the warehouse) and add it to the total distance traveled. Then, set the remaining capacity to the amount of fertilizer needed for the current position minus the remaining capacity and move to the next position.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the truck has to go through the warehouse to reach the next plantation. In this case, the distance to the next plantation should be calculated as the sum of the distance from the current position to the warehouse and the distance from the warehouse to the next plantation.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('fermier.in') as fin, open('fermier.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, c = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    d = [0] + list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

            pos += 1
    if c > 0:
        dist += d[0]
    fout.write(str(dist))
```

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the truck has enough capacity to reach the next plantation directly, but the distance to the next plantation through the warehouse is shorter. In this case, the truck should go to the next plantation through the warehouse.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('fermier.in') as fin, open('fermier.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, c = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    d = [0] + list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    q = [0] + list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    dist = 0
    pos = 1
    while pos <= n:
        dist += d[pos]
        if q[pos] <= c and d[pos] + d[0] >= d[pos] + d[pos+1]:
            c -= q[pos]
            pos += 1
        else:
            dist += min(d[pos] + d[0], d[pos] + d[pos+1])
            if c > 0 and d[pos] + d[0] < d[pos] + d[pos+1]:
                dist += d[pos] + d[0] - c
            c = q[pos] - c
            pos += 1
    if c > 0:
        dist += d[0]
    fout.write(str(dist))
```

Let's go through the fixed solution step by step:

1. Read the input data from the file `fermier.in`.
2. Initialize the distance traveled to 0 and the current position to 1.
3. While the current position is less than or equal to n, do the following:
    - Add the distance to the current position to the total distance traveled.
    - If the amount of fertilizer needed for the current position is less than or equal to the remaining capacity of the truck and the distance to the next plantation through the warehouse is greater than or equal to the distance to the next plantation directly, then subtract the amount of fertilizer needed from the remaining capacity and move to the next position.
    - Otherwise, calculate the minimum distance to the next position (either by going directly or by going through the warehouse) and add it to the total distance traveled.
    - If the remaining capacity of the truck is greater than 0 and the distance to the next plantation through the warehouse is shorter than the distance to the next plantation directly, then calculate the distance to the next plantation through the warehouse and subtract the remaining capacity from it. Add this distance to the total distance traveled.
    - Set the remaining capacity to the amount of fertilizer needed for the current position minus the remaining capacity and move to the next position.
4. If the remaining capacity of the truck is greater than 0, then add the distance from the current position to the warehouse to the total distance traveled.
5. Write the total distance traveled to the file `fermier.out`.

This solution correctly handles the case when the truck has enough capacity to reach the next plantation directly, but the distance to the next plantation through the warehouse is shorter. It calculates the minimum distance to the next plantation in this case.
