Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `control.in` and write to `control.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Gigel a primit spre păstrare un set de $n$ cutii de greutăți nu neapărat distincte. El a cântărit cutiile și pentru fiecare greutate distinctă a notat pe o foaie, în ordine crescătoare a greutăților, numărul de cutii cu greutatea respectivă.

Deoarece fratele său mai mic avea prostul obicei să se joace cu numerele scrise de el pe foaie, Gigel s-a gândit să calculeze un „număr de control” după următorul algoritm: începând de la primul număr a grupat numerele de apariții ale greutăților câte trei (dacă îi rămân numere negrupate la sfârșit, le ignoră). Dacă într-un grup sunt numai numere pare sau numai impare notează grupul cu cifra $1$, altfel îl notează cu cifra $0$. Din șirul astfel obținut, se formează un număr care are ca valoare cifra zecilor egală cu numărul de valori $1$ și cifra unităților egală cu numărul de valori $0$, obținându-se astfel „numărul de control”.

# Cerință

Citind greutățile cutiilor, să se determine „numărul de control” și să se verifice dacă este număr prim.

# Date de intrare

De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `control.in` se citește numărul $n$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural reprezentând greutățile celor n cutii.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `control.out` se va scrie pe prima linie „numărul de control”, urmat, pe linia a doua, de valoarea $0$ sau $1$. Pe linia a doua se va afișa $1$ dacă numărul este prim, respectiv $0$ în caz contrar.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* Fiecare greutate este un număr natural, mai mic sau egal cu $200$

The error is caused by trying to access `counts[i+2]` when `i` is equal to `len(counts) - 1` or `len(counts) - 2`. To fix this, we can add a check to make sure that `i+2` is less than `len(counts)` before accessing `counts[i+2]`.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

with open('control.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    weights = [int(line) for line in f]

weights.sort()
counts = []
current_weight = weights[0]
current_count = 0
for weight in weights:
    if weight == current_weight:
        current_count += 1
    else:
        counts.append(current_count)
        current_weight = weight
        current_count = 1
counts.append(current_count)

control_number = 0
for i in range(0, len(counts), 3):
    if i+2 < len(counts) and counts[i] % 2 == counts[i+1] % 2 == counts[i+2] % 2:
        control_number += 1

is_prime = True
if control_number > 1:
    for i in range(2, int(control_number**0.5) + 1):
        if control_number % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break

with open('control.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(control_number) + '\n')
    f.write(str(int(is_prime)))

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result is `3` instead of `31`. This is because the code is incorrectly counting the number of groups of three consecutive numbers that are all even or all odd.

Specifically, the line `if i+2 < len(counts) and counts[i] % 2 == counts[i+1] % 2 == counts[i+2] % 2:` should be changed to `if i+2 < len(counts) and counts[i] % 2 == counts[i+1] % 2 and counts[i+1] % 2 == counts[i+2] % 2:`.
