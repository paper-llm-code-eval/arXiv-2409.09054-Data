După ce a primit de la Simonet, profesorul său de studii sociale, tema pentru proiect, tânărului Trevor i-a venit ideea jocului ”Pay it forward”. Pentru cei care nu știu acest joc, el constă în ajutarea de către Trevor a oamenilor aflați la ananghie. Aceștia la rândul lor vor ajuta alți oameni și așa mai departe.

Fiecare participant (inclusiv Trevor) trebuie să realizeze câte $k$ fapte bune prin care să ajute oamenii. Vârstnicii și tinerii își îndeplinesc în mod diferit această sarcină. Vârstnicii au nevoie de $\text{zv}$ zile pentru a introduce în joc o altă persoană, iar tinerii au nevoie de $\text{zt}$ zile. Astfel dacă un vârstnic, respectiv un tânăr, intră în joc în ziua $i$, el va introduce la rândul lui în joc prima persoană în ziua $i+\text{zv}$, respectiv în ziua $i+\text{zt}$ tânărul, a doua persoană în ziua $i+2*\text{zv}$, respectiv în ziua $i+2*\text{zt}$ tânărul și așa mai departe. Astfel numărul de persoane care participă la joc poate fi diferit în funcție de cum sunt alese persoanele vârstnice și cele tinere. Trevor dorește ca în joc să fie realizate în total cât mai multe fapte bune, dar fiecare participant să aducă în joc maximum $(k+1)/2$ tineri și maximum $(k+1)/2$ vârstnici. Participanții pot aduce mai puține persoane de un anumit tip, dar nu au voie să depășească numărul de $(k+1)/2$ persoane de același tip.

# Cerință

Care este numărul $\text{fb}$ de fapte bune care mai sunt de realizat, după trecerea a $n$ zile, de către persoanele intrate deja în joc, astfel încât numărul total de fapte bune așteptate (și cele realizate și cele nerealizate) să fie maxim?

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `pif.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $n$, pe a doua linie numărul $k$ și pe a treia linie numerele $\text{zv}$ și $\text{zt}$ separate printr-un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `pif.out` se va scrie restul împărțirii lui $\text{fb}$, cu semnificația din enunț, la $1234567$ ($\text{fb} % 1234567$).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$;
* $1 \leq k, \text{zt}, \text{zv} \leq n$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $30$ de puncte $\text{fb} \leq 10^6$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $30$ de puncte $\text{zv} = \text{zt} = 1$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $20$ de puncte $\text{zv} = \text{zt} \neq 1$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $70$ de puncte $k \cdot n \leq 10^6$;

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the fact that a person can't introduce more than $(k+1)/2$ people of the same type.
Here is a fixed version of the code:

```python
with open('pif.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    k = int(f.readline())
    zv, zt = map(int, f.readline().split())

fb = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % zv == 0:
        fb += min(k // 2, (n - i) // zv)
    if i % zt == 0:
        fb += min((k + 1) // 2, (n - i) // zt)

fb %= 1234567
with open('pif.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(fb))
```

Let's go through the code step by step to understand how it works:

1. Read the input data from the file `pif.in`.
2. Initialize the variable `fb` to 0. This variable will store the number of good deeds that are yet to be done.
3. Iterate over the days from 1 to `n`.
4. For each day `i`, check if it is a multiple of `zv`. If it is, then a senior person enters the game on day `i`. Calculate the number of good deeds that this senior person can do in the remaining days, which is `min(k // 2, (n - i) // zv)`. Add this value to `fb`.
5. Similarly, check if `i` is a multiple of `zt`. If it is, then a young person enters the game on day `i`. Calculate the number of good deeds that this young person can do in the remaining days, which is `min((k + 1) // 2, (n - i) // zt)`. Add this value to `fb`.
6. Finally, write the value of `fb` to the file `pif.out`.

This code takes into account the fact that a person can't introduce more than $(k+1)/2$ people of the same type, and it calculates the number of good deeds that are yet to be done accordingly.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the fact that a person can introduce more than one person of the same type on the same day, and that the number of people that a person can introduce is limited by the value of `k`.
Here is a fixed version of the code:

```python
with open('pif.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    k = int(f.readline())
    zv, zt = map(int, f.readline().split())

fb = 0

    if i % zv == 0:
        fb += min(k // 2, (n - i + zv - 1) // zv)
    if i % zt == 0:
        fb += min((k + 1) // 2, (n - i + zt - 1) // zt)
    fb = min(fb, k * (n - i + 1))

6. Finally, calculate the minimum between `fb` and `k * (n - i + 1)`. This is because the number of good deeds that are yet to be done cannot be greater than the total number of good deeds that can be done by all the people who have entered the game so far.
7. Write the value of `fb` to the file `pif.out`.

This code takes into account all the constraints of the problem, and it calculates the number of good deeds that are yet to be done accordingly.
