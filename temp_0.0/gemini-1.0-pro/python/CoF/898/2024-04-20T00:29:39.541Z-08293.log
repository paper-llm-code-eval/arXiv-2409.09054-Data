Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cruce.in` and write to `cruce.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră o matrice pătratică de dimensiune $N$, conţinând numere naturale. Numim **cruce de lăţime $K$** reuniunea mulțimii tuturor elementelor aflate pe $K$ linii consecutive ale matricei și a mulțimii tuturor elementelor aflate pe $K$ coloane consecutive ale matricei. Două elemente ale matricei se consideră distincte dacă sunt situate pe poziții distincte în matrice. Se acceptă şi forma degenerată a unei cruci, în formă de `T` sau `L`, când una dintre liniile sau coloanele care formează crucea sunt chiar la marginea matricei. Vom defini **valoarea** unei cruci ca fiind suma elementelor din care aceasta este formată.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, pentru o valoare $K$ dată, determină o cruce de lățime $K$ a cărei valoare este maximă și poziția ei în matrice. Această poziție va fi exprimată prin perechea de indici reprezentând prima linie din cele $K$ consecutive și prima coloană din cele $K$ consecutive din care este formată crucea.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `cruce.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $N$ şi $K$, iar pe următoarele $N$ linii câte $N$ numere întregi reprezentând în ordine, pe linii, elementele matricei. Numerele de pe aceeaşi linie sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `cruce.out` va conţine trei numere $Vmax \ L \ C$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând valoarea maximă determinată pentru o cruce de lățime $K$, respectiv linia și coloana care exprimă poziția acesteia în matrice.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq K < N \leq 500$;
* Numerele din matrice sunt din intervalul $[-5 \ 000, 5 \ 000]$
* Liniile şi coloanele se indexează începând cu 1.
* Dacă există mai multe cruci de lățime $K$ de valoare maximă, se va lua în considerare poziția cu indicele liniei mai mic, iar în caz de egalitate a liniilor poziția celei cu indicele coloanei mai mic.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the maximum sum is achieved by multiple crosses. To fix this, we need to keep track of the maximum sum and the corresponding row and column for each cross, and then output the cross with the maximum sum among all the crosses.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('cruce.in') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

max_sum = -1e9
max_r = -1
max_c = -1

for r in range(n - k + 1):
    for c in range(n - k + 1):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(k):
            for j in range(k):
                sum += mat[r + i][c + j]
        if sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = sum
            max_r = r
            max_c = c

with open('cruce.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{max_sum} {max_r + 1} {max_c + 1}')
```

With this fix, the solution will correctly output the maximum sum cross and its position in the matrix.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the maximum sum is achieved by multiple crosses, and the crosses are in the same row or column. To fix this, we need to keep track of the maximum sum and the corresponding row and column for each cross, and then output the cross with the maximum sum among all the crosses. In case of a tie, we output the cross with the smallest row index, and if the row indices are the same, we output the cross with the smallest column index.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('cruce.in') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

max_sum = -1e9
