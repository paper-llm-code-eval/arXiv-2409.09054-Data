Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

The error is caused by the fact that the first line of the input file contains only one integer, the number of cabins, but the code expects two integers, the number of cabins and the number of customers. To fix this, we can simply add a second readline() call to read the number of customers.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
with open('roata.in') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    p = int(f.readline())
    c = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

# Calculate total revenue
revenue = sum(c)

# Create a queue to simulate the rotation of the wheel
queue = [0] * n

# Create a list to store the order in which customers leave the wheel
order = []

# Create a variable to store the number of the cabin from which the last customer will leave
last_cabin = 0

# Simulate the rotation of the wheel
for i in range(revenue):
    # Decrement the number of rotations remaining for the customer in the current cabin
    queue[i % n] -= 1

    # If the customer in the current cabin has finished their rotations, remove them from the queue and add their order number to the list
    if queue[i % n] == 0:
        order.append(c.index(queue[i % n]) + 1)
        queue[i % n] = -1

    # If the next cabin is empty, move the next customer into it
    if queue[(i + 1) % n] == 0:
        queue[(i + 1) % n] = c[order[-1] - 1]

    # Update the number of the cabin from which the last customer will leave
    last_cabin = (i + 1) % n

# Write the output to the file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(revenue) + '\n')
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, order)) + '\n')
    f.write(str(last_cabin + 1))

The error is caused by the fact that the list `order` is empty at the beginning of the program, so `order[-1]` is out of range. To fix this, we can simply add a check to make sure that `order` is not empty before accessing `order[-1]`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
with open('roata.in') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    p = int(f.readline())
    c = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

# Calculate total revenue
revenue = sum(c)

# Create a queue to simulate the rotation of the wheel
queue = [0] * n

# Create a list to store the order in which customers leave the wheel
order = []

# Create a variable to store the number of the cabin from which the last customer will leave
last_cabin = 0

# Simulate the rotation of the wheel
for i in range(revenue):
    # Decrement the number of rotations remaining for the customer in the current cabin
    queue[i % n] -= 1

    # If the customer in the current cabin has finished their rotations, remove them from the queue and add their order number to the list
    if queue[i % n] == 0:
        order.append(c.index(queue[i % n]) + 1)
        queue[i % n] = -1

    # If the next cabin is empty and there are still customers waiting, move the next customer into it
    if queue[(i + 1) % n] == 0 and order:
        queue[(i + 1) % n] = c[order[-1] - 1]

    # Update the number of the cabin from which the last customer will leave
    last_cabin = (i + 1) % n

# Write the output to the file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(revenue) + '\n')
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, order)) + '\n')

The difference between the expected and found output is that the found output is missing the order in which the customers leave the wheel. This is because the code is not correctly adding the order numbers to the `order` list.
