NASA plănuiește o nouă misiune Rover pe Marte în anul 2020. Principalul obiectiv al acestei misiuni este de a determina, cu ajutorul unui nou Rover, dacă a existat în trecut viață pe Marte. Până când va fi lansată misiunea, Roverul este supus la tot felul de teste în laboratoarele NASA. Într-unul din teste, Roverul trebuie să parcurgă o suprafață de forma unui caroiaj cu $N$ linii și $N$ coloane. Acesta pornește din zona de coordonate $(1,1)$ și trebuie să ajungă în zona de coordonate $(N,N)$, la fiecare pas putându-se deplasa din zona în care se află într-una din zonele învecinate la nord, sud, est sau vest. Pentru fiecare zonă de coordonate $(i,j)$ se cunoaște $A_{ij}$, stabilitatea terenului din acea zonă. Știind că Roverul are o greutate $G$, o zonă cu stabilitatea terenului cel puțin egală cu $G$ se consideră o zonă sigură pentru deplasarea Roverului, iar o zonă cu stabilitatea terenului mai mică decât $G$ se consideră o zonă periculoasă pentru Rover.

# Cerințe

1. Determinați numărul minim posibil de zone periculoase pe care le traversează Roverul pentru a ajunge din zona $(1,1)$ în zona $(N,N)$.
2. Determinați greutatea maximă pe care o poate avea un Rover care să ajungă din zona $(1,1)$ în zona $(N,N)$, fără a traversa nicio zonă periculoasă pentru el.

# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `rover.in`  se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$. Dacă $V$ este $1$, pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsesc două numere naturale $N$ și $G$ cu semnificația din enunț, iar dacă $V$ este $2$, pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se află doar numărul $N$.
Pe următoarele $N$ linii se află câte $N$ numere $A_{i,j}$, reprezentând stabilitatea terenului din zona $(i,j)$. 

# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire este `rover.out`.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$, atunci fișierul de ieșire va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul minim de zone periculoase pe care trebuie să le traverseze Roverul de greutate $G$.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând greutatea maximă a unui Rover care poate ajunge din zona $(1,1)$ în zona $(N,N)$ fără a traversa zone periculoase pentru el.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 500$
* $1 \leq G \leq 5 \ 000$
* $1 \leq A_{ij} \leq 10 \ 000$
* Zonele de coordonate $(1,1)$ și $(N,N)$ nu sunt zone periculoase pentru Rover.
* Roverul nu va trece de mai multe ori prin aceeași zonă.

The issue with the previous solution is that it uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, but it does not take into account the weight of the rover. As a result, the solution finds the shortest path regardless of whether or not it traverses any dangerous zones.

To fix this issue, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that takes into account the weight of the rover. The modified algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the distance matrix to infinity for all zones except the starting zone, which is set to 0.
2. Initialize the priority queue with the starting zone.
3. While the priority queue is not empty:
    1. Pop the zone with the smallest distance from the priority queue.
    2. If the zone is the destination, return the distance.
    3. For each adjacent zone:
        1. If the adjacent zone is dangerous and the rover's weight is less than the stability of the zone, continue.
        2. If the distance to the adjacent zone is greater than the distance to the current zone plus 1, update the distance to the adjacent zone and add it to the priority queue.
