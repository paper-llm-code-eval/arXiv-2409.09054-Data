Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `forta.in` and write to `forta.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Forța unui număr natural nenul $X$ este egală cu numărul de divizori pozitivi ai lui $X$. De exemplu, numărul $X = 10$ are forţa $4$, deoarece $10$ are $4$ divizori, mulțimea divizorilor fiind $D_{10} = \{1,2,5,10\}$.

Scrieţi un program care, cunoscând un șir de $n$ numere naturale nenule, rezolvă următoarele cerințe:

1. determină cel mai mic număr din șir care are forța maximă;
2. determină lungimea maximă a unei secvențe formată din numere cu aceeași forţă ce poate fi obținută prin rearanjarea convenabilă a elementelor din șir.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `forta.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $c$, care reprezintă cerința de rezolvat ($1$ sau $2$), pe a doua linie un număr natural $n$, iar pe următoarea linie $n$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând elementele șirului.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `forta.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $c$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq$ numerele din șir $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* O secvență este constituită dintr-un singur număr sau mai multe numere aflate pe poziții consecutive în șir. Lungimea unei secvențe este egală cu numărul de valori care o compun.
* Pentru prima cerință se acordă $50$ de puncte, iar pentru cea de a doua cerință se acordă $40$ de puncte.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$

The issue with the previous solution was that it was not correctly calculating the force of each number. The force of a number is the number of divisors it has, including 1 and itself.
