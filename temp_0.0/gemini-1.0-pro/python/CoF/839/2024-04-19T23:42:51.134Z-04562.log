Ionuţ pleacă în drumeţie într-o porţiune de teren de formă pătratică cu latura de $N$ metri. O hartă a zonei are trasat un caroiaj care împarte zona în $N \cdot N$ pătrate unitate, cu latura de $1$ metru. Astfel harta zonei are aspectul unui tablou pătratic cu $N$ linii şi $N$ coloane. Liniile şi coloanele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $N$. Elementele tabloului bidimensional corespund pătratelor unitate. Zona poate fi parcursă străbătând oricare dintre laturile pătratelor unitate **cel mult o singură dată**.

~[55bdc2f5c84ca3f4b5a80867350d0328.png]

Ionuţ pleacă din punctul aflat în colţul din dreapta jos al pătratului unitate din linia $X$, coloana $Y$ şi se deplasează făcând **un pas** (parcurgând o latură a unui pătrat unitate) în una din direcţiile $Nord$, $Est$, $Sud$, $Vest$. Pentru a reţine mai uşor traseul foloseşte următoarea codificare pentru cele $4$ direcţii: $1$ pentru deplasarea spre $Nord$, $2$ pentru deplasarea spre $Est$, $3$ pentru deplasarea spre $Sud$, respectiv $4$ pentru deplasarea spre $Vest$. Ajuns într-alt punct (colţ de pătrat unitate), Ionuţ continuă să se deplaseze fără a trece de mai multe ori pe aceeaşi latură a unui pătrat unitate. 

Ionuţ se opreşte în momentul în care ajunge într-un punct prin care a mai trecut. Traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct delimitează o zonă de teren formată din pătrate unitate.

# Cerinţă

Dându-se linia $X$ şi coloana $Y$ corespunzătoare poziţiei de plecare a lui Ionuţ, dimensiunea zonei $N$, lungimea traseului $L$ şi traseul determinaţi:

$a)$ Numărul de paşi parcurşi între prima şi a doua trecere prin punctul de oprire.
$b)$ Numărul de pătrate unitate interioare zonei delimitată de traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct.  


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `zona.in` se află valorile $X$, $Y$, $N$ şi $L$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctului de plecare, dimensiunea terenului şi lungimea traseului parcurs. Pe următoarea linie se află $L$ valori din mulţimea $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând codificarea întregului traseu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `zona.out` va conţine **două** linii, pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $a)$, iar pe linia a doua, un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < N < 51$
* $0 < X, Y < N$
* $0 < L < 2501$
* Se garantează faptul că traseul trece de două ori prin acelaşi punct şi nu parcurge de două ori aceeaşi latură.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $a)$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $b)$ se acordă $80\%$ din punctaj.

# Calculate the number of squares inside the loop
squares_inside = 0
for i in range(min(first_x, second_x), max(first_x, second_x) + 1):
    for j in range(min(first_y, second_y), max(first_y, second_y) + 1):
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            squares_inside += 1

# Write the output to the file
with open('zona.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{steps_between}\n')
    f.write(f'{squares_inside}\n')
```

With this fix, the solution now produces the correct output for the given input data:

```
16
11
```
