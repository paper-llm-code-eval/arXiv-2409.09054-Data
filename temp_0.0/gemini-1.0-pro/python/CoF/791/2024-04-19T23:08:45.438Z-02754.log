Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `vecini.in` and write to `vecini.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră matricea $A$ ale cărei elemente pot avea doar valorile $0$ sau $1$ și în care numerotarea liniilor și numerotarea coloanelor începe de la $1$. Pentru un element oarecare al matricei, definim noțiunea de vecin ca fiind acele elementele din matrice aflate în imediata sa apropiere pe una dintre direcțiile orizontală, verticală sau pe cele două diagonale (vezi figura de mai jos în care s-au marcat cu $x$ vecinii elementului marcat cu $o$). Un vecin bun al elementului $A_{ij}$ este un vecin care are aceeași valoare cu $A_{ij}$.

~[vecini.png]

# Cerință

Dându-se matricea $A$, să se determine numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei precum și numărul de elemente care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `vecini.in` conține pe prima linie trei valori naturale $m \ n \ k$ reprezentând numărul de linii, numărul de coloane și respectiv numărul de valori egale cu $1$ din matricea $A$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii se află două valori $i$ si $j$ cu semnificația $A_{ij}$ este egal cu $1$. Aceste valori sunt date in ordinea parcurgerii matricei pe linii de la linia $1$ la linia $m$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vecini.out` va conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate printr-un singur spațiu: $x$ va reprezenta numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei date, iar $y$ va reprezenta numărul de elemente din matricea dată care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m,n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq k \leq n \cdot m / 2+1$;
* Pentru $30$% dintre teste $2 \leq m,n \leq 200$;

The error is caused by the fact that the variable `numar_max_vecini` is not defined before it is used. To fix this, we can initialize it to 0 before the loop:

```python
max_vecini = 0
numar_max_vecini = 0
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        vecini = a[i][j] + a[i - 1][j - 1] + a[i - 1][j + 1] + a[i + 1][j - 1] + a[i + 1][j + 1] - a[i][j - 1] - a[i][j + 1] - a[i - 1][j] - a[i + 1][j]
        if vecini > max_vecini:
            max_vecini = vecini
            numar_max_vecini = 1
        elif vecini == max_vecini:
            numar_max_vecini += 1
```

Here is the full fixed code:

```python
with open('vecini.in') as f:
    m, n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]
    for _ in range(k):
        i, j = map(int, f.readline().split())
        a[i][j] = 1

for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i][j] += a[i - 1][j] + a[i][j - 1] - a[i - 1][j - 1]

max_vecini = 0
numar_max_vecini = 0
for i in range(1, m + 1):

        vecini = a[i][j] + a[i - 1][j - 1] + a[i - 1][j + 1] + a[i + 1][j - 1] + a[i + 1][j + 1] - a[i][j - 1] - a[i][j + 1] - a[i - 1][j] - a[i + 1][j]

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result is incorrect. The correct result should be 3 6, as there are 6 elements in the matrix that have 3 good neighbors: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 3).

The bug in the code is in the calculation of the number of good neighbors. The code currently counts the number of 1s in the 3x3 submatrix centered at the current element. However, this does not correctly count the number of good neighbors, as it also counts 1s that are not in the same row, column, or diagonal as the current element.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to only count the number of 1s that are in the same row, column, or diagonal as the current element. Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('vecini.in') as f:
    m, n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]
    for _ in range(k):

        a[i][j] = 1

for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i][j] += a[i - 1][j] + a[i][j - 1] - a[i - 1][j - 1]

max_vecini = 0
numar_max_vecini = 0
