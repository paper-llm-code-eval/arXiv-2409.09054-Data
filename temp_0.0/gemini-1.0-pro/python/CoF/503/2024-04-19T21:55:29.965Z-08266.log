Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `bingo.in` and write to `bingo.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Fie $S$ un șir de caractere de lungime $N$ indexat de la 1. Pe un astfel de șir se definește  operația `swap`: se alege un indice $i$ ($1 \leq i < N$) și se interschimbă caracterele $S[i]$ și $S[i+1]$.

Numărul norocos corespunzător unui șir $S$ este egal cu numărul minim de operații `swap` ce trebuie efectuate succesiv pentru a obține cel puțin o subsecvență `bingo` în șirul $S$. Dacă subsecvența `bingo` apare în șirul inițial, numărul norocos este egal cu $0$.

# Cerință

Se dă un număr natural $T$ și $T$ șiruri de caractere. Să se determine pentru fiecare șir dat $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$), numărul său norocos. 

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `bingo.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural nenul $T$. Următoarele $T$ linii conțin fiecare câte un șir de caractere format doar din litere mici ale alfabetului englez.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `bingo.out` conține numerele norocoase determinate pentru fiecare dintre cele $T$ șiruri date. Acestea se vor afișa fiecare pe câte un rând, în ordinea în care șirurile sunt date în fișierul de intrare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq T \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $\sum_{i=1}^{T}|S_i| \leq 100 \ 000$, unde se notează cu $|S|$ numărul de caractere din șirul $S$;
* O subsecvență de lungime $L$ a unui șir de caractere $S$ reprezintă o succesiune de $L$ caractere aflate pe poziții consecutive în șirul $S$.
* Se garantează că fiecare șir citit conține cel puțin o dată fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $|S_i|=5$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$);
* Pentru $21$ de puncte, în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare exact o dată;
* Pentru $11$ puncte, $1 \leq T \leq 10$ și în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare de cel mult 10 ori;
* Pentru $51$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

The provided solution is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the fact that the characters in the string can be swapped. To fix this, we need to find the minimum number of swaps required to bring the characters 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', and 'o' together in the correct order.

Here is the fixed solution in Python:

```python
import sys

def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    pos = [0] * 5
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'b':
            pos[0] = i
        elif s[i] == 'i':
            pos[1] = i
        elif s[i] == 'n':
            pos[2] = i
        elif s[i] == 'g':
            pos[3] = i
        elif s[i] == 'o':
            pos[4] = i
    ans = n
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(i + 1, 5):
            ans = min(ans, abs(pos[i] - pos[j]))
    return ans

with open('bingo.in', 'r') as f:
    t = int(f.readline())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = f.readline().strip()
        with open('bingo.out', 'a') as g:
            g.write(str(solve(s)) + '\n')
```

This solution works by first finding the positions of the characters 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', and 'o' in the string. Then, it calculates the minimum number of swaps required to bring these characters together in the correct order. The minimum number of swaps is the answer to the problem.

The program exited with code 1 because the variable `n` is not defined in the line `ans = mn * 5 - n`. The variable `n` is the length of the string, and it is defined in the line `n = len(s)`. To fix this, we need to move the line `ans = mn * 5 - n` after the line `n = len(s)`.
