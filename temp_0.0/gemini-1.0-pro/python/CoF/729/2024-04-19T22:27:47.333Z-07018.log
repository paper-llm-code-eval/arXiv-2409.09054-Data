Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `siruri.in` and write to `siruri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un vector unidimensional $x$ cu $n$ componente numere naturale distincte, cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să construiască vectorul $y$ cu elemente din mulțimea $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ astfel încât oricare ar fi numerele naturale $i, j$ cu proprietatea că $1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq j \leq n$ și $x_i < x_j$ să avem $y_i < y_j$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `siruri.in` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul $n$
* pe linia a doua componentele vectorului $x$ separate prin câte un spațiu

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `siruri.out` va conține pe prima linie componentele vectorului $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* Componentele vectorului x sunt numere naturale cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

Example:
`siruri.in`

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python

    n = int(f.readline())
    x = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

y = [0] * n
rank = [0] * 32001

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            rank[1 << j] += 1

for i in range(1, 32001):
    rank[i] += rank[i - 1]

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            y[rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1] = i + 1

The program exited with code 1 because the following line:
```python
y[rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1] = i + 1
```
tried to access an index that was out of range. This happened because the value of `rank[x[i] & (1 << j)]` could be equal to `n`, which would make the index `n - 1` out of range for the list `y`.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to make sure that the index is within range before accessing it:
```python
if rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1 < n:
    y[rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1] = i + 1
```

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('siruri.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    x = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

y = [0] * n
rank = [0] * 32001

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            rank[1 << j] += 1

for i in range(1, 32001):
    rank[i] += rank[i - 1]

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            if rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1 < n:
                y[rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1] = i + 1
            break

with open('siruri.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, y)))

The expected output is:
```
5 2 3 6 4 1
```
But the found output is:
```
0 0 2 0 0 5
```

The differences between the expected and found result are:
* The first four elements of the found output are 0, while the expected output has non-zero values.
* The last element of the found output is 5, while the expected output has 1.

The reason for these differences is that the code does not correctly assign values to the `y` list. Specifically, the following line of code is incorrect:
```python
y[rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1] = i + 1
```
This line should be replaced with the following:
```python
y[rank[x[i] & (1 << j)] - 1] = n - i
```

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('siruri.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    x = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

y = [0] * n
rank = [0] * 32001

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            rank[1 << j] += 1

for i in range(1, 32001):
    rank[i] += rank[i - 1]

    for j in range(32):
