Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `patrat.in` and write to `patrat.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Cel mai mare observator astronomic din România și din Europa de Est, aflat la Galați, a captat o imagine a boltei cerești, ce surprinde toate stelele vizibile în acel moment. Imaginea este în format digital, codificată sub forma unui tablou bidimensional, cu $N$ linii și $M$ coloane. Fiecare element al tabloului conține un număr natural care reprezintă intensitatea luminoasă a unei stele.

Numim **stea strălucitoare** o stea care are intensitatea luminoasă mai mare decât a tuturor stelelor învecinate direct cu ea, pe orizontală, verticală sau diagonală. Numim **constelație pătrată** patru stele strălucitoare care se află plasate în colțurile unui pătrat cu laturile paralele cu marginile tabloului. Lungimea laturii unei constelații pătrate este egală cu numărul de stele din care este formată latura. O stea strălucitoare poate face parte din mai multe constelații pătrate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine:
1. Numărul stelelelor strălucitoare;
2. Numărul constelațiilor pătrate;
3. Lungimea laturii pătratului care reprezintă cea mai mare constelație pătrată

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul `patrat.in` se citesc de pe prima linie, două numere naturale $N$ și $M$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând dimensiunile tabloului bidimensional, iar de pe următoarele $N$ linii, câte $M$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând intensitatea luminoasă a stelelor.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul `patrat.out` se va scrie pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $1$. Pe cea de-a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$. Pe a treia linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $3$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 200$;
* $1 < M \leq 200$;
* $1 \leq$ intensitatea unei stele $\leq 1 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $1$ se acordă $40\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test, pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $2$ se acordă $40\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $3$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test.
* Respectaţi formatul fişierului de ieşire! Pentru a obţine punctajul acordat unei cerinţe, trebuie ca răspunsul din fişier să fie corect şi scris exact pe linia precizată în enunţ.

The error is caused by trying to access elements outside the bounds of the grid. This can be fixed by adding checks to make sure that the indices are within the bounds of the grid before accessing them.

Here is the fixed code:

```python

    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result incorrectly counts the number of squares and the length of the side of the largest square.

The error in the code is in the following line:

```python
if all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i, j+1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)] if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m):
```

This line checks if the current cell is brighter than the cells to its right, below, and diagonally below-right. However, it does not check if the current cell is brighter than the cells to its left, above, and diagonally above-right.

To fix this, the line should be changed to:

```python
if all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i, j+1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j-1)] if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m):
