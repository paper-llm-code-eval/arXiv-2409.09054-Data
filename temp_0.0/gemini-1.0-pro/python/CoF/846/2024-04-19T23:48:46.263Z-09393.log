Cel mai mare observator astronomic din România și din Europa de Est, aflat la Galați, a captat o imagine a boltei cerești, ce surprinde toate stelele vizibile în acel moment. Imaginea este în format digital, codificată sub forma unui tablou bidimensional, cu $N$ linii și $M$ coloane. Fiecare element al tabloului conține un număr natural care reprezintă intensitatea luminoasă a unei stele.

Numim **stea strălucitoare** o stea care are intensitatea luminoasă mai mare decât a tuturor stelelor învecinate direct cu ea, pe orizontală, verticală sau diagonală. Numim **constelație pătrată** patru stele strălucitoare care se află plasate în colțurile unui pătrat cu laturile paralele cu marginile tabloului. Lungimea laturii unei constelații pătrate este egală cu numărul de stele din care este formată latura. O stea strălucitoare poate face parte din mai multe constelații pătrate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine:
1. Numărul stelelelor strălucitoare;
2. Numărul constelațiilor pătrate;
3. Lungimea laturii pătratului care reprezintă cea mai mare constelație pătrată

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul `patrat.in` se citesc de pe prima linie, două numere naturale $N$ și $M$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând dimensiunile tabloului bidimensional, iar de pe următoarele $N$ linii, câte $M$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând intensitatea luminoasă a stelelor.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul `patrat.out` se va scrie pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $1$. Pe cea de-a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$. Pe a treia linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $3$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 200$;
* $1 < M \leq 200$;
* $1 \leq$ intensitatea unei stele $\leq 1 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $1$ se acordă $40\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test, pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $2$ se acordă $40\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $3$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test.
* Respectaţi formatul fişierului de ieşire! Pentru a obţine punctajul acordat unei cerinţe, trebuie ca răspunsul din fişier să fie corect şi scris exact pe linia precizată în enunţ.

The error is caused by trying to access elements outside the bounds of the grid. This can happen when `i` or `j` is 0 or `n-1` or `m-1`. To fix this, we can add checks to make sure that we are not accessing elements outside the bounds of the grid.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('patrat.in') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

stars = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if (i > 0 and j > 0 and i < n-1 and j < m-1 and
                all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)])):
            stars += 1

The reason for the incorrect output is that the code does not correctly check for stars. In the code, a star is defined as a cell that is greater than all of its neighbors. However, the code only checks the neighbors that are in the same row, column, or diagonal. It does not check the neighbors that are in the corners.

To fix this, we can add checks for the corner neighbors. Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('patrat.in') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

The reason for the incorrect output is that the code does not correctly check for squares. In the code, a square is defined as a group of four stars that are arranged in a square. However, the code only checks for squares that are aligned with the rows and columns. It does not check for squares that are rotated by 45 degrees.

To fix this, we can add checks for the rotated squares. Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('patrat.in') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

            stars += 1

        if (i > 0 and j > 0 and
                all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i, j+1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)])):
            side = 2
            while i+side < n and j+side < m and (i > 0 and j > 0 and

The reason for the incorrect output is that the code does not correctly count the number of squares. In the code, a square is defined as a group of four stars that are arranged in a square. However, the code counts each square twice.

To fix this, we can keep track of the squares that have already been counted. Here is the fixed code:
```python

    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

The reason for the incorrect output is that the code does not correctly count the number of squares. In the code, a square is defined as a group of four stars that are arranged in a square. However, the code counts each square twice.

To fix this, we can keep track of the squares that have already been counted. Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('patrat.in') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

stars = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if (i > 0 and j > 0 and i < n-1 and j < m-1 and
                all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1), (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)])):
            stars += 1

squares = 0
max_side = 0
counted = set()
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        if (i > 0 and j > 0 and
                all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i, j+1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)]) and
                (i, j) not in counted and (i, j+1) not in counted and (i+1, j) not in counted and (i+1, j+1) not in counted):
            side = 2
            while i+side < n and j+side < m and (i > 0 and j > 0 and
                    all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i+side, j), (i, j+side), (i+side, j+side)])):
                side += 1
            squares += 1
            max_side = max(max_side, side-1)
            counted.add((i, j))
            counted.add((i, j+1))
            counted.add((i+1, j))
            counted.add((i+1, j+1))
        if (i > 0 and j > 0 and
                all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i-1, j+1), (i, j+1), (i+1, j+1)]) and
                (i, j) not in counted and (i-1, j+1) not in counted and (i, j+1) not in counted and (i+1, j+1) not in counted):
            side = 2
            while i-side >= 0 and j+side < m and (i > 0 and j > 0 and
                    all(grid[i][j] > grid[x][y] for x, y in [(i-side, j+1), (i, j+1), (i-side, j+1)])):
                side += 1
            squares += 1
            max_side = max(max_side, side-1)
            counted.add((i, j))
            counted.add((i-1, j+1))
            counted.add((i, j+1))
            counted.add((i+1, j+1))

with open('patrat.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{stars}\n{squares}\n{max_side}')
```
