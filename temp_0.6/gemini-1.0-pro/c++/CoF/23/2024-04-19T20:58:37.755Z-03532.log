Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.
* Pentru teste in valoare de `18` puncte datele de intrare sunt cunoscute. Mai precis:
Testul 0 : `n = 91, e = 90`
Testul 1 : `n = 30, e = 435`
Testul 2 : `n = 7, e = 16`
* Pentru alte teste in valoare de `15` puncte `n≤9`.

The bug in the previous solution was that it was not checking if there is enough water in the bucket to pour into the next bucket.

Here is the fixed solution:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  FILE *in = fopen("galeti.in", "r");
  FILE *out = fopen("galeti.out", "w");

  int n, e;
  fscanf(in, "%d%d", &n, &e);

  vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);
  vector<int> degree(n + 1, 0);

  int a = 1, b = 2;
  while (e > 0) {
    if (e >= degree[a]) {
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      degree[b]++;
      e -= degree[a];
    } else {
      adj[a].push_back(b);
      degree[b]++;
      e = 0;
    }

    if (a == n) {

The previous solution was incorrect because it did not take into account the fact that the effort required to pour water from one bucket to another is equal to the amount of water in the first bucket.

Here is a corrected solution:

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  FILE *in = fopen("galeti.in", "r");
  FILE *out = fopen("galeti.out", "w");

  int n, e;
  fscanf(in, "%d%d", &n, &e);

  vector<int> water(n + 1, 1);

  int a = 1, b = 2;
  while (e > 0) {
    if (water[a] >= e) {
      water[a] -= e;
      water[b] += e;
      fprintf(out, "%d %d\n", a, b);
      e = 0;
    } else {
      water[b] += water[a];

      }
    }
  }

  fclose(in);
  fclose(out);
  return 0;
}
```

This solution works by keeping track of the amount of water in each bucket. When the amount of water in the first bucket is greater than or equal to the effort required to pour water from one bucket to another, the water is poured and the effort is set to 0. Otherwise, the water is poured from the first bucket to the second bucket, the effort is decremented by the amount of water poured, and the first bucket is emptied. The process is repeated until all of the water is in the first bucket.
