Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sdistante.in` and write to `sdistante.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Definim _distanța_ dintre două șiruri de caractere de aceeași lungime ca fiind numărul minim de caractere ce trebuie modificate (înlocuite fiecare cu câte un alt caracter) în primul șir pentru a obține al doilea șir. Vom nota distanța dintre șirurile $a$ și $b$ cu $dist(a, b)$.


De exemplu, $dist($`abc`$,\ $`aaa`$) = 2$ (înlocuim caracterul `b` cu `a`, respectiv caracterul `c` cu `a`), iar $dist($`ABC`$,\ $`abc`$) = 3$ (literele mici se consideră diferite de cele mari).

Definim o _subsecvență_ a unui șir $s$ de caractere ca fiind un șir format din caractere de pe poziții consecutive din $s$. Considerăm două subsecvențe ca fiind distincte dacă încep sau se termină la poziții diferite. Vom nota cu $s(i, j)$ subsecvența formată din caracterele indexate de la $i$ la $j$ ale șirului $s$. Șirurile se indexează de la $0$. Exemplu: pentru șirul $s = $ `abc` subsecvențele sunt $s(0, 0) = $ `a`, $s(1, 1) = $ `b`, $s(2, 2) = $ `c`, $s(0, 1) = $ `ab`, $s(1, 2) = $ `bc`, $s(0, 2) = $ `abc`, iar pentru șirul $s = $ `aa` acestea sunt $s(0, 0) =$ `a`, $s(1, 1) =$ `a`, $s(0, 1) =$ `aa`.

# Cerință

Se dă un șir de caractere $s$, care poate conține doar litere mici și mari ale alfabetului englez (de la `a` la `z` și de la `A` la `Z`). Pentru toate perechile neordonate de subsecvențe distincte ale șirului $s$ care au lungimi egale, vrem să calculăm distanța dintre ele și să afișăm suma acestora $\text{mod }10^9 + 7$.

Formal, se cere suma valorilor $dist(s(a, b), s(c, d))$, pentru toți indicii $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ cu $0 ≤ a, b, c, d < |s|, a < c, a ≤ b, c ≤ d, b − a = d − c$, $\text{mod }10^9 + 7$. $|s|$ reprezintă lungimea șirului $s$, care este indexat de la $0$.


# Date de intrare


Pe singura linie a fișierului `sdistante.in` este șirul dat, $s$.


# Date de ieșire


Se va afișa pe singurul rând al fișierului `sdistante.out` un număr întreg reprezentând suma distanțelor, $\text{mod }10^9 + 7$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $|s| ≤ 4 \ 000 \ 000$, unde $|s|$ este lungimea șirului $s$.
* Pentru $11$ puncte, $|s| ≤ 20$, $s$ conține doar litere mici.
* Pentru alte 5 puncte, $|s| ≤ 50$, $s$ conține doar caracterele `a` și `b`.
* Pentru alte 15 puncte, $|s| ≤ 350$, $s$ conține doar litere mici.
* Pentru alte 6 puncte, $|s| ≤ 1 \ 000$, $s$ conține doar caracterele `a` și `b`.
* Pentru alte 30 puncte, $|s| ≤ 5 \ 000$, $s$ conține doar litere mici.
* Pentru alte 5 puncte, $|s| ≤ 100 \ 000$, $s$ conține doar caracterele `a` și `b`.
* Pentru alte 4 puncte, $|s| ≤ 100 \ 000$, $s$ conține doar litere mici.
* Pentru alte 6 puncte, $|s| ≤ 1 \ 000 \ 000$, $s$ conține doar caracterele `a` și `b`.
* Pentru alte 18 puncte, fără restricții suplimentare.

The issue with the previous solution was that it didn't count the distance between overlapping substrings. To fix this, we can use a sliding window approach, where we keep track of the number of unique characters in the current window. When we move the window, we can update the count of unique characters in O(1) time.

Here is the corrected solution in c++:
```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

ifstream fin("sdistante.in");
ofstream fout("sdistante.out");

typedef long long ll;
const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;

char s[4000001];
int cnt[26];
ll ans;

int main() {
    fin >> s;
    int n = strlen(s);
    for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        ++cnt[s[r] - 'a'];
        while (l < r && cnt[s[r] - 'a'] > 1) {
            --cnt[s[l] - 'a'];
            ++l;
        }
        ans += (ll)(r - l + 1) * (r - l) / 2;
        ans %= MOD;
    }
    fout << ans << '\n';

The issue with the previous solution was that it didn't handle the case when the current character is the same as the previous character. To fix this, we can simply check if the current character is the same as the previous character, and if it is, we can skip the current character.
