Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `balaur.in` and write to `balaur.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

A fost o dată un balaur cu $6$ capete. Într-o zi, Făt-Frumos s-a supărat și i-a tăiat un cap. Peste noapte i-au crescut alte $6$ capete în loc. Pe același gât! A doua zi, Făt-Frumos iar i-a tăiat un cap, dar peste noapte balaurului i-au crescut în loc alte $6$ capete... și tot așa timp de $n$ zile. În cea de a ($n+1$)-a zi, Făt-Frumos s-a plictisit și a plecat acasă!

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de zile, și calculează câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `balaur.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `balaur.out` va conține un singur număr reprezentînd câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 400 \ 000 \ 000$

Example:
`balaur.in`
```

```

`balaur.out`
```
15
```

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
3
```
Expected output:
```
15
```
Found output:
```
13
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The issue with the previous solution is that it computes $2^n + 5$ instead of $6^n + 5$. Here is the corrected solution:

```c++
#include <fstream>

int main() {
  std::ifstream in("balaur.in");
  std::ofstream out("balaur.out");
  int n;
  in >> n;
  out << (1LL << (3 * n)) + 5;
  return 0;
}
