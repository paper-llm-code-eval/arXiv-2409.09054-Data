Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `forta.in` and write to `forta.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Forța unui număr natural nenul $X$ este egală cu numărul de divizori pozitivi ai lui $X$. De exemplu, numărul $X = 10$ are forţa $4$, deoarece $10$ are $4$ divizori, mulțimea divizorilor fiind $D_{10} = \{1,2,5,10\}$.

Scrieţi un program care, cunoscând un șir de $n$ numere naturale nenule, rezolvă următoarele cerințe:

1. determină cel mai mic număr din șir care are forța maximă;
2. determină lungimea maximă a unei secvențe formată din numere cu aceeași forţă ce poate fi obținută prin rearanjarea convenabilă a elementelor din șir.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `forta.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $c$, care reprezintă cerința de rezolvat ($1$ sau $2$), pe a doua linie un număr natural $n$, iar pe următoarea linie $n$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând elementele șirului.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `forta.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $c$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq$ numerele din șir $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* O secvență este constituită dintr-un singur număr sau mai multe numere aflate pe poziții consecutive în șir. Lungimea unei secvențe este egală cu numărul de valori care o compun.
* Pentru prima cerință se acordă $50$ de puncte, iar pentru cea de a doua cerință se acordă $40$ de puncte.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$

The program exited with code 139 because there was a segmentation fault. This means that the program tried to access memory that it was not allowed to access. In this case, the error is most likely caused by the fact that the program is trying to access elements of the vector `v` that are out of bounds.

To fix the program, we need to make sure that we only access elements of the vector that are within bounds. We can do this by checking the size of the vector before accessing any of its elements.

Here is the corrected code:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("forta.in");
    ofstream out("forta.out");
    int c, n, i, x, j, mx = 0, p = 0, l = 1, ml = 1;
    vector<int> v[1000001];
    in >> c >> n;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        in >> x;
        v[x].push_back(i);
        mx = max(mx, x);
    }
    for (i = 1; i <= mx; i++) {
        if (v[i].size() > p) {
            p = v[i].size();
            j = i;
        }
        if (v[i].size()) {
            if (v[i].size() == ml) {
                l = max(l, v[i].back() - v[i][0] + 1);
            }
            if (v[i].size() > ml) {
                l = v[i].back() - v[i][0] + 1;
                ml = v[i].size();
            }
        }
