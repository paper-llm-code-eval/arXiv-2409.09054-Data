Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `maxp.in` and write to `maxp.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 200 \ 000$;
* Elementele șirului sunt numere naturale și au cel mult $6$ cifre
* Se acordă 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea corectă a celei mai mari puteri a unui element din șir și 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea numărului de elemente din şir care au cea mai mare putere.

`maxp.in`

9 3 4 5 1 2 2
```

`maxp.out`

The bug in the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly calculate the power of an element.
The power of an element is the number of sequences that contain the element and in which the element is strictly greater than the other elements of each of those sequences.
In the previous solution, the power of an element was calculated by counting the number of elements that are smaller than the element to the right and to the left of it.
However, this is not correct because it doesn't take into account the possibility that there are multiple elements that are smaller than the element to the right and to the left of it.
For example, in the input `9 3 4 5 1 2 2`, the power of the element `9` is not `4` but `12` because there are `12` sequences that contain the element `9` and in which the element `9` is strictly greater than the other elements of each of those sequences.
