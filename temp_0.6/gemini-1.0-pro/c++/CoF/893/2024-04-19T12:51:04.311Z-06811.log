Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `patrate.in` and write to `patrate.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un elev a desenat un set format din mai multe pătrate care conțin numere naturale nenule, distincte, consecutive, dispuse în număr egal pe laturi. Pe latura fiecărui pătrat sunt scrise un număr impar de valori. În fiecare pătrat, numerele sunt scrise în ordine crescătoare parcurgând laturile sale, începând din colțul stânga-jos, în sensul invers al acelor de ceasornic. Elevul a numerotat pătratele cu $1$, $2$, $3$ etc. , în ordinea strict crescătoare a numărului de valori conținute de fiecare. Diferența dintre cel mai mic număr din pătratul $P$ ($1$ < $P$) și cel mai mare număr din pătratul $P - 1$ este egală cu $1$. Primele **patru** pătrate sunt:

~[patrate.png]

Astfel, primul pătrat conține numerele naturale distincte consecutive de la $1$ la $8$, dispuse câte **trei** pe fiecare latură a pătratului. Al doilea pătrat conține următoarele $16$ numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte cinci pe fiecare latură. Al treilea pătrat conține următoarele $24$ de numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte șapte pe fiecare latură. Al patrulea pătrat conține următoarele $32$ de numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte nouă pe fiecare latură etc.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care rezolvă următoarele două cerințe:

1. citește un număr natural $M$ și determină numărul $K$ de valori conținute de pătratul numerotat cu $M$;
2. citește un număr natural $N$ și determină numărul $T$ al pătratului care conține numărul $N$ pe una dintre laturi.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `patrate.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând cerința din problemă care trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Dacă $C = 1$, atunci fișierul conține pe a doua linie numărul natural $M$. Dacă $C = 2$, atunci fișierul conține pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $C = 1$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `patrate.out` conține pe prima linie numărul $K$, reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $1$ a problemei. Dacă $C = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `patrate.out` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $T$, reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq M \leq 260 \ 000 \ 000$;
* $7 \leq N \leq 2 \ 147 \ 302 \ 920$;
* Numerele $N$, $M$, $T$ și $K$ sunt numere naturale
* Nu există două pătrate cu același număr de valori scrise pe laturi
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $10$ puncte; pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $80$ de puncte. Se acordă $10$ puncte din oficiu.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly calculate the number of values in the square when the input number `n` is close to the boundary of a square. Specifically, when `n` is greater than or equal to the sum of the values in the current square but less than the sum of the values in the next square, the code incorrectly calculates the number of values in the current square.
To fix this issue, I need to modify the code to correctly handle this case. Here is the fixed code:
```c++
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("patrate.in");
  ofstream out("patrate.out");
  int c, n, t = 0, k = 0, nr = 1, lat = 1, diff = 1;
  in >> c >> n;
  if (c == 1) {
    while (t + diff * lat < n) {
      t += diff * lat;
      lat += 2;
      nr++;
      diff += 2;
    }
    if (t + diff * lat == n) {
      k = diff * lat;
    } else {
      k = diff * (lat - 1);
    }
    out << k << endl;
  } else {
    while (t + diff * lat < n) {
      t += diff * lat;
      lat += 2;
      nr++;
      diff += 2;
    }
    if (t + diff * lat == n) {
      out << nr << endl;
      return 0;
    }
    if (t + diff * (lat - 1) >= n) {
      out << nr << endl;
      return 0;
    }
    if (t + diff * (lat - 2) >= n) {
      out << nr << endl;
      return 0;
    }
    if (t + diff * (lat - 3) >= n) {
      out << nr << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
