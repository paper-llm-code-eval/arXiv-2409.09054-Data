Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `fotbal.in` and write to `fotbal.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Cei $N$ copii de la școala generală vor să formeze o echipă de fotbal compusă din $K$ elevi, dintre care cel puțin unul stângaci și cel puțin unul dreptaci. Pentru fiecare copil $i$ (de la $0$ la $N-1$) se cunoaște intervalul de timp în care acesta este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, sub forma unei perechi, $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$, cât și dacă este stângaci sau dreptaci. $K$ copii pot juca în aceeași echipa dacă intervalele de timp în care aceștia sunt disponibili se suprapun în cel puțin un punct (moment de timp).

# Cerință

Se cere numărul de moduri în care se poate alcătui o echipă cu $K$ dintre cei $N$ elevi; deoarece acest număr poate să fie foarte mare, el se va afișa modulo $10^9+9$.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `fotbal.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc câte 3 numere naturale, $start_{i}$, $end_{i}$, $f_{i}$, unde $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$ reprezintă intervalul de timp în care al $i$-lea copil este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, iar $f_{i}$ reprezintă piciorul cu care joacă al $i$-lea copil, $f_{i}=1$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este dreptaci și $f_{i}=0$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este stângaci.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `fotbal.out` va conține doar numărul de moduri cerut, în forma precizată în cerință. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq start_{i} \leq end_{i} \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* $f_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $K = 2$ și $2 \le N \le 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $K = 2$ și există cel mult $5$ copii care sunt stângaci;
* Pentru $33$ de puncte, $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not correctly calculate the overlap between the intervals of the leftmost and rightmost players in the current window. The overlap should be calculated as the minimum of the right endpoint of the rightmost player and the right endpoint of the k-th player from the left, minus the maximum of the left endpoint of the leftmost player and the left endpoint of the k-th player from the left, plus 1.

Here is the corrected code:
```c++
#include <fstream>

    sort(players.begin(), players.end(), [](const Player& a, const Player& b) {
        return a.start < b.start;
