Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `pinochio.in` and write to `pinochio.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În fiecare zi lucrătoare din săptămână, Pinochio spune câte o minciună datorită căreia nasul acestuia crește cu câte $p$ centimetri pe zi. Sâmbăta și duminica, când vine bunicul Gepeto acasă, pentru a nu-l supăra prea tare, Pinochio reușește să nu spună nici o minciună, ba chiar uitându-se în oglindă observă că în fiecare din aceste zile lungimea nasului său scade cu câte $1$ centimetru pe zi. Când începe o nouă săptămână, rămânând singur acasă Pinochio continuă șirul minciunilor.

# Cerință

Care este dimensiunea nasului lui Pinochio după $k$ zile știind că inițial nasul său măsura $n$ centimetri.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `pinochio.in` se citesc valorile $n$, $p$, $k$, care se găsesc pe prima linie a fișierului și sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


În fișierul de ieșire `pinochio.out` se va afișa pe prima linie un singur număr natural, numărul de centimetri cerut de problemă.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq k \leq 256$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100$;

Example:
`pinochio.in`
```
2 1 8
```

`pinochio.out`
```
6

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

ifstream fin("pinochio.in");
ofstream fout("pinochio.out");
int main() {
  int n, p, k;
  fin >> n >> p >> k;

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
2 1 8
```
Expected output:
```
6
```
Found output:
```
4
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not take into account that on weekends the nose shrinks by 1 cm per day.
Here is the corrected solution:
```c++
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
ifstream fin("pinochio.in");
ofstream fout("pinochio.out");
int main() {
  int n, p, k;
  fin >> n >> p >> k;
  fout << n + k / 5 * (p - 2) + k % 5 * p - (k / 7) * 2 << '\n';

The issue with the previous solution was that it subtracted 2 cm for each week, but it should only subtract 2 cm if the week is complete, i.e. if `k % 7 == 0`.
Here is the corrected solution:

using namespace std;
ifstream fin("pinochio.in");
ofstream fout("pinochio.out");
int main() {
  int n, p, k;
