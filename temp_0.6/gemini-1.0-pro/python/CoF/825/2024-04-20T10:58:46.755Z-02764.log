Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `deal.in` and write to `deal.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

`deal.in`
```

```

`deal.out`
```

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the fact that a tower can be part of multiple deals.
To fix this, we need to keep track of the last deal that each tower is part of.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open("deal.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    h = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))
h.sort()
last_deal = [0] * n
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        if h[j] < h[i] and last_deal[j] < i:
            last_deal[i] = last_deal[j]
    ans = max(ans, h[i] * (n - last_deal[i]))
with open("deal.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(ans))

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the fact that a tower can be part of multiple deals, and that the height of the deal is determined by the height of the tallest tower in the deal.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the height of the tallest tower in each deal.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open("deal.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    h = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))
h.sort()
last_deal = [0] * n
max_height = [0] * n
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        if h[j] < h[i] and last_deal[j] < i:
            last_deal[i] = last_deal[j]
            max_height[i] = max(max_height[i], max_height[j])
    max_height[i] = max(max_height[i], h[i])
    ans = max(ans, max_height[i] * (n - last_deal[i]))
with open("deal.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(ans))

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly update the `max_height` array.
Specifically, it doesn't take into account the case where the current tower is the tallest tower in the deal.

    n = int(f.readline())
    h = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

last_deal = [0] * n

    for j in range(i):

            last_deal[i] = last_deal[j]
            max_height[i] = max(max_height[i], max_height[j])
