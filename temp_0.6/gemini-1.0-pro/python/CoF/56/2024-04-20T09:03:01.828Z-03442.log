Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `zmeu.in` and write to `zmeu.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

The error is caused by the fact that the list `times` is 0-indexed, while the loop iterates from 1 to `p + 1`. This means that when `i` is 1, `times[i - 1]` is `times[0]`, which is out of bounds for the list.

To fix the issue, I can change the loop to iterate from 0 to `p`, and then increment `i` by 1 before accessing `times[i - 1]`. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("zmeu.in") as f_in, open("zmeu.out", "w") as f_out:
        n, p, k = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
        times = []
        for _ in range(p):
            d, c = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
            times.append((d, c))
        graph = [[] for _ in range(p + 1)]
        for _ in range(k):
            a, b = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
            graph[a].append(b)

        dp = [[(1e9, -1)] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
        dp[1][n] = (0, 1)

        for i in range(p):
            for heads in range(n, -1, -1):
                if (dp[i][heads][0] != 1e9 or heads == n) and not graph[i + 1]:
                    dp[i + 1][heads] = min(dp[i + 1][heads], (dp[i][heads][0], i + 1))
                if dp[i][heads][0] != 1e9 and heads >= times[i][1]:
                    dp[i + 1][heads - times[i][1]] = min(
                        dp[i + 1][heads - times[i][1]],
                        (dp[i][heads][0] + times[i][0], i + 1),
                    )

        if dp[p][0][0] != 1e9:

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case where the zmeu has 0 heads. In this case, the zmeu cannot continue to the next story, and the minimum duration should be -1.

To fix this issue, I can add a check at the beginning of each iteration of the loop over `heads` to see if `heads` is 0. If it is, then I can set `dp[i + 1][heads]` to `(1e9, -1)` to indicate that there is no valid path from this state.
