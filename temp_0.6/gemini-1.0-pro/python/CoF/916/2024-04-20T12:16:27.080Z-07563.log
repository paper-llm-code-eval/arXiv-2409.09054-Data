Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `buldo.in` and write to `buldo.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Dorești să nivelezi terenul pe care l-ai cumpărat, care are lățimea de $1$ metru și lungimea de $N$ metri, fiind alcătuit din $N$ zone succesive, fiecare zonă având lungimea de $1$ metru. Terenul se reprezintă ca un șir de $N$ numere naturale $h_1, h_2, h_3, \ldots, h_N$ reprezentând înălțimile în metri pe care le au zonele din terenul inițial, privite de la stânga spre dreapta.
\
Pentru a nivela terenul ai închiriat un buldozer care funcționează astfel. Se alege o înălțime $H$ (număr natural) la care ridicăm lama buldozerului. Inițial buldozerul are pe lamă o cantitate $C=0$ metri cubi de pământ. Buldozerul începe să meargă de la stânga la dreapta și când ajunge la zona $i$, în funcție de înălțimea $h_i$ a acesteia, se va afla în una dintre următoarele situații:
- dacă $h_i \geq H$ atunci cantitatea suplimentară $h_i - H$ se adaugă la $C$ și nivelul zonei ajunge la $H$.
- dacă $h_i < H$ atunci se scade din $C$ diferența $H - h_i$ pentru a aduce nivelul zonei la nivelul $H$.

\
Remarcăm faptul că $H$ trebuie ales inițial astfel încât de fiecare dată când buldozerul ajunge în a doua situație să aibă pe lamă suficient pământ ($C \geq H - h_i$). După ce buldozerul parcurge cele $N$ zone de lungime $1$, pe lama buldozerului e posibil să mai rămână pământ, dar asta nu te interesează, pentru că la capătul din dreapta al terenului este un râu, și pământul rămas se va vărsa acolo.

# Cerință
Scrieți un program care calculează înălțimea maximă $H$ la care poate fi ridicată lama, astfel încât terenul să poată fi nivelat la acea înălțime.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `buldo.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, separate prin câte un spațiu, cele $N$ numere naturale $h_1$, $h_2$, $h_3$, $\dots$, $h_N$, cu semnificația din enunț.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `buldo.out` va conține o singură linie, pe care va fi scris numărul natural $H$ cerut.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Înălțimile sunt numere naturale, $1 \leq h_i \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$, pentru orice $i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 50 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$ și $h_i \leq 1\ 000$, pentru orice $i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not take into account the fact that the buldozer can only add soil to its blade, not remove it. This means that the height of the blade can only increase as the buldozer moves from left to right.

To fix this, we can use a modified version of the algorithm that keeps track of the minimum height of the blade as it moves from left to right. If the minimum height of the blade is ever less than the current height of the terrain, then the buldozer will not be able to level the terrain at the current height.

Here is a fixed version of the solution in python:
```python
with open('buldo.in') as fin, open('buldo.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    h = [int(x) for x in fin.readline().split()]
    h.sort()
    min_height = h[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if h[i] < min_height:
            min_height = h[i]
        else:
            break
    fout.write(str(min_height))
```
This solution works by first sorting the heights of the terrain in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted heights, keeping track of the minimum height of the blade. If the minimum height of the blade is ever less than the current height of the terrain, then the buldozer will not be able to level the terrain at the current height. In this case, the loop is broken and the minimum height of the blade is written to the output file.

To fix this, we can use a modified version of the algorithm that keeps track of the maximum height of the blade as it moves from left to right.
