Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `siruri.in` and write to `siruri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un vector unidimensional $x$ cu $n$ componente numere naturale distincte, cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să construiască vectorul $y$ cu elemente din mulțimea $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ astfel încât oricare ar fi numerele naturale $i, j$ cu proprietatea că $1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq j \leq n$ și $x_i < x_j$ să avem $y_i < y_j$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `siruri.in` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul $n$
* pe linia a doua componentele vectorului $x$ separate prin câte un spațiu

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `siruri.out` va conține pe prima linie componentele vectorului $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* Componentele vectorului x sunt numere naturale cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

Example:
`siruri.in`
```

12 3 7 16 10 1
```

`siruri.out`
```
5 2 3 6 4 1

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:

Expected output:
```

Found output:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The bug in the previous solution was that the `rank` array was not being reset to 0 after each element of `x` was processed. This caused the `rank` array to contain incorrect values for the subsequent elements of `x`.

Here is the corrected solution:
```python
with open("siruri.in") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    x = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

y = [0] * n
rank = [0] * 32001

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            rank[1 << j] += 1
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            y[i] = rank[1 << j]
            rank[1 << j] = 0
            break
