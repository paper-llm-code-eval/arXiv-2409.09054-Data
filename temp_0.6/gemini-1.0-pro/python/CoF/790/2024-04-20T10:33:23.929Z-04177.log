Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `235.in` and write to `235.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Definim o putere a lui $3$ un număr de forma $3^k$, ($k$ număr natural strict pozitiv), o putere a lui $5$ un număr de forma $5^k$ (k număr natural strict pozitiv), iar o putere a lui $2$ un număr de forma $2^k$ ($k$ număr natural strict pozitiv).
Se dă un șir de $n$ numere naturale. Plecând de la acest șir, formăm un nou șir prin eliminarea tuturor numerele care nu sunt puteri ale lui $3$ și nici puteri ale lui $5$. Ordinea relativă între numerele care nu sunt eliminate se păstrează.

# Cerințe

- Să se determine câte numere conține șirul nou format.
- Să se determine de asemenea numărul de secvențe având lungimea egală cu o putere a lui $2$ existente în șirul nou format în care numărul de puteri ale lui $3$ este egal cu numărul de puteri ale lui $5$. O secvență este formată din elemente aflate pe poziții consecutive în acest șir nou format, iar lungimea unei secvențe este egală cu numărul de elemente pe care aceasta îl conține.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie in fișierul `235.in` se afla un număr natural $n$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii câte un număr natural mai mare decât $1$ reprezentând numerele șirului inițial.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului `235.out` se va afla o valoare naturală $m$ care va reprezenta numărul de elemente rămase în șir după eliminare. Pe a doua linie se va afla o valoare naturală $S$ reprezentând numărul de secvențe din șirul nou format care au proprietățile cerute.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 500 \ 000$;
* Numerele din șirul inițial sunt numere naturale din intervalul [$2, 2 \cdot 10^9$].
* Se garantează că $m \leq 40 \ 000$; pentru fiecare set de date de intrare.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a valorii numărului $m$ se acordă $30$% din punctaj iar pentru determinarea corectă a ambelor valori ($m$ şi $s$) se acordă $100$% din punctaj.

The issue with the previous solution is that it counts the numbers that are divisible by both $3$ and $5$ twice. To fix this, we need to count them only once.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open("235.in", "r") as f_in, open("235.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    v = [int(f_in.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
    m = 0
    s = 0
    for x in v:
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            m += 1
            if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
                s += 1
            elif x % 3 == 0:
                s += 1
    f_out.write(f"{m}\n{s}")

The issue with the previous solution is that it counts the numbers that are divisible by both $3$ and $5$ as belonging to both categories, when they should only be counted once. To fix this, we need to decrement the count of numbers divisible by both $3$ and $5$ from the count of numbers divisible by $3$.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open("235.in", "r") as f_in, open("235.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    v = [int(f_in.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
    m = 0
    s = 0
    for x in v:
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            m += 1
            if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
                s += 1
            elif x % 3 == 0:
                s -= 1
    f_out.write(f"{m}\n{s}")

The issue with the previous solution is that it decrements the count of numbers divisible by both $3$ and $5$ from the count of numbers divisible by $3$, even when the count of numbers divisible by both $3$ and $5$ is $0$. This can result in a negative count of numbers divisible by $3$, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we can add a check to ensure that the count of numbers divisible by both $3$ and $5$ is greater than $0$ before decrementing it.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open("235.in", "r") as f_in, open("235.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    v = [int(f_in.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
    m = 0
    s = 0
    for x in v:
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            m += 1
            if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
                s += 1
            elif x % 3 == 0:
                if s > 0:
                    s -= 1
    f_out.write(f"{m}\n{s}")
