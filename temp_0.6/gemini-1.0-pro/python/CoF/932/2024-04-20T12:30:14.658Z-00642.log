Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `formula1.in` and write to `formula1.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

La o cursă de Formula 1, fiecare echipă participantă își construiește propria mașină cu care va concura. Numerotarea mașinilor în concurs este realizată de organizatori cu ajutorul unor stegulețe pătrate ce conțin alternativ, pe fiecare rând (pe orizontală și verticală), pătrățele albe și negre de dimensiuni identice. În figura următoare sunt prezentate, în ordine, stegulețele primelor 4 mașini din concurs. Observăm că fiecare steguleț are cu două rânduri (pe orizontală și verticală) mai mult decât stegulețul precedent, iar în toate cele patru colțuri ale oricărui steguleț se află un pătrățel negru.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește două numere naturale $K$ și $N$ și determină:

1. Câte pătrățele albe și negre sunt în total pe stegulețul mașinii cu numărul $K$;
2. Notând cu $A$ numărul total de pătrățele albe de pe stegulețele primelor $N$ mașini din concurs, câte pătrățele albe și negre sunt în total pe cel mai mare steguleț care conține cel mult $A$ pătrățele albe.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `formula1.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$. Pentru toate testele de intrare, numărul $C$ poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau valoarea $2$ și reprezintă numărul cerinței care trebuie rezolvată. Pe a doua linie a fișierului `formula1.in` se găsesc, în ordine, numerele naturale $K$ și $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $C = 1$, se va rezolva cerința $1$. În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `formula1.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul total de pătrățele existente pe stegulețul mașinii cu numărul $K$.
Dacă $C = 2$, se va rezolva cerința $2$. În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `formula1.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul total de pătrățele existente pe cel mai mare steguleț ce conține cel mult $A$ pătrățele albe.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq N \leq 500 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe se obțin $20$ de puncte, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de a doua cerințe se obțin $80$ de puncte.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open("formula1.in", "r") as f:
    c = int(f.readline())
    k, n = map(int, f.readline().split())

if c == 1:
    with open("formula1.out", "w") as f:
        f.write(str(4 * k * k - 4 * k + 1))
else:
    a = 1
    while a * a <= n:
        a += 2

    with open("formula1.out", "w") as f:

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Here is a fixed and correct solution in python:

```python
with open("formula1.in", "r") as f:
    c = int(f.readline())
    k, n = map(int, f.readline().split())

if c == 1:
    with open("formula1.out", "w") as f:
        f.write(str(4 * k * k - 4 * k + 1))
else:
    a = 1
    while a * a <= n:
        a += 2

    b = 1
    while 4 * b * b - 4 * b + 1 <= n:
        b += 2

    with open("formula1.out", "w") as f:
        f.write(str(4 * b * b - 4 * b + 1))
```

The previous solution was incorrect because it did not take into account that the number of white squares on the largest flag that contains at most `n` white squares may not be equal to `n`.

The fixed solution correctly calculates the number of white squares on the largest flag that contains at most `n` white squares by finding the largest value of `b` such that `4 * b * b - 4 * b + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.

The fixed solution correctly calculates the number of white squares on the largest flag that contains at most `n` white squares by finding the largest value of `a` such that `4 * a * a - 4 * a + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.

Here is a breakdown of the fixed solution:

1. Read the input data from the file `formula1.in`.
2. If the first number in the input data is 1, then write the number of white squares on the flag of the car with number `k` to the file `formula1.out`.
3. Otherwise, find the largest value of `a` such that `4 * a * a - 4 * a + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.
4. Write the number of white squares on the flag of the largest car that has at most `n` white squares to the file `formula1.out`.
