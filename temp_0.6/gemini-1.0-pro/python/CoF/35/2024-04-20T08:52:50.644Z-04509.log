Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `biperm.in` and write to `biperm.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Pentru un număr natural nenul `n`, să considerăm toate numerele naturale nenule mai mici sau egale cu `n`, luând fiecare număr de câte două ori: `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ... , n, n`. Aceste numere le amestecăm aleator, şi le aranjăm pe două linii a câte `n` elemente. Structura astfel obţinută o vom numi o bipermutare. În figurile `1, 2` şi `3` avem câte un exemplu de bipermutare pentru `n=5`. 

O bipermutare este perfectă, dacă ambele linii ale structurii reprezintă câte o permutare (vezi figurile `2` şi `3`).

Prin mutare pe poziţia `p`, înţelegem interschimbarea elementelor de pe aceeaşi coloană `p`. În exemplele de mai jos, bipermutarea perfectă din figura `2` s-a obţinut din bipermutarea din figura `1`, aplicând o mutare pe poziţa `2`. Bipermutarea perfectă din figura `3` s-a obţinut din bipermutarea din figura `1`, aplicând mutări pe poziţiile `1, 2, 4` şi `5`.

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând o bipermutare, determinaţi:
* numărul bipermutărilor perfecte distincte ce se pot obţine prin mutări;
* numărul minim de mutări prin care se poate obţine o bipermutare perfectă;
* o bipermutare perfectă obţinută din bipermutarea iniţială.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `biperm.in` conţine pe prima linie valoarea lui `n`. Următoarele două linii conţin, fiecare, câte `n` elemente separate prin câte un spaţiu, formând o bipermutare.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `biperm.out` va conţine:
* pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând  numărul bipermutărilor perfecte distincte ce se pot obţine din bipermutarea dată, respectiv numărul minim de mutări prin care se poate obţine o bipermutare perfectă; 
* pe următoarele două linii se vor tipări câte n numere separate prin spaţiu, reprezentând o bipermutare perfectă obţinută din bipermutarea dată. 

# Restricţii şi precizări
* `2 < n ≤ 10 000`;
* calculul corect al numărului bipermutărilor perfecte distincte valorează `30%` din punctaj;
* calculul corect al numărului minim de mutări valorează `10%` din punctaj;
* tipărirea unei bipermutări perfecte valorează `60%` din punctaj. Pot exista mai multe soluţii, se va admite orice soluţie corectă;
* se garantează că numărul bipermutărilor perfecte distincte nu depăşeşte `2 000 000 000` pentru niciun test.
* acordarea punctajului la un răspuns corect este condiţionată de existenţa răspunsurilor anterioare, indiferent de corectitudinea lor;
* pentru `40%` din teste `n ≤ 20` 
* pentru `40%` din teste `20 < n ≤ 400`
* pentru `20%` din teste `400 < n ≤ 10 000`

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The error is caused by the fact that the `perfect_bipermutation` variable is not initialized. To fix the issue, I need to initialize it to an empty list before using it.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
