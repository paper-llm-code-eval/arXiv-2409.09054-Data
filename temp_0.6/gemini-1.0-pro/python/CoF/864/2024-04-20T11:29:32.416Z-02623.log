Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cifre.in` and write to `cifre.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un indicator numeric este un dispozitiv de afişaj electronic destinat afişării unei **cifre** zecimale. Acesta conține 7 segmente notate cu `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, ca în figura alăturată.

Afişarea unei cifre se face prin aprinderea unei combinații de segmente:
~[0.png|width=10em|align=right]
- Cifra 0: `a`, `b`, `c` ,`d`,`e`,`f`
- Cifra 1: `b`, `c`
- Cifra 2: `a`, `b`, `d` ,`e`, `g`
- Cifra 3: `a`, `b`, `c` ,`d`, `g`
- Cifra 4: `b`, `c`, `f` ,`g`
- Cifra 5: `a`, `c`, `d` ,`f`, `g`
- Cifra 6: `a`, `c`, `d` ,`e`, `f`, `g`
- Cifra 7: `a`, `b`, `c`
- Cifra 8: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`
- Cifra 9: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `f`, `g`

# Cerință
Cunoscând un număr natural $N$ afișat cu ajutorul mai multor indicatoare numerice, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. Numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.
2. Numărul de numere distincte mai **mari** decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în **plus** față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice și fără a stinge niciun segment dintre cele deja aprinse.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare este `cifre.in`.

Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.

Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire este `cifre.out`.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând numărul de numere distincte mai mari decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în plus, față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq N \leq 10^{19}$
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea $V = 2$.

Example:
`cifre.in`
```
1
823
```

`cifre.out`
```

The issue with the previous solution was that it was incorrectly counting the number of distinct numbers that can be formed by adding at least one more segment to the current number.
For example, for the number `823`, the solution counted `4` for the digit `8` because it can be transformed into `9` by adding one segment, and it counted `2` for the digit `3` because it can be transformed into `8` by adding one segment.
However, the digit `8` can also be transformed into `9` by adding one segment to the digit `2` to the left of it, and the digit `3` can also be transformed into `8` by adding one segment to the digit `2` to the left of it.
Therefore, the correct count for the number `823` should be `2`, not `6`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
with open('cifre.in') as fin, open('cifre.out', 'w') as fout:
    v = int(fin.readline())
    n = fin.readline().strip()
    nr_seg = 0

    else:
        nr_dist = 0
        for i in range(len(n)):
            d = n[i]
            if d == '0':
                if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '0': nr_dist += 1
            else:
                if d == '1':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '1': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '2':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '2': nr_dist += 1

The issue with the previous solution was that it was incorrectly counting the number of distinct numbers that can be formed by adding at least one more segment to the current number.
For example, for the number `823`, the solution counted `1` for the digit `8` because it can be transformed into `9` by adding one segment, and it counted `1` for the digit `3` because it can be transformed into `8` by adding one segment.
However, the digit `8` can also be transformed into `9` by adding one segment to the digit `2` to the left of it, and the digit `3` can also be transformed into `8` by adding one segment to the digit `2` to the left of it.
Therefore, the correct count for the number `823` should be `2`, not `4`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
with open('cifre.in') as fin, open('cifre.out', 'w') as fout:
    v = int(fin.readline())
    n = fin.readline().strip()
    nr_seg = 0
    for d in n:
        if d in '012345689': nr_seg += 7
        elif d == '7': nr_seg += 3
    if v == 1:
        fout.write(str(nr_seg))
    else:
        nr_dist = 0
        for i in range(len(n)):
            d = n[i]
            if d == '0':
                if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '0': nr_dist += 1
            else:
                if d == '1':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '1': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '2':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '2': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '3':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '3': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '4':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '4': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '5':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '5': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '6':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '6': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '7':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '7': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '8':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '8': nr_dist += 1
                elif d == '9':
                    if i == 0 or n[i - 1] != '9': nr_dist += 1
        fout.write(str(nr_dist))
```
