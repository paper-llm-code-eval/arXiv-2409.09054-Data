Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `mouse.in` and write to `mouse.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un experiment urmărește comportarea unui șoricel pus într-o cutie dreptunghiulară, împărțită în $m \times n$ cămăruțe egale de formă pătrată. Fiecare cămăruță conține o anumită cantitate de hrană. Șoricelul trebuie să pornească din colțul $(1,1)$ al cutiei și să ajungă în colțul opus, mâncând cât mai multă hrană. El poate trece dintr-o cameră în una alăturată (două camere sunt alăturate dacă au un perete comun), mănâncă toată hrana din cămăruță atunci când intră și nu intră niciodată într-o cameră în care a mai intrat înainte. 

# Cerință

Stabiliți care este cantitatea maximă de hrană pe care o poate mânca și traseul pe care îl poate urma pentru a culege această cantitate maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mouse.in` conține pe prima linie două numere $m$ și $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii respectiv numărul de coloane ale cutiei, iar pe următoarele $m$ linii cele $m \cdot n$ numere reprezentând cantitatea de hrană existentă în fiecare cămăruță, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `mouse.out` se vor scrie pe prima linie două numere separate printr-un spațiu: numărul de cămăruțe vizitate și cantitatea de hrană maximă culeasă. Pe următoarele linii se va scrie un traseu posibil pentru cantitatea dată, sub formă de perechi de numere, începând cu $(1, 1)$ și terminând cu $(m, n)$.

# Restricții și precizări
- Toate valorile din fișier sunt numere naturale între $1$ și $100$.
- Veți primi 40 de puncte pentru afișarea primelor două numere.

The program exited with code 1 because it tried to access an element of the `food` list that was out of range. This happened because the `max_food` function was called with `i` and `j` values that were less than 1 or greater than `m` and `n`, respectively.

To fix this, I added checks at the beginning of the `max_food` function to make sure that `i` and `j` are within the valid range. I also added similar checks to the `get_path` function.

Here is the fixed code:
```python

The program exited with code 1 because it tried to access an element of the `food` list that was out of range. This happened because the `max_food` function was called with `i` and `j` values that were less than 1 or greater than `m` and `n`, respectively.

To fix this, I added checks at the beginning of the `max_food` function to make sure that `i` and `j` are within the valid range. I also added similar checks to the `get_path` function.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(100000)

def max_food(i, j, food, m, n, visited):
    if (i < 1 or i > m or j < 1 or j > n or visited[i][j]):
        return 0
    visited[i][j] = True
    return food[i][j] + max(max_food(i+1, j, food, m, n, visited), max_food(i-1, j, food, m, n, visited),
                           max_food(i, j+1, food, m, n, visited), max_food(i, j-1, food, m, n, visited))

def get_path(i, j, food, m, n, visited):
    if (i < 1 or i > m or j < 1 or j > n or visited[i][j]):
        return []
    visited[i][j] = True
    max_next = max(get_path(i+1, j, food, m, n, visited), get_path(i-1, j, food, m, n, visited),
                           get_path(i, j+1, food, m, n, visited), get_path(i, j-1, food, m, n, visited))
    if max_next == get_path(i+1, j, food, m, n, visited):
        return [(i+1, j)] + max_next
    if max_next == get_path(i-1, j, food, m, n, visited):
        return [(i-1, j)] + max_next
    if max_next == get_path(i, j+1, food, m, n, visited):
        return [(i, j+1)] + max_next
    if max_next == get_path(i, j-1, food, m, n, visited):
        return [(i, j-1)] + max_next

with open('mouse.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    food = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

visited = [[False for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]
max_food_amount = max_food(1, 1, food, m, n, visited)
visited = [[False for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]
path = get_path(1, 1, food, m, n, visited)

with open('mouse.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{len(path)} {max_food_amount}\n")
    for cell in path:
        f.write(f"{cell[0]} {cell[1]}\n")
```
