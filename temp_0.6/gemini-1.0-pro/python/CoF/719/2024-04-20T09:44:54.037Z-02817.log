Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `templu.in` and write to `templu.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Copa ajunse în Orintia unde există un templu cu mai multe nivele, baza fiind un pătrat de lungime $L$. Primul nivel are înălţimea egală cu $N$, iar celelalte nivele au înălţimea mai mare cu o unitate faţă de cel anterior. Spre exemplu pentru $L = 5$ şi $N = 3$ din stâncă răsări templul (imagine din avion şi de la sol): Copa deschise un document vechi şi citi: „Ca să afli cât aur este în templu, trebuie să însumezi numărul de metri de pe fiecare orizontală…”. Şi Copa socoti: $3+3+3+3+3=15$; $3+4+4+4+3=18$; $3+4+5+4+3=19$; celelalte $18$ şi $15$. „Apoi, trebuie să afli suma numerelor obţinute…”. Iar Copa îşi notă numărul $85$. „Toate numerele obţinute se lipesc pentru a forma cel mai mic număr posibil…”. Şi Copa obţinu numărul: $151518181985$. „Din numărul acesta se caută cel mai mare număr de două cifre alăturate. Aceasta este cantitatea de aur din templu.”. Şi Copa ţipă de bucurie: $98$!.

# Cerință

Plecaţi în Orintia! Veţi primi cele două numere $N$ şi $L$ şi vi se cere să determinaţi numărul obţinut din sume şi cantitatea de aur.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `templu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $N$ şi $L$ separate printr-un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `templu.out` va conţine două linii. Pe câte o linie se va scrie câte un număr. Pe prima linie numărul obţinut din sume, iar pe a doua linie cantitatea de aur.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq L \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq N \leq 50$;

`templu.in`
```

`templu.out`
```
151518181985

Expected program to write result to `templu.out` and read from `templu.in`.
Do not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly calculate the sum of the numbers on each horizontal level of the temple.
The correct formula for calculating the sum on each level is `(L + i) * 4 + L - i`, where `L` is the length of the base of the temple and `i` is the level number.

Here is the corrected solution:
```python
with open('templu.in') as f:
    N, L = map(int, f.readline().split())

sum = 0
for i in range(N):
    sum += (L + i) * 4 + L - i

with open('templu.out', 'w') as f:
    print(sum, file=f)

    s = str(sum)
    max_nr = -1
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        nr = int(s[i:i+2])
        if nr > max_nr:
            max_nr = nr
    print(max_nr, file=f)
