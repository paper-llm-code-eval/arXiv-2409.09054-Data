Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `mostenire.in` and write to `mostenire.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Împăratul cel bătrân vrea să împartă sacii cu galbeni din vistieria palatului celor $K$ feciori ai săi, numerotați de la $1$ la $K$ în ordinea vârstei. Feciorul cu numărul $1$ este cel mai mare, iar mezinul are numărul $K$.

În vistierie sunt $N$ saci plini cu galbeni, așezați în linie, atât de grei încât nu li se poate schimba ordinea, iar pe fiecare sac este scris numărul de galbeni pe care îi conține.
\
Împăratul îl cheamă pe unul dintre feciori și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_1$ saci!”. Feciorul ia sacii și pleacă fericit. Apoi, împăratul cheamă alt fecior și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_2$ saci dintre cei rămași!”. Și așa mai departe, până ajunge la ultimul fecior chemat, căruia îi dă toți sacii rămași.

El nu are o ordine anume în care își cheamă feciorii dar are grijă să cheme fiecare fecior exact o dată. Totodată, pentru a evita certurile între ei, este atent ca fiecare fecior să primească cel puțin un sac cu galbeni, dar **să NU primească în total mai mulți galbeni ca un frate mai mare decât el**. Cel mai mic dintre feciorii împăratului este și cel mai viteaz, așa că împăratul ar vrea să îi dea lui o sumă de bani cât mai mare, fără a-i supăra pe ceilalți feciori ai săi.

# Cerință
Cum ar putea împărți împăratul sacii?

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mostenire.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $K$, separate de un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural, reprezentând numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac, în ordinea în care aceștia urmează să fie distribuiți fiilor.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `mostenire.out` va conține pe prima linie suma de galbeni pe care o va primi fiul cel mic de la împărat. Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al feciorului, respectiv numărul de saci $x_i$ pe care îi primește acesta, în ordinea în care au fost chemați de împărat.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq K \leq 100$
- $K \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac va fi între $1$ și $100\ 000$.
- Galbenii din oricare dintre saci nu pot fi împărțiți mai multor frați.
- Numărul total de galbeni aflați în vistierie este mai mic sau egal cu $10^9$.
- Împăratul cel bătrân nu are doi feciori cu aceeași vârstă.
- **Puteți afișa orice soluție în care mezinul primește numărul maxim posibil de galbeni**.
- Pentru fiecare test, afișarea corectă a numărului maxim de galbeni primiți de mezin este notată cu $40\%$ din punctajul alocat testului.
- Pentru teste valorând 10 puncte, $N = K$ și $N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste valorând 30 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 15$.
- Pentru teste valorând 50 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 100$.

The error is caused by the fact that the input file is empty. The `map` function expects two arguments, but the `sys.stdin.readline().split()` function returns an empty list because there is no input. To fix this, we can add a check to see if the input file is empty before trying to read from it.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

def read_input():
    if not sys.stdin.isatty():
        n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        bags = [int(sys.stdin.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
        return n, k, bags
    else:
        return None, None, None

def solve(n, k, bags):
    # Sort the bags in decreasing order
    bags.sort(reverse=True)

    # Initialize the total number of coins for each son
    coins = [0] * k

    # Initialize the current son
    son = 0

    # Iterate over the bags
    for i in range(n):
        # If the current son has not received any bags yet, give him the current bag
        if coins[son] == 0:
            coins[son] = bags[i]
        # Otherwise, if the current son has received some bags, give him the current bag only if it is greater than the bags received by the previous son

            coins[son] = bags[i]

    # Return the maximum number of coins received by the youngest son
