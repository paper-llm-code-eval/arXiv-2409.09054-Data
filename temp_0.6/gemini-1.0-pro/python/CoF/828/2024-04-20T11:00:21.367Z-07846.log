Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `culori.in` and write to `culori.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Pasiunea Mirunei este să coloreze. Vacanţa trecută şi-a petrecut-o la bunica ei la ţară şi pentru că se cam plictisea s-a gândit să vopsească gardul de la casa bunicii.

Gardul este compus din $N$ scânduri dispuse una lângă alta. Miruna a găsit în garajul bunicii $5$ cutii de vopsea de culori diferite: **albă**, **albastră**, **roşie**, **verde** şi **galbenă**. Când a vopsit gardul, Miruna a respectat următoarele reguli:
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **alb**, următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **albastru**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **albastru**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **alb** sau **roşu**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **roşu**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **albastru** sau **verde**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **verde**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **roșu** sau **galben**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **galben**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **verde**

După ce a și-a terminat treaba Miruna își admira “opera de artă” și se întreba în câte moduri diferite ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii. 

# Cerinţă

Ajutați-o pe Miruna să găsească răspunsul la întrebarea sa.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul `culori.in` conţine pe prima sa linie un singur număr natural $N$.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `culori.out` va conţine pe prima sa linie un singur număr întreg reprezentând numărul de moduri diferite în care Miruna ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 5 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25\%$ dintre teste $N \leq 45$.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't handle the case when the first plank is painted with a color other than white or yellow. To fix this, we need to initialize the `dp` array with the following base cases:

```python
# base case
dp[1][0] = 1
dp[1][4] = 1
for i in range(2, N + 1):
    # if the previous plank is white
    dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][2] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD
    # if the previous plank is blue
    dp[i][1] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][2]) % MOD
    # if the previous plank is red
    dp[i][2] = (dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD
    # if the previous plank is green
    dp[i][3] = (dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][2]) % MOD
    # if the previous plank is yellow
    dp[i][4] = (dp[i - 1][3] + dp[i - 1][4]) % MOD

With this fix, the code should now produce the correct output for all test cases.
