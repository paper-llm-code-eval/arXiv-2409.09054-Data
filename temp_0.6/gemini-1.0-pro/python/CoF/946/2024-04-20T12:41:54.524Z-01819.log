Într-o minunată zi de primăvară, $P$ răţuşte au ieşit la plimbare pe lac. Un pelican milităros, care stătea pe mal, a decis să facă instrucţie cu nevinovatele raţe. Pentru aceasta, a cartografiat imediat lacul şi l-a reprezentat ca o matrice cu N linii (numerotate de la $0$ la $N - 1$ de sus în jos) şi $N$ coloane (numerotate de la $0$ la $N - 1$ de la stânga la dreapta). Astfel, poziţia oricărei raţe pe lac poate fi identificată prin linia şi coloana pe care se află raţa. Raţele sunt orientate cu faţa spre una dintre direcţiile Nord, Sud, Est, Vest. Pelicanul a codificat direcţiile $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ ca în figură.

~[pelican_01.png]

Când pelicanul strigă: “Comanda la mine!” raţele trebuie să execute simultan cele K comenzi pe care le dă pelicanul. Comenzile pelicanului sunt codificate astfel:

* $A \ nr$ – Raţa avansează cu $nr$ poziţii în direcţia spre care este orientată. Dacă avansând depăşeşte marginea tablei de joc va intra pe latura opusă. De exemplu, pe un lac $5$ x $5$, o raţă plasată în poziţia ($1, 3$) cu orientare $1$ (Nord), executând comanda $A \ 3$ se va deplasa astfel: ($1, 3$) $\rarr$ ($0, 3$) $\rarr$ ($4, 3$) $\rarr$ ($3, 3$).
* $R \ nr$ – Raţa se roteşte cu $nr \cdot 90 \degree$ în sens orar, unde $nr \in {1,2,3,4}$. De exemplu, dacă orientarea iniţială a raţei este $1$ (Nord), comanda $R \ 2$ va schimba orientarea spre $3$ (Sud).
* $Z \ nr$ – Raţa zboară pe linia $nr / N$ şi coloana $nr$ mod $N$, păstrând orientarea. Se garantează că $nr / N \in \{0,1, ..., N - 1\}$. De exemplu, pe un lac $5$ x $5$, după executarea comenzii $Z \ 7$, raţa va ajunge pe linia $1$ şi coloana $2$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care, cunoscând poziţia iniţială pe lac a celor $P$ raţe şi succesiunea comenzilor pelicanului, determină poziţia finală a fiecărei raţe.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `pelican.in` conţine pe prima linie trei numere naturale $N \ P \ K$, cu semnificaţia din enunţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii sunt date câte $3$ numere naturale $i \ j \ d$ cu semnificaţia că pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$ se găseşte o raţă orientată în direcţia $d$. Ultimele $K$ linii conţin cele $K$ comenzi, câte o comandă pe o linie, în formatul specificat în enunţ (un caracter din mulţimea {'A', 'R', 'Z'} şi un număr natural). Valorile scrise pe aceeaşi linie sunt separate de câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `pelican.out` va conţine $P$ linii. Pe linia $i$ va fi scrisă poziţia celei de a $i$-a raţe din fişierul de intrare (linia şi coloana separate printr-un singur spaţiu) după executarea în ordine a celor $K$ comenzi.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq P \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq i, j < N$; şi $1 \leq d \leq 4$;
* Mai multe raţe pot ocupa aceeaşi poziţie.
* Se garantează că datele din fişierul de intrare sunt corecte.
* Pentru teste valorând $76$ de puncte fişierul de intrare nu conţine comanda $Z$.
* Pentru teste valorând $20$ de puncte $N \leq 100$, $P \leq 100$ şi $K \leq 1 000$.
* Pentru teste valorând $36$ de puncte $N > 100$, $1 \ 000 \leq P \leq 5 000$; şi $K \leq 50 \ 000$.

The error is caused by the fact that the value of `n` is a string, not an integer. To fix this, we need to convert `n` to an integer before adding it to `i`.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

# Read input from file
with open("pelican.in", "r") as f:
    N, P, K = map(int, f.readline().split())
    ducks = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]
    commands = [f.readline().split() for _ in range(K)]

# Initialize grid with ducks' positions
grid = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
for i, j, d in ducks:
    grid[i][j] = d

# Execute commands
for c, n in commands:
    if c == 'A':
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if grid[i][j] != 0:
                    if grid[i][j] == 1:
                        grid[i][j] = (i - int(n)) % N + 1
                    elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                        grid[i][j] = (i + int(n)) % N + 1
                    elif grid[i][j] == 3:
                        grid[i][j] = (j + int(n)) % N + 1
                    elif grid[i][j] == 4:
                        grid[i][j] = (j - int(n)) % N + 1

The reason why the results differ is that the code does not correctly handle the case when a duck's position is updated to a position that is already occupied by another duck. In this case, the code simply overwrites the existing duck's position with the new duck's position.

To fix this, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the ducks' positions. The dictionary will map each duck's position to the duck's orientation. When a duck's position is updated, we will first check if the new position is already occupied by another duck. If it is, we will update the dictionary to reflect the new duck's orientation. Otherwise, we will simply update the duck's position in the grid.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

# Read input from file
with open("pelican.in", "r") as f:
    N, P, K = map(int, f.readline().split())
    ducks = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]
    commands = [f.readline().split() for _ in range(K)]

# Initialize grid with ducks' positions
grid = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
for i, j, d in ducks:
    grid[i][j] = d

# Initialize dictionary to keep track of ducks' positions
positions = {}
for i, j, d in ducks:
    positions[(i, j)] = d

# Execute commands
for c, n in commands:
    if c == 'A':
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if grid[i][j] != 0:
                    if grid[i][j] == 1:
                        new_i = (i - int(n)) % N
                    elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                        new_i = (i + int(n)) % N

                        positions[(new_i, new_j)] = grid[i][j]
                    else:

The error is caused by a typo in line 33 of the code. The variable `new_j` is used in the if statement, but it is not defined. The correct variable name is `new_i`.

Here is the fixed code:

```python

    N, P, K = map(int, f.readline().split())
    ducks = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]
    commands = [f.readline().split() for _ in range(K)]

# Initialize grid with ducks' positions
grid = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
for i, j, d in ducks:
    grid[i][j] = d

# Initialize dictionary to keep track of ducks' positions
positions = {}
for i, j, d in ducks:
    positions[(i, j)] = d

# Execute commands

    if c == 'A':
