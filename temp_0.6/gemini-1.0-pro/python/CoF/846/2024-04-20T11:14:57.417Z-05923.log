Cel mai mare observator astronomic din România și din Europa de Est, aflat la Galați, a captat o imagine a boltei cerești, ce surprinde toate stelele vizibile în acel moment. Imaginea este în format digital, codificată sub forma unui tablou bidimensional, cu $N$ linii și $M$ coloane. Fiecare element al tabloului conține un număr natural care reprezintă intensitatea luminoasă a unei stele.

Numim **stea strălucitoare** o stea care are intensitatea luminoasă mai mare decât a tuturor stelelor învecinate direct cu ea, pe orizontală, verticală sau diagonală. Numim **constelație pătrată** patru stele strălucitoare care se află plasate în colțurile unui pătrat cu laturile paralele cu marginile tabloului. Lungimea laturii unei constelații pătrate este egală cu numărul de stele din care este formată latura. O stea strălucitoare poate face parte din mai multe constelații pătrate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine:
1. Numărul stelelelor strălucitoare;
2. Numărul constelațiilor pătrate;
3. Lungimea laturii pătratului care reprezintă cea mai mare constelație pătrată

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul `patrat.in` se citesc de pe prima linie, două numere naturale $N$ și $M$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând dimensiunile tabloului bidimensional, iar de pe următoarele $N$ linii, câte $M$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând intensitatea luminoasă a stelelor.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul `patrat.out` se va scrie pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $1$. Pe cea de-a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$. Pe a treia linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $3$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 200$;
* $1 < M \leq 200$;
* $1 \leq$ intensitatea unei stele $\leq 1 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $1$ se acordă $40\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test, pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $2$ se acordă $40\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei $3$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctajul fiecărui test.
* Respectaţi formatul fişierului de ieşire! Pentru a obţine punctajul acordat unei cerinţe, trebuie ca răspunsul din fişier să fie corect şi scris exact pe linia precizată în enunţ.

The error is caused by trying to access `grid[i][j+3]` when `i` and `j` are both equal to `n-1` and `m-1`, respectively. This is out of bounds because the grid is `n` by `m`.

To fix the issue, we can change the range of `k` in the following line:

```python
all(grid[i][j] > grid[i][j+k] for k in range(1, 4))
```

to:

```python
all(grid[i][j] > grid[i][j+k] for k in range(1, min(4, m-j)))
```

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open("patrat.in") as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

ans1 = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if all(grid[i][j] > grid[i][k] for k in range(j)) and \

           all(grid[i][j] > grid[i+k][j+k] for k in range(max(0, i-j), min(n-i, m-j))):

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly count the number of stars in a constellation. Specifically, it does not count the stars that are on the edges of the constellation.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The previous solution would count the following constellation as having 4 stars:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

However, this constellation actually has 9 stars, because it includes the stars on the edges.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to count the stars on the edges of the constellation. Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open("patrat.in") as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

ans1 = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if all(grid[i][j] > grid[i][k] for k in range(j)) and \
           all(grid[i][j] > grid[k][j] for k in range(i)) and \
           all(grid[i][j] > grid[i+k][j+k] for k in range(max(0, i-j), min(n-i, m-j))):
            ans1 += 1

ans2 = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        if all(grid[i][j] > grid[i+k][j] for k in range(1, min(4, n-i))) and \
           all(grid[i][j] > grid[i][j+k] for k in range(1, min(4, m-j))) and \
           all(grid[i][j] > grid[i+k][j+k] for k in range(1, min(4, n-i, m-j))) and \
           all(grid[i][j] > grid[i+k][j-k] for k in range(1, min(4, n-i, m-j))):
            ans2 += 1

ans3 = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        for k in range(1, min(n-i, m-j)):
            if all(grid[i][j] > grid[i+l][j+l] for l in range(k)):
                ans3 = max(ans3, k)

with open("patrat.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"{ans1}\n{ans2}\n{ans3}")
```

With this fix, the code will correctly count the number of stars in a constellation, including the stars on the edges.
