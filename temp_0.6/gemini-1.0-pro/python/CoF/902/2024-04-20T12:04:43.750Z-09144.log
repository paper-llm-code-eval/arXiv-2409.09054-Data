Cel mai nou proiect imobiliar din capitală este compus din $N$ blocuri-turn, construite unul lângă altul, de-a lungul unui bulevard central și numerotate de la $1$ la $N$. Pentru fiecare turn se cunoaște numărul etajelor din care este compus acesta și se mai știe că nu există două turnuri cu același număr de etaje. Ultimele norme urbanistice definesc **coeficientul de frumusețe** al turnului cu numărul $T$, ca fiind numărul turnurilor din secvența de turnuri care începe cu turnul $S$, se termină cu turnul $D$ și are următoarele proprietăți:
* $1 \leq S \leq T \leq D \leq N$
* numărul etajelor fiecărui turn din secvență, cu excepţia turnului $T$, este mai mic decât numărul de etaje ale turnului $T$
* Dacă $S ≠ 1$ atunci turnul $S-1$ este cel mai apropiat turn din stânga turnului $T$, care are un număr de etaje strict mai mare decât turnul $T$
* Dacă $D ≠ N$ atunci turnul $D+1$ este cel mai apropiat turn din dreapta turnului $T$, care are un număr de etaje strict mai mare decât turnul $T$

**Coeficientul de frumusețe al întregului ansamblu de turnuri** este suma coeficienților de frumusețe avuţi de turnurile componente. Dezvoltatorul proiectului dorește să renunțe la unul dintre turnuri și să construiască în locul acestuia un restaurant subteran, acesta considerându-se un turn cu **zero** etaje. Dezvoltatorul dorește să calculeze coeficientul de frumusețe al ansamblului de turnuri, pentru fiecare posibilă amplasare a restaurantului.

# Cerință

Cunoscând numărul $N$ de turnuri și numărul etajelor fiecăruia, determinați coeficientul de frumusețe al ansamblului de turnuri pentru toate cele $N$ posibilități de amplasare ale restaurantului, pe pozițiile $1$, $2$, ..., $N$.

# Date de intrare


Datele de intrare se citesc din fişierul `turnuri.in`, care are următoarea structură:

* pe prima linie se află numărul natural $N$, reprezentând numărul de turnuri
* pe a doua linie se află $N$ valori naturale nenule, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând numărul etajelor turnurilor

# Date de ieșire


Datele de ieşire se vor scrie în fişierul `turnuri.out`, pe linii separate, astfel: pe linia $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq N$) se găsește un număr natural reprezentând coeficientul de frumusețe al ansamblului dacă restaurantul s-ar construi în locul turnului $i$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$
* Numărul de etaje ale unui turn este un număr natural între $1$ și $1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$
* Se acordă $10$ puncte din oficiu.

| Subtask | Punctaj | Restricții          |
| - | ------- | ------------------- |
| 1 | 30      | $N \leq 100$ |
| 2 | 30      | $N \leq 2 \ 000$      |
| 3 | 30      | Fără restricții suplimentare.      |

The bug in the previous solution was in the calculation of the beauty coefficients. The beauty coefficient of a tower is the sum of the beauty coefficients of all the towers that are strictly smaller than it and that are located between its left and right greater towers. In the previous solution, the beauty coefficient of a tower was calculated as the sum of the beauty coefficients of all the towers that are strictly smaller than it and that are located between its left and right greater towers, including itself. This is incorrect, as the beauty coefficient of a tower should not include itself.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def solve(n, towers):
    # find left and right greater towers
    left_greater = [0] * n
    right_greater = [0] * n
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and towers[stack[-1]] <= towers[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            left_greater[i] = stack[-1] + 1
        stack.append(i)
    stack = []
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and towers[stack[-1]] <= towers[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            right_greater[i] = stack[-1] - 1
        stack.append(i)

    # calculate beauty coefficients
    beauty = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        beauty[i] = right_greater[i] - left_greater[i]
        if left_greater[i] > 0:
            beauty[i] += beauty[left_greater[i] - 1]
        if right_greater[i] < n - 1:
            beauty[i] += beauty[right_greater[i] + 1]
    return beauty

with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f_in, open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f_out:
