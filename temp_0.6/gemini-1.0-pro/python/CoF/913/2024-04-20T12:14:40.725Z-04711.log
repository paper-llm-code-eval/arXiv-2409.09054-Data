Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `paralele.in` and write to `paralele.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Avem o matrice de dimensiuni $N \cdot M$, cu elemente $0$ și $1$. Numim segment o secvență de cel puțin două valori $1$ aflate una lângă alta, toate pe aceeași linie, sau toate pe aceeași coloană a matricei.

# Cerință

Se cere determinarea numărului de perechi de segmente:

1. aflate pe linii distincte ale matricei;
2. aflate pe coloane distincte ale matricei;

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `paralele.in` conține pe prima linie, separate prin câte un spațiu trei valori naturale, în ordine: $T, N$ și $M$. Dacă $T$ este $1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$, iar dacă $T$ este $2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.
Începând cu linia a doua se află elementele matricei, o linie a matricei pe o linie a fișierului. Elementele de pe aceeași linie se separă prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `paralele.out` conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând valoarea cerută.

The error in the previous solution was that it did not count the pairs of segments that were on the same row and column. To fix this, I have added a check to see if the row and column of the two segments are the same. If they are, then the pair is not counted.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open("paralele.in", "r") as f:
    T, N, M = map(int, f.readline().split())
    mat = []
    for i in range(N):
        mat.append([int(x) for x in f.readline().split()])

if T == 1:
    ans = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(M):
            if mat[i][j] == 1:
                for k in range(j + 1, M):
                    if mat[i][k] == 1 and i != k:
                        ans += 1
    with open("paralele.out", "w") as f:
