Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `imprimanta.in` and write to `imprimanta.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

The issue with the previous solution was that it didn't take into account the fact that the number of points available for printing could be less than the minimum number of points required to print a digit. This caused the solution to incorrectly output a digit that required more points than were available.

Here is a fixed version of the solution:

```python
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Prima cerinta
min_ace = 1000000000000000000
cifra_min_ace = -1
for i in range(10):
    ace = 0
    if i in [0, 1, 4, 7]:
        ace += 3
    if i in [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]:
        ace += 2
    if ace < min_ace and ace <= k:
        min_ace = ace
        cifra_min_ace = i

# A doua cerinta
max_nr = 0
for i in range(9, -1, -1):
    if i in [0, 1, 4, 7]:
        if k >= 3:
            max_nr = max(max_nr, i * 10 ** (k // 3))
            k -= 3
        else:
            break
    elif i in [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]:
        if k >= 2:
            max_nr = max(max_nr, i * 10 ** (k // 2))
            k -= 2
        else:
            break

with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(cifra_min_ace) + '\n')

```

This solution first calculates the minimum number of points required to print each digit. It then iterates through the digits from 9 to 0, and for each digit, it checks if the number of points available is greater than or equal to the minimum number of points required to print the digit. If it is, the solution updates the maximum number that can be printed with the given number of points.
