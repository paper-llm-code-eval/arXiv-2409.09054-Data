Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `balaur.in` and write to `balaur.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

A fost o dată un balaur cu $6$ capete. Într-o zi, Făt-Frumos s-a supărat și i-a tăiat un cap. Peste noapte i-au crescut alte $6$ capete în loc. Pe același gât! A doua zi, Făt-Frumos iar i-a tăiat un cap, dar peste noapte balaurului i-au crescut în loc alte $6$ capete... și tot așa timp de $n$ zile. În cea de a ($n+1$)-a zi, Făt-Frumos s-a plictisit și a plecat acasă!

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de zile, și calculează câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `balaur.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `balaur.out` va conține un singur număr reprezentînd câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 400 \ 000 \ 000$

Example:
`balaur.in`
```
3
```

`balaur.out`
```
15
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open("balaur.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
with open("balaur.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(6 + (6 * (n - 1))))

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
3
```
Expected output:
```
15
```
Found output:
```
18
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The code I provided previously had a bug. It was not taking into account that the initial number of heads is 6. The correct code is:
```python
with open("balaur.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
with open("balaur.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(6 * (n + 1)))
```

The issue with the previous code was that it was multiplying the number of heads by `(n + 1)` instead of `(n - 1)`. The correct code is:
```python
with open("balaur.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
with open("balaur.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(6 * (n - 1) + 6))
