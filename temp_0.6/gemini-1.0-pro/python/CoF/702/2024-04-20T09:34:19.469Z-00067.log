Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `lascoala.in` and write to `lascoala.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Directorul unei școli dorește să premieze la sfârșitul anului școlar pe cei mai buni elevi la învățătură. Pentru acest lucru el are de rezolvat două probleme:

1. Să determine câți elevi vor fi premiați dintre cei $n$ elevi ai școlii. După discuții aprinse cu ceilalți profesori se hotărăște în Consiliul Profesoral ca numărul premianților să fie $n - k$, unde $k$ este cel mai mare număr pătrat perfect mai mic strict decât $n$. De exemplu, pentru $n = 150$, $k$ este $144$ (pentru că $144$ = $12^2$), deci vor fi premiați $150 - 144 = 6$ elevi.
2. Pentru a fi cât mai multă liniște la premiere, în Consiliul Profesoral se ia decizia ca elevii care nu vor fi premiați să fie așezați pe terenul de sport pe rânduri de câte $p$ elevi (unde $p^2 = k$). În acest scop, directorul a numerotat elevii nepremiați de la $1$ la $k$ și a hotărât ca elevii să fie așezați în ordinea descrescătoare a numerelor asociate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de elevi din școală și calculează numărul de elevi premiați precum și modul de așezare a elevilor nepremiați.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `lascoala.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `lascoala.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul de elevi premiați, iar pe următoarele linii așezarea elevilor nepremiați.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 700$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import math

with open('lascoala.in') as fin, open('lascoala.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    fout.write(str(n - k) + '\n')
    for i in range(k, 0, -p):
        for j in range(i, i - p, -1):
            fout.write(str(j) + ' ')
        fout.write('\n')
```
---------- user ----------


Program exited with code 1.
stdout:
```

```
stderr:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 7, in <module>
    for i in range(k, 0, -p):
                          ^
NameError: name 'p' is not defined

```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.
Implement a solution to fix the program

The program exited with code 1 because the variable `p` was not defined. To fix this, we need to define `p` as the square root of `k`. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

with open('lascoala.in') as fin, open('lascoala.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    p = int(math.sqrt(k))
    fout.write(str(n - k) + '\n')
    for i in range(k, 0, -p):
        for j in range(i, i - p, -1):
            fout.write(str(j) + ' ')
        fout.write('\n')
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result has an extra space at the end of each line. This is because the code is writing a space after the last element on each line.

To fix this, we can simply remove the space after the last element on each line. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

with open('lascoala.in') as fin, open('lascoala.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    p = int(math.sqrt(k))
    fout.write(str(n - k) + '\n')
    for i in range(k, 0, -p):
        for j in range(i, i - p, -1):
            fout.write(str(j))

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result has no spaces between the numbers on each line. This is because the code is writing the numbers on each line without a space in between.

To fix this, we can simply add a space between the numbers on each line. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

with open('lascoala.in') as fin, open('lascoala.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    p = int(math.sqrt(k))
    fout.write(str(n - k) + '\n')

        for j in range(i, i - p, -1):
            fout.write(str(j) + ' ')
