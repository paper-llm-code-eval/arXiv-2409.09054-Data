Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `reactivi.in` and write to `reactivi.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Într-un laborator de analize chimice se utilizează $N$ reactivi. Se știe că, pentru a evita accidentele sau deprecierea reactivilor, aceștia trebuie să fie stocați în condiții de mediu speciale. Mai exact, pentru fiecare reactiv $x$, se precizează intervalul de temperatură $[min_x, max_x]$ în care trebuie să se încadreze temperatura de stocare a acestuia.

Reactivii vor fi plasați în frigidere. Orice frigider are un dispozitiv cu ajutorul căruia putem stabili temperatura (constantă) care va fi in interiorul acelui frigider (exprimată într-un număr întreg de grade Celsius).

# Cerință
Scrieți un program care să determine numărul minim de frigidere necesare pentru stocarea reactivilor chimici.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `reactivi.in` conține:
- pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, care reprezintă numărul de reactivi;
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află $min$ și $max$, două numere întregi separate printr-un spațiu; numerele de pe linia $x+1$ din fișier reprezintă temperatura minimă, respectiv temperatura maximă de stocare a reactivului $x$.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `reactivi.out` va conține o singură linie pe care este scris numărul minim de frigidere necesar.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 8\ 000$
- $-100 \leq min_x \leq max_x \leq 100$ (numere întregi, reprezentând grade Celsius), pentru orice $x$ de la $1$ la $N$
- Un frigider poate conține un număr nelimitat de reactivi.

        while j < n and reactivi[j][0] <= max_temp:
            max_temp = max(max_temp, reactivi[j][1])
            j += 1

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not correctly handle the case when multiple reactives could be stored in the same fridge.
Here is a corrected version of the solution:
```python
with open('reactivi.in', 'r') as f_in, open('reactivi.out', 'w') as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline().strip())
    reactivi = [list(map(int, f_in.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    reactivi.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    i = 0
    nr_frigidere = 0
    while i < n:
        min_temp = reactivi[i][0]
        max_temp = reactivi[i][1]
        j = i + 1
        while j < n and reactivi[j][0] <= max_temp:
            min_temp = min(min_temp, reactivi[j][0])
            max_temp = max(max_temp, reactivi[j][1])
            j += 1
        nr_frigidere += 1
        i = j

    f_out.write(str(nr_frigidere))
```
This solution correctly handles the case when multiple reactives can be stored in the same fridge by updating the minimum and maximum temperatures of the current fridge accordingly.
