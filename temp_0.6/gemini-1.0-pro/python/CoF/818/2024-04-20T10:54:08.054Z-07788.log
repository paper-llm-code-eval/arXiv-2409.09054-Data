Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `roata.in` and write to `roata.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

The bug in the previous solution was that it did not correctly update the `current_cabin` variable when a client exited the ride. This caused the exit cabin numbers to be incorrect.

    n = int(f.readline())

# Create a queue to store the clients in the order they will exit

# Create a list to store the order in which the clients will exit

# Create a list to store the cabin numbers from which the clients will exit

# Initialize the current cabin number to 1

# Initialize the number of rotations completed to 0

# Process each client

    # Add the client to the queue

    # Update the number of rotations completed

        # Add the client's exit order to the list

        # Calculate the cabin number from which the client will exit
        exit_cabin = (current_cabin + rotations_completed - 1) % n + 1
