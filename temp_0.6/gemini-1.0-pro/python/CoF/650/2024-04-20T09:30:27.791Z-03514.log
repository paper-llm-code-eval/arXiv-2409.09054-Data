Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `yinyang.in` and write to `yinyang.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă o matrice $A$ cu $N$ linii și $M$ coloane, cu valori cuprinse între $1$ și $N \cdot M$ inclusiv, nu neapărat distincte. O **operație** constă în selectarea a două linii sau două coloane consecutive și interschimbarea acestora (swap). O matrice **yin-yang** este o matrice în care $A[i][j] \geq A[i][j – 1]$, pentru orice pereche $(i, j)$ cu $1 \leq i \leq N$ și $2 \leq j \leq M$ și $A[i][j] \geq A[i – 1][j]$, pentru orice pereche $(i, j)$ cu $2 \leq i \leq N$ și $1 \leq j \leq M$.

# Cerinţă

Să se determine numărul minim de operații necesare pentru a transforma matricea dată într-o matrice yin-yang.

# Date de intrare

În fișierul de intrare `yinyang.in` se află scrise pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $M$, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află câte $M$ numere naturale, reprezentând elementele matricei date $A$. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul `yinyang.out` se va scrie numărul minim de operații cerut sau $-1$ dacă nu există soluție.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N, M \leq 100$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $9$ puncte: $1 \leq N, M \leq 5$;
- Pentru alte teste în valoare de $18$ puncte: $N = 1$;
- Pentru alte teste în valoare de $36$ de puncte elementele din matrice sunt **DISTINCTE**.

The program exited with code 137 because there was a segmentation fault. This is usually caused by accessing memory that is out of bounds. In this case, the most likely cause is that the `mn_row` or `mn_col` variables were not initialized to -1, and thus, when the program tried to access `a[mn_row - 1]` or `a[mn_col - 1]`, it accessed memory that was out of bounds.
