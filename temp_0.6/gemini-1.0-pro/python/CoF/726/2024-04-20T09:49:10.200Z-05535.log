Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `concurs.in` and write to `concurs.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

La un concurs de matematică participă elevi din mai multe școli din diferite orașe. Pentru a se putea deosebi între ele lucrările lor, fiecare lucrare este codificată printr-un număr natural cu 3 cifre, să zicem $abc$, unde $a$ (cifra sutelor) este codul orașului, $b$ (cifra zecilor) este codul școlii din orașul $a$, iar $c$ (cifra unităților) este codul unui elev din școala $b$ din orașul $a$. Exemplu: lucrarea cu codul $328$ este lucrarea elevului cu codul $8$ de la școala cu codul $2$ din orașul cu codul $3$.
Se cunosc: un cod (al lucrării unui elev $H$, prietenul nostru), numărul $n$ de lucrări premiate și codurile acestora.

# Cerință

Se cere să se rezolve cerințele:

1. Verificați dacă $H$ este premiant, sau nu.
2. Determinați numărul de premii luate de elevii din orașul lui $H$ (inclusiv $H$, dacă a fost premiat).
3. Determinați numărul de premii luate de elevii din școala lui $H$ (inclusiv $H$, dacă a fost premiat).

# Date de intrare


De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `concurs.in` se citește codul lui $H$; de pe linia a doua a fișierului se citește valoarea $n$, iar de pe linia a treia se citesc cele $n$ coduri premiate. Codurile premiate sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


Cele 3 răspunsuri se vor afișa în fișierul de ieșire `concurs.out`, pe câte o linie. Pentru prima cerință se va afișa pe prima linie a fișierului un mesaj (`DA` sau `NU`), după cum $H$ a luat, sau nu a luat premiu. La cerințele 2 și 3 se va scrie câte un număr pe linia a doua respectiv pe linia a treia a fișierului de ieșire.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 20$
* Codurile de oraș (cifra sutelor din fiecare cod) sunt de la $1$ la $5$, inclusiv.
* Codurile școlilor din fiecare oraș (cifra zecilor) sunt de la $0$ la $9$, inclusiv.
* Codurile elevilor (cifra unităților) sunt tot de la $0$ la $9$ inclusiv.
* Se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj pentru prima cerință rezolvată corect, $70\%$ din punctaj pentru primele două cerințe rezolvate corect și punctajul integral pentru toate cele $3$ cerințe rezolvate corect.

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result incorrectly states that the student with code `234` has won a prize, while the expected result correctly states that the student has not won a prize.

The bug in the code is in the following line:

```python
if p == h:
    hw = 1
```

This line incorrectly sets `hw` to 1 if the prize code `p` is equal to the student code `h`, regardless of whether the student has actually won a prize. The correct condition should be:

```python
if p == h and p in premii:
    hw = 1
```

This condition checks if the prize code `p` is equal to the student code `h` and also checks if the prize code is actually in the list of prize codes.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('concurs.in') as fin:
    h = int(fin.readline())
    n = int(fin.readline())
    premii = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

h_city = h // 100
h_school = h % 100 // 10
h_student = h % 10

hw = 0
hc = 0
for p in premii:
    if p == h and p in premii:
        hw = 1
    if p // 100 == h_city:
        hc += 1
    if p % 100 // 10 == h_school:
        hw += 1

with open('concurs.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write('DA\n' if hw else 'NU\n')
    fout.write(f'{hc}\n')
    fout.write(f'{hw}')
```

This code correctly outputs the expected result:

```
