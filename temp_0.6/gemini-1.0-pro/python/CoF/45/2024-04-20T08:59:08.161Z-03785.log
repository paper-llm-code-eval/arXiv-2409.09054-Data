Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `iepuri.in` and write to `iepuri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

The issue with the previous solution is that it did not take into account the case when a rabbit eats the same number of carrots as its superior. To fix this, we need to modify the loop that iterates over the possible number of carrots that a rabbit can eat:
```python
for i in range(eaten[node], min(eaten[node] + K + 1, k + 1)):
```
to:
```python
for i in range(eaten[node], min(eaten[node] + K + 1, k + 2)):
```

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def dfs(node, eaten):
    cnt = 1
    for child in graph[node]:
        for i in range(eaten[node], min(eaten[node] + K + 1, k + 2)):
            if dfs(child, eaten + [(i)]) == -1:
                return -1
            cnt = (cnt * res[child]) % mod
    return cnt

    for _ in range(n - 1):
