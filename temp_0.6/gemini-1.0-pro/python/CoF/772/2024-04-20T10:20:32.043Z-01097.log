Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `nr.in` and write to `nr.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se generează un şir de numere naturale ai cărui primi termeni sunt, în această ordine: 

$1$, $2$, $3$, $5$, $8$, $3$, $1$, $4$, $5$, $9$, $4$, $3$, $7$, $0$, $7$, $7$, $4$,...	 

# Cerință

Deduceţi regula după care sunt generaţi termenii şirului şi scrieţi un program care să citească numerele naturale $n$, $k$ şi $p$ şi care să determine:

1.	suma tuturor numerelor prime aflate printre primii $n$ termeni ai şirului din enunţ; 
2.	numărul de apariţii ale cifrei $k$ printre primii $n$ termeni ai şirului din enunţ;
3.	cel de-al $p$-lea termen al şirului din enunţ.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul `nr.in` conţine o singură linie pe care sunt scrise trei numere naturale $n$, $k$ şi $p$, separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `nr.out` va conţine $3$ linii: 

1. pe prima linie, un număr natural reprezentând suma tuturor numerelor prime aflate printre primii $n$ termeni ai şirului din enunţ  
2. pe a doua linie, numărul de apariţii ale cifrei $k$ printre primii $n$ termeni ai şirului din enunţ
3. pe a treia linie se va afişa cel de-al $p$-lea termen al şirului din enunţ



# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $0 \leq k \leq 9$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei 1) se acordă 40% din punctaj, pentru cerinţa 2) 20% din punctaj şi pentru cerinţa 3) 40% din punctaj.
* Pentru teste în valoare de $50$ de puncte, $p \leq 10^7$;

The issue with the previous solution is that it calculates the sum of all prime numbers in the first `n` terms of the sequence, instead of the sum of all prime numbers in the first `n` terms of the sequence that are less than `n`. This is because the `nr` list contains the first `p` terms of the sequence, not the first `n` terms.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
with open('nr.in', 'r') as fin, open('nr.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, k, p = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    nr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
    prime = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    count_k = 0
    sum_prime = 0
    while len(nr) < p:
        next_nr = nr[-1] + nr[-2] - nr[-3]
        if next_nr % 2 == 0 and next_nr not in nr:
            nr.append(next_nr)
