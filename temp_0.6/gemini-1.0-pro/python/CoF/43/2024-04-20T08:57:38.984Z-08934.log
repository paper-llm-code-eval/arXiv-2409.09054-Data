Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cerc.in` and write to `cerc.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se desenează $n$ cercuri distincte în plan, numerotate cu numerele de la $1$ la $n$. Pentru fiecare cerc $k$ ($k \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$) se cunosc: raza cercului, $r_k$, şi coodonatele ($x_k, y_k$) ale centrului cercului, coordonate referitoare la reperul cartezian $xOy$ cu originea în punctul $O$ din plan. Din punctul $O$, se desenează $m$ drepte distincte, astfel încât pentru fiecare dreaptă, dintre cele $m$ desenate, să existe cel puţin un cerc, dintre cele $n$, al cărui centru să fie situat pe această dreaptă şi pentru fiecare cerc desenat, să existe o singură dreaptă, dintre cele $m$ desenate, care să treacă prin centrul lui.  

# Cerinţă
Să se scrie un program care să se determine:
a) numărul $m$ de drepte distincte; 
b) cel mai mare număr $q$ de cercuri, dintre cele $n$, exterioare două câte două, ale căror centre sunt situate pe o aceeaşi dreaptă care trece prin punctul $O$, dintre cele $m$ desenate; 
c) numărul $p$ al dreptelor distincte, dintre cele $m$ desenate, pe care sunt situate centrele a câte $q$ cercuri, dintre cele $n$, exterioare două câte două.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `cerc.in`  conţine:
$n$
$x_1\ y_1\ r_1$
...
$x_n\ y_n\ r_n$	
- pe prima linie, o valoare naturală nenulă $n$, reprezentând numărul de cercuri
- următoarele $n$ linii conţin câte trei numere naturale nenule, separate prin câte un spaţiu, care reprezintă coordonatele centrului $(x_1, y_1)$ şi raza $r_1$ ale primului cerc, ..., coordonatele centrului $(x_n, y_n)$ şi raza $r_n$ ale celui de-al $n$-lea cerc 

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `cerc.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care se vor scrie cele trei numere naturale $m$, $q$ şi $p$, separate prin câte un spaţiu. 

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ n ≤ 2\ 000$
* $1 ≤ x_1, x_2, ..., x_n ≤ 1\ 000$ ; $1 ≤ y_1, y_2, ..., y_n ≤ 1\ 000$ ; $1 ≤ r_1, r_2, ..., r_n ≤ 70$
* dacă două cercuri, dintre cele $n$, au centrele în acelaşi punct din plan, atunci razele lor sunt distincte
* două cercuri sunt exterioare dacă nu au niciun punct comun şi nici interioarele lor nu au puncte comune
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă $20%$ din punctaj, pentru cerinţa b) $50%$ din punctaj şi pentru cerinţa c) $30%$ din punctaj.

The issue with the previous solution was that it counted the number of points where the circles intersect, not the number of lines that pass through the centers of the circles. To fix this, we can use a dictionary to store the number of circles that intersect each point. Then, we can iterate over the points and find the point with the maximum number of intersecting circles. The number of lines that pass through this point is equal to the maximum number of circles that intersect it.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
import sys
with open('cerc.in') as fin, open('cerc.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    cercuri = [(int(x), int(y), int(r)) for x, y, r in [line.split() for line in fin]]
    puncte = {}
    for x, y, r in cercuri:
        if (x, y) not in puncte:
            puncte[(x, y)] = 0
        puncte[(x, y)] += 1
    m = len(puncte)
    q = 0
    p = 0
    for punct in puncte:
        cercuri_pe_dreapta = puncte[punct]
        if cercuri_pe_dreapta > q:
            q = cercuri_pe_dreapta
