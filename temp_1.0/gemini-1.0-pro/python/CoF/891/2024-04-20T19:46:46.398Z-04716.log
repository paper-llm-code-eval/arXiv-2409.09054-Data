Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `fadema.in` and write to `fadema.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Corina a cumpărat de la magazin un material din pânză colorată, de formă dreptunghiulară pentru a decupa din el o față de masă pentru masa din bucătărie. Fiindcă este pasionată de șah, Corina a ales un material format din $n \times m$ pătrate de aceeași dimensiune colorate cu alb sau negru. Pătratele sunt lipite și sunt dispuse pe linii și coloane paralele cu laturile dreptunghiului din pânză care a fost cumpărat. Două pătrate se numesc vecine dacă au în comun o latură.

Materialul din pânză nu respectă neapărat structura unei table de șah, adică pătratele vecine pe aceeași linie sau pe aceeași coloană nu sunt în mod necesar colorate în mod alternativ.

Corina își propune prin urmare să decupeze un dreptunghi cu un număr maxim de pătrate, paralel cu laturile dreptunghiului din pânză care a fost cumpărat, care să respecte alternanța culorilor pe o tablă de șah.

# Cerință
Să se determine numărul maxim de pătrate întregi ale unui dreptunghi cu laturile paralele cu cele ale materialului cumpărat, care poate fi decupat astfel încât să nu existe două pătrate vecine având aceeași culoare.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul `fadema.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $n$ și $m$ reprezentând numărul de linii, respectiv numărul de coloane ale materialului din pânză care a fost cumpărat.
Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii se află câte $m$ cifre `0` sau `1` despărțite prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând culorile pătratelor materialului. Cifra `0` codifică culoarea albă, iar cifra `1` codifică culoarea neagră.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul `fadema.out` va conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural $A$, reprezentând numărul maxim de pătrate ale unui dreptunghi care poate fi decupat astfel încât să respecte cerința din enunț. Dacă nu există dreptunghiuri cu cel puțin două pătrate având culori alternante, se va scrie valoarea $1$.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $2 \leq N \leq 1\ 000$
- $2 \leq M \leq 1\ 000$
- Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței respectând restricțiile problemei se acordă 90 de puncte.
- Pentru rezultate corecte respectând restricțiile problemei și $n, m \leq 100$ se acordă 20 de puncte.
- Pentru rezultate corecte respectând restricțiile problemei și $n, m \leq 200$ se acordă 40 de puncte.
- Pentru rezultate corecte respectând restricțiile problemei și $n, m \leq 400$ se acordă 65 de puncte.
- Din oficiu se acordă 10 puncte.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not correctly count the area of the rectangle. Specifically, it counted the area twice.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
with open('fadema.in') as fin:
    n, m = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    grid = [[int(c) for c in line.split()] for line in fin]

max_area = 1

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if i > 0 and j > 0 and grid[i][j] == grid[i - 1][j - 1]:
            continue
        curr_area = 1
        for k in range(i + 1, n):
