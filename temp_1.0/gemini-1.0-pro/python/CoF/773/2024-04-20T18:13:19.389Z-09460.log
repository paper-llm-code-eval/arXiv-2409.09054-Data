Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `schi.in` and write to `schi.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În tabără la munte s-a organizat un concurs de schi fond. Toţi concurenţii au parcurs aceeaşi distanţă şi au luat startul în acelaşi moment. La start s-au aliniat $n$ concurenţi iar pentru fiecare concurent se cunoaşte timpul în care a parcurs traseul, exprimat în minute şi secunde.

Se cunoaşte de asemenea ora, minutul şi secunda la care s-a dat startul.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine ora, minutul şi secunda în care ajunge la linia de sosire primul concurent şi ora, minutul şi secunda în care ajunge la linia de sosire ultimul concurent. 


# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `schi.in` conţine:

* pe prima linie $3$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând ora, minutul şi secunda la care s-a dat startul
* pe a doua linie numărul natural $n$ reprezentând numărul concurenţilor
* Următoarele $n$ linii vor conţine câte două numere naturale $m$ şi $s$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând timpul realizat de fiecare concurent, exprimat în minute şi secunde


# Date de ieșire


În fişierul `schi.out` se vor scrie două linii:

* pe prima linie se vor scrie trei numere naturale, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând ora, minutul şi secunda sosirii concurentului care a ajuns primul la linia de sosire
* pe a doua linie se vor scrie trei numere naturale, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând ora, minutul şi secunda sosirii concurentului care a ajuns ultimul la linia de sosire



# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100$;
* Startul se dă între orele 8:00 și 20:00;
* $0 \le m < 60$;
* $0 \le s < 60$.

The error was caused by a misunderstanding of the `map` function. The `map` function returns an iterator of the results, not a list. To fix the program, I need to convert the iterator to a list using the `list` function.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('schi.in', 'r') as f:
    h, m, s = map(int, f.readline().split())
    n = int(f.readline())
    times = [map(int, l.split()) for l in f.readlines()]

# Add the start time to each competitor's time
times = [(h+t[0], m+t[1], s+t[2]) for t in list(times)]

# Sort the competitors by time
times.sort()

# Write the first and last competitor's finishing times to the output file
with open('schi.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, times[0])) + '\n')
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, times[-1])))

The error is the same as before, caused by a misunderstanding of the `map` function. The `map` function returns an iterator of the results, not a list. To fix the program, I need to convert the iterator to a list using the `list` function.

```python

times = [(h+t[0], m+t[1], s+t[2]) for t in list(times)]

# Sort the competitors by time
times.sort()

# Write the first and last competitor's finishing times to the output file
with open('schi.out', 'w') as f:

The error is caused by the fact that the `times` list is a list of lists, and I am trying to access the elements of the inner lists using the `t[0]`, `t[1]`, and `t[2]` syntax. This is incorrect, as the correct syntax to access the elements of a list of lists is `t[0][0]`, `t[0][1]`, and `t[0][2]`.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('schi.in', 'r') as f:
    h, m, s = map(int, f.readline().split())
    n = int(f.readline())
    times = [list(map(int, l.split())) for l in f.readlines()]

# Add the start time to each competitor's time
times = [(h+t[0], m+t[1], s+t[2]) for t in times]

# Sort the competitors by time
times.sort()

# Write the first and last competitor's finishing times to the output file
with open('schi.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, times[0])) + '\n')
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, times[-1])))

The error is most likely caused by the fact that the `times` list is empty. This can happen if the input file is empty or if the input file does not contain the correct number of lines.

To fix the program, I need to add a check to make sure that the `times` list is not empty before trying to access its elements.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('schi.in', 'r') as f:
    h, m, s = map(int, f.readline().split())
    n = int(f.readline())
    times = [list(map(int, l.split())) for l in f.readlines()]

# Check if the times list is empty
if not times:
    print("The input file is empty or does not contain the correct number of lines.")
    exit(1)

# Add the start time to each competitor's time
times = [(h+t[0], m+t[1], s+t[2]) for t in times]

# Sort the competitors by time
times.sort()

# Write the first and last competitor's finishing times to the output file
with open('schi.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, times[0])) + '\n')
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, times[-1])))
