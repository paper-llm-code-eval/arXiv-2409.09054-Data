Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `ucif.in` and write to `ucif.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Fie $n$ un număr natural și $s = 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + \dots + n^n$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să afișeze ultima cifră a lui $s$.

# Date de intrare


De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `ucif.in` se citește numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire


Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `ucif.out` se va afișa numai ultima cifră a lui $s$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$

Example:
`ucif.in`
```
3
```

`ucif.out`
```
2
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
3
```
Expected output:
```
2
```
Found output:
```
3
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.

The mistake in my code was that I took the last digit, but I should have taken the last digit of the summation of powers.
Here is the corrected solution:

```python
n = int(open("ucif.in").read())
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum += i ** i
print(sum % 10)
```

Expected program to write result to `ucif.out` and read from `ucif.in`.
Do not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.
