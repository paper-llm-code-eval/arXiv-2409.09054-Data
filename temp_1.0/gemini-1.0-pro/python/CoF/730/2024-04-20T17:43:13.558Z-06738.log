Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `joc.in` and write to `joc.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Jocul “Nu te supăra, frate!” se joacă de către doi jucatori. Pe o pistă circulară cu $n$ căsuţe numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, în ordinea dată de sensul acelor de ceasornic, se află înscrise valorile $0, 1$ şi $10$. Cei doi jucători vor avea fiecare câte un pion şi vor porni pe rând, din căsuţa $1$. Începe jucătorul $1$. Fiecare jucător va muta pionul său conform cu valoarea obţinută prin aruncarea zarului, cumulând sau pierzând puncte în funcţie de căsuţa în care ajunge. Fiecare jucător citeşte valoarea zarului când îi vine rândul.

Jocul are urmatoarele reguli:
1. Câştigătorul poate fi:
	- jucătorul care ajunge primul din nou în căsuţa cu numărul $1$, indiferent de punctaj (exceptând cazul în care are punctaj $0$)
	- în cazul în care se termină şirul aruncărilor cu zarul, înseamnă că jucătorii s-au plictisit şi câştigă cel care a cumulat mai multe puncte, iar dacă au punctaje egale câştigă cel care se află în căsuţa cu număr de ordine mai mare.
2. După aruncarea zarului, jucătorul mută pionul cu atâtea căsuţe cât indică valoarea zarului, în ordinea acelor de ceasornic, începând numărătoarea cu căsuţa următoare poziţiei pe care se află. Prima căsuţă nu conţine valoarea $0$ (zero).
3. După mutare pot apare următoarele situaţii:
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $0$ (zero) – jucătorul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele acumulate şi reia jocul din pozitia $1$
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $10$ – primeşte un bonus de $10$ puncte
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $1$ – primeşte $1$ punct
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă în care se află celălalt pion (cu excepţia căsuţei $1$, când câştigă) – jucătorul care ajunge ultimul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele şi reia jocul de la căsuţa $1$.

# Cerință

Determinaţi jucătorul câştigător, poziţiile fiecărui jucător pe cerc şi punctajul fiecărui jucător.

# Date de intrare

În fişierul `joc.in` se dau:
- Pe prima linie numărul $n$ al casutelor din cerc.
- Linia a doua conţine o succesiune de $n$ valori ($0, 1$ sau $10$), separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând valoarea fiecărei căsuţe.
- Linia a treia conţine numărul de aruncări cu zarul
- Linia a patra conţine o succesiune de valori întregi cuprinse între $1$ şi $6$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând aruncarea cu zarul. 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `joc.out` va conţine $3$ linii cu următoarele informaţii:
- pe prima linie: jucătorul câştigător
- pe a doua linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $1$.
- pe a treia linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $2$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $7 \leq n \leq 100$;

The bug in the previous solution was that it did not correctly handle the case where both players land on the same cell. In this case, the player who landed on the cell second should be penalized, but the previous solution penalized the player who landed on the cell first.

Here is the fixed solution:

        dice_throws = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]
    return n, values, throws, dice_throws

    # Initialize the game state
    players = [{"position": 1, "points": 0} for _ in range(2)]

        for player in range(2):
            # Get the dice roll
            roll = dice_throws[i]

            # Move the player
            players[player]["position"] = (players[player]["position"] + roll - 1) % n + 1

            if values[players[player]["position"] - 1] == 0:

The error in the previous solution was that the `players` variable was not defined in the `write_output` function. To fix this, we can pass the `players` variable as an argument to the `write_output` function.

        dice_throws = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]
    return n, values, throws, dice_throws

        for player in range(2):
            # Get the dice roll
            roll = dice_throws[i]

The error in the previous solution was that the `players` variable was not defined in the `write_output` function, even though it was passed as an argument. To fix this, we need to modify the `write_output` function to accept the `players` variable as an argument.

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The error in the previous solution was that the `players` variable was not defined in the `write_output` function, even though it was passed as an argument. To fix this, we need to modify the `write_output` function to accept the `players` variable as an argument.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
def read_input():
    with open('joc.in', 'r') as f:
        n = int(f.readline())
        values = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]
        throws = int(f.readline())
        dice_throws = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]
    return n, values, throws, dice_throws

def play_game(n, values, throws, dice_throws):
    # Initialize the game state
    players = [{"position": 1, "points": 0} for _ in range(2)]

    # Play the game
    for i in range(throws):
        for player in range(2):
            # Get the dice roll
            roll = dice_throws[i]

            # Move the player
            players[player]["position"] = (players[player]["position"] + roll - 1) % n + 1

            # Apply the effect of the cell
            if values[players[player]["position"] - 1] == 0:
                players[player]["position"] = 1
                players[player]["points"] = 0
            elif values[players[player]["position"] - 1] == 10:
                players[player]["points"] += 10
            elif values[players[player]["position"] - 1] == 1:
                players[player]["points"] += 1
            elif players[player]["position"] == players[1 - player]["position"]:
                players[1 - player]["position"] = 1
                players[1 - player]["points"] = 0

            # Check if the player has won
            if players[player]["position"] == 1 and players[player]["points"] != 0:
                return player + 1

    # Determine the winner based on points or position
    if players[0]["points"] == players[1]["points"]:
        winner = players[0]["position"] > players[1]["position"]
    else:
        winner = players[0]["points"] > players[1]["points"]

    return winner + 1


def write_output(winner, players):
    with open('joc.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(winner) + '\n')
        for player in range(2):
            f.write(str(players[player]["position"]) + ' ' + str(players[player]["points"]) + '\n')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, values, throws, dice_throws = read_input()
    winner = play_game(n, values, throws, dice_throws)
    write_output(winner, players)  # Fix: pass 'players' as an argument
```

This solution should now run without errors and produce the correct output.
