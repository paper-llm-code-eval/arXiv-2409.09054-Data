Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `triang.in` and write to `triang.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

O triangulație a unui poligon convex este o mulțime formată din diagonale ale poligonului care nu se intersectează în interiorul poligonului ci numai în vârfuri și care împart toată suprafața poligonului în triunghiuri.

# Cerință

Fiind dat un poligon cu $n$ vârfuri notate $1, 2, ..., n$ să se genereze toate triangulațiile distincte ale poligonului. Două triangulații sunt distincte dacă diferă prin cel puțin o diagonală.

# Date de intrare


În fișierul text `triang.in` se află pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând valoarea lui $n$.

# Date de ieșire


În fișierul text `triang.out` se vor scrie:

- pe prima linie, numărul de triangulații distincte;
- pe fiecare din următoarele linii codul unei triangulații, în orice ordine. Codul este format cu ajutorul diagonalelor ce compun triangulația. O diagonală va fi precizată prin două numere reprezentând cele două vârfuri care o definesc.
$\text{cod = } \prod {( \min(d_1,d_2)\cdot 137+\max(d_1,d_2) )} \text{ mod } (10^9+7)$, unde $d_1$ și $d_2$ sunt vârfurile unei diagonale din descompunere, produsul făcându-se peste toate diagonalele din descompunere (se consideră $1$ pentru mulțimea vidă).


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 16$
* Se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj doar pentru numărul de triangulații distincte
* Enunțul si restricțiile au fost modificate

The issue is that the code is trying to import the `numpy` library, but it's not installed in the environment. To fix this, we can add a check to see if the library is installed, and if not, install it.
Here is a modified code that should work:

```python
import sys
import os

# Check if numpy is installed
try:
    import numpy as np
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    # If not, install it
    os.system("pip install numpy")
    import numpy as np

def precalc():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as f:
        n = int(next(f))

    return n

def find_diagonals(n, h):
    diagonals = []

    def dfs(l):
        if len(l) == n:
            diagonals.append(l.copy())
            return

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i <= h[-1]:
                l.append(i)
                h.append(i)
                dfs(l)
                h.pop()
                l.pop()

    dfs([])
    return diagonals

def triangulation_code(diagonals):
    return np.prod([137 * min(d[0], d[1]) + max(d[0], d[1]) for d in diagonals]) % (10**9 + 7)

def main():
    n = precalc()
    diagonals = find_diagonals(n, [])

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as out:
        out.write(f"{len(diagonals)}\n")
        for diag in diagonals:
            out.write(f"{triangulation_code(diag)}\n")

The issue is that the code is still trying to import the `numpy` library, even though we have already installed it. To fix this, we can simply move the import statement to the top of the file, before any other code is executed.
