Graniţa nu se trece uşor. Asta pentru că Balaurul Arhirel (mare pasionat de informatică) nu lasă pe nimeni să treacă decât după ce răspunde la nişte întrebări...

În acea ţară există $3$ tipuri de perle normale (le vom nota cu $1$, $2$ şi $3$) şi $3$ tipuri de perle magice (le vom nota cu $A$, $B$ şi $C$). Perlele magice sunt deosebite prin faptul că se pot transforma în alte perle (una sau mai multe, normale sau magice):
- Perla magică de tipul $A$ se poate transforma în orice perlă normală (una singură);
- Perla magică de tipul $B$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $B$, sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una magică de tipul $A$, una normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $A$ şi una magică de tipul $C$;
- Perla magică de tipul $C$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $B$ şi una magică de tipul $C$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $A$.

Ca să rezumăm cele de mai sus putem scrie:
```
A -> 1  | 2     | 3
B -> 2B | 1A3AC
C -> 2  | 3BC   | 12A
```

Balaurul Arhirel ne lasă la început să ne alegem o perlă magică (una singură), iar apoi folosind numai transformările de mai sus trebuie să obţinem un anumit şir de perle normale. Când o perlă magică se transformă, perlele din stânga şi din dreapta ei rămân la fel (şi în aceeaşi ordine). De asemenea ordinea perlelor rezultate din transformare este chiar cea prezentată mai sus.

De exemplu, dacă balaurul ne cere să facem şirul de perle `21132123`, putem alege o perlă magică de tipul $B$ şi următorul şir de transformări: `B -> 2B -> 21A3AC -> 21A3A12A -> 21132123`.

Întrucât Balaurul nu are prea multă răbdare, el nu ne cere decât să spunem dacă se poate sau nu obţine şirul respectiv de perle.

# Cerință

Să se determine pentru fiecare şir de intrare dacă se poate obţine prin transformările de mai sus sau nu (alegând orice primă perlă magică, la fiecare şir).

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `perle.in` are următoarea structură:
* Pe prima linie numărul $N$, reprezentând numărul de şiruri din fişierul de intrare;
* Urmează $N$ linii; a $i$-a linie dintre cele $N$ descrie şirul $i$, printr-o succesiune de numere naturale despărţite de câte un spaţiu. Primul număr reprezintă lungimea şirului $L_i$, iar următoarele $L_i$ numere sunt tipurile de perle normale, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `perle.out` va conţine $N$ linii. Pe linia $i$ se va scrie un singur număr $1$ sau $0$ ($1$ dacă se poate obţine şirul respectiv (al $i$-lea) şi $0$ dacă nu se poate).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq L_i \leq 10 \ 000$, pentru oricare $i$;

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not take into account the fact that the magic pearl can be transformed multiple times. To fix this, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state of the magic pearl.

Here is the fixed solution in python:
```python
with open("perle.in") as fin, open("perle.out", "w") as fout:
    cases = int(fin.readline())
    for _ in range(cases):
        length, *pearls = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        current = [0] * 6
        current[3] = 1
        stack = []
        res = 1
        for pearl in pearls:
            if not current[pearl - 1]:
                if not stack:
                    res = 0
                    break
                else:
                    current = stack.pop()
            if pearl == 1:
                current[0] = 1
            if pearl == 2:
                current[1] = 1
                current[2] = 1
            if pearl == 3:
                current[2] = 1
                current[5] = 1
            stack.append(current.copy())
        fout.write(f"{res}\n")
```
This solution keeps track of the current state of the magic pearl using a stack. For each pearl in the input, it checks if the current state of the magic pearl can produce that pearl. If it can, it updates the current state of the magic pearl and pushes it onto the stack. If it cannot, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no way to produce the current pearl, so it sets the result to 0 and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it pops the top state from the stack and continues.

After processing all of the pearls in the input, it checks if the result is 1. If it is, it means that there is a way to produce the desired sequence of pearls. Otherwise, it means that there is no way to produce the desired sequence of pearls.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly handle the case where the magic pearl is transformed into a pearl of the same type. For example, if the magic pearl is transformed into a pearl of type 1, the current state of the magic pearl should still be able to produce pearls of type 1.

Here is the fixed solution in python:
```python
with open("perle.in") as fin, open("perle.out", "w") as fout:
    cases = int(fin.readline())
    for _ in range(cases):
        length, *pearls = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        current = [0] * 6
        current[3] = 1
        stack = []
        res = 1
        for pearl in pearls:
            if not current[pearl - 1]:
                if not stack:
                    res = 0
                    break
                else:
                    current = stack.pop()
            if pearl == 1:
                current[0] = 1
            if pearl == 2:
                current[1] = 1
                current[2] = 1
            if pearl == 3:
                current[2] = 1
                current[5] = 1
            stack.append(current.copy())
            if current[pearl - 1] == 1:
                stack.append(current.copy())
        fout.write(f"{res}\n")
```
This solution fixes the issue by adding a check to see if the current state of the magic pearl can produce the current pearl. If it can, it pushes the current state of the magic pearl onto the stack twice. This ensures that the magic pearl can be transformed into the same type of pearl multiple times.
