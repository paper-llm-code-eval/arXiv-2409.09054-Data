Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `pinochio.in` and write to `pinochio.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În fiecare zi lucrătoare din săptămână, Pinochio spune câte o minciună datorită căreia nasul acestuia crește cu câte $p$ centimetri pe zi. Sâmbăta și duminica, când vine bunicul Gepeto acasă, pentru a nu-l supăra prea tare, Pinochio reușește să nu spună nici o minciună, ba chiar uitându-se în oglindă observă că în fiecare din aceste zile lungimea nasului său scade cu câte $1$ centimetru pe zi. Când începe o nouă săptămână, rămânând singur acasă Pinochio continuă șirul minciunilor.

# Cerință

Care este dimensiunea nasului lui Pinochio după $k$ zile știind că inițial nasul său măsura $n$ centimetri.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `pinochio.in` se citesc valorile $n$, $p$, $k$, care se găsesc pe prima linie a fișierului și sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


În fișierul de ieșire `pinochio.out` se va afișa pe prima linie un singur număr natural, numărul de centimetri cerut de problemă.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq k \leq 256$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100$;

`pinochio.in`
```

`pinochio.out`

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The mistake that I made when developing the initial approach was that I was reducing the length of the nose by 1 cm even during weekdays. However, as per the problem statement, the length of the nose should only be reduced by 1 cm during weekends.

This issue can be resolved by modifying the code as follows:
```python
if k % 2 == 1:
    k -= 1
k //= 4
```
Where `k //= 4` is the same as `k = k // 4`.

Here is the complete fixed code:
```python
with open('pinochio.in') as fin, open('pinochio.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, p, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    
    if k % 2 == 1:
        k -= 1
    k //= 4
    
    if k % 2 == 0:
        fout.write(str(n - k // 2))
    else:
        fout.write(str(n - k // 2 + p))
```

My apologies, I made a mistake in my previous response. The correct fix is to divide `k` by 4 before checking if `k` is odd or even. Here is the corrected code:

```python
with open('pinochio.in') as fin, open('pinochio.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, p, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    
    k //= 4
    
    if k % 2 == 0:
        fout.write(str(n - k // 2))
    else:
        fout.write(str(n - k // 2 + p))
```

I apologize for the previous mistakes. Here is a correct and efficient solution in Python:

```python
with open('pinochio.in') as fin, open('pinochio.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, p, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    k = (k + 3) // 4
    fout.write(str(n + min(k, 1) * p - k))
```

Explanation:

* `k = (k + 3) // 4`: This line calculates the number of full cycles of 4 days (3 weekdays + 1 weekend) that fit into the given number of days `k`.
* `min(k, 1) * p`: This calculates the additional growth in Pinocchio's nose during the first day of the current cycle (if there is one).
* `- k`: This subtracts the total reduction in Pinocchio's nose during the weekend days.

The final result is the initial length of the nose (`n`) plus the additional growth and minus the total reduction.
