Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `lascoala.in` and write to `lascoala.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Directorul unei școli dorește să premieze la sfârșitul anului școlar pe cei mai buni elevi la învățătură. Pentru acest lucru el are de rezolvat două probleme:

1. Să determine câți elevi vor fi premiați dintre cei $n$ elevi ai școlii. După discuții aprinse cu ceilalți profesori se hotărăște în Consiliul Profesoral ca numărul premianților să fie $n - k$, unde $k$ este cel mai mare număr pătrat perfect mai mic strict decât $n$. De exemplu, pentru $n = 150$, $k$ este $144$ (pentru că $144$ = $12^2$), deci vor fi premiați $150 - 144 = 6$ elevi.
2. Pentru a fi cât mai multă liniște la premiere, în Consiliul Profesoral se ia decizia ca elevii care nu vor fi premiați să fie așezați pe terenul de sport pe rânduri de câte $p$ elevi (unde $p^2 = k$). În acest scop, directorul a numerotat elevii nepremiați de la $1$ la $k$ și a hotărât ca elevii să fie așezați în ordinea descrescătoare a numerelor asociate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de elevi din școală și calculează numărul de elevi premiați precum și modul de așezare a elevilor nepremiați.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `lascoala.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `lascoala.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul de elevi premiați, iar pe următoarele linii așezarea elevilor nepremiați.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 700$;

The error message:
```
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```
indicates that the variable `num_rows` is a float, but the `range` function expects an integer. To fix this, we can use the `math.ceil` function to round `num_rows` up to the nearest integer:

```
num_rows = math.ceil(k / (k // math.sqrt(k)))
```

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    sqrt = int(math.sqrt(n))
    return sqrt * sqrt == n

# read n
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())

# compute k and number of awarded students
k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1))**2
awarded = n - k

# write number of awarded students
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(awarded) + '\n')

# compute number of rows and students per row
num_rows = math.ceil(k / (k // math.sqrt(k)))
num_students_per_row = k // math.sqrt(k)

# write students in rows
for row in range(num_rows):
    for col in range(num_students_per_row):
        student = k - row * num_students_per_row - col
        f.write(str(student) + ' ')

The error message:
```
ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
```
indicates that the file `lascoala.out` has been closed before trying to write to it. To fix this, we can move the `open` statement inside the `with` block, so that the file is automatically closed when we exit the block:

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    sqrt = int(math.sqrt(n))
    return sqrt * sqrt == n

# read n
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())

# compute k and number of awarded students
k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1))**2
awarded = n - k

# write to a file
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(awarded) + '\n')

    # compute number of rows and students per row
    num_rows = math.ceil(k / (k // math.sqrt(k)))
    num_students_per_row = math.ceil(k // math.sqrt(k))

    # write students in rows
    for row in range(num_rows):
        for col in range(num_students_per_row):
            student = k - row * num_students_per_row - col
            f.write(str(student) + ' ')

The difference between the expected and found output is that the found output has an extra space at the end of each line. To fix this, we can use the `rstrip()` method to remove any trailing whitespace from each line before writing it to the file:

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    sqrt = int(math.sqrt(n))
    return sqrt * sqrt == n

# read n
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())

# compute k and number of awarded students
k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1))**2
awarded = n - k

# write to a file
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(awarded) + '\n')

    # compute number of rows and students per row
    num_rows = math.ceil(k / (k // math.sqrt(k)))
    num_students_per_row = math.ceil(k // math.sqrt(k))

    # write students in rows
    for row in range(num_rows):
        for col in range(num_students_per_row):
            student = k - row * num_students_per_row - col
            f.write(str(student) + ' ')
        f.write('\n').rstrip()

The error message:
```
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'rstrip'
```
indicates that we are trying to call the `rstrip()` method on an integer, which is not valid. To fix this, we can convert the integer to a string before calling `rstrip()`:

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    sqrt = int(math.sqrt(n))
    return sqrt * sqrt == n

# read n
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())

# compute k and number of awarded students
k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1))**2
awarded = n - k

# write to a file
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(awarded) + '\n')

    # compute number of rows and students per row
    num_rows = math.ceil(k / (k // math.sqrt(k)))
    num_students_per_row = math.ceil(k // math.sqrt(k))

    # write students in rows
    for row in range(num_rows):
        for col in range(num_students_per_row):
            student = k - row * num_students_per_row - col
            f.write(str(student) + ' ')
