Având mai multe cuburi la dispoziție, Crina și Rareș au hotărât să construiască clădiri prin alipirea a două sau mai multor turnuri. Turnurile au fost obținute prin așezarea cuburilor unul peste celălalt. **Înălțimea unui turn** este dată de numărul de cuburi din care este format. Clădirile construite au fost așezate în linie, una lângă alta formând astfel o stradă, pe care cei doi copii se vor plimba.

~[cladiri.png|width=40em]

Pentru numerotarea clădirilor Crina și Rareș au stabilit următoarele reguli:
* Crina pornește dintr-un capăt al străzii iar Rareș din celălalt capăt al acesteia; fiecare dintre ei traversează strada complet, trecând prin dreptul fiecărei clădiri
* Crina lipește pe fiecare clădire, câte un bilețel pe care scrie înălțimea turnurilor din care aceasta este construită, în ordinea în care ea le vede când trece prin dreptul lor (de exemplu, pentru imaginea de mai sus, Crina va lipi pe prima clădire un bilețel pe care va scrie numărul $3112$ deoarece, primul turn e format din $3$ cuburi, următoarele două turnuri ale acestei clădiri sunt formate din câte un cub iar cel de-al patrulea turn e format din $2$ cuburi);
* Rareș va proceda la fel, dar începe plimbarea din celalalt capăt al străzii. În exemplul din imagine, el va lipi pe prima clădire pe care o întâlnește un bilețel pe care scrie numărul $2121$.

La finalul plimbării, Crina și Rareș își dau seama că există clădiri pe care au lipit amândoi bilețele cu numere identice.

# Cerință

1. Care este înălțimea celui mai înalt turn și care este numărul clădirilor care au în construcția lor un astfel de turn;
2. Care este numărul clădirilor pe care cei doi copii au lipit bilețele cu numere identice;
3. Care este cel mai mic număr de cuburi necesar pentru **a completa** clădirile astfel încât, pe fiecare clădire bilețelul pe care îl va lipi Crina să conțină același număr cu cel pe care îl va lipi Rareș. Cuburile din care a fost construită inițial clădirea nu se pot muta.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `cladiri.in` se va citi de pe prima linie un număr natural $N$, reprezentând numărul clădirilor de pe stradă iar de pe următoarele $N$ linii, câte un număr natural cu toate cifrele nenule, reprezentând numerele scrise de Crina pe bilețele, în ordinea în care au fost lipite de ea pe clădiri.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `cladiri.out` se va scrie pe prima linie două numere naturale despărțite printr-un singur spațiu ce reprezintă, în ordine, valorile cerute la cerința $1$. Pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie un număr natural, mai mare sau egal cu zero reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$ iar pe cea de-a treia linie a fișierului se va scrie un număr natural mai mare sau egal cu zero reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $3$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Fiecare clădire este alcătuită din cel mult $9$ turnuri, iar înălțimea fiecărui turn este exprimată printr-o cifră nenulă.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $20$% din punctajul fiecărui test, pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $40$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $3$ se acordă 40% din punctajul fiecărui test.
* Respectați formatul fișierului de ieșire! Pentru a obține punctajul acordat unei cerințe, trebuie ca răspunsul din fișier să fie corect și scris exact pe linia precizată în enunț.

The error `IndexError: list index out of range` is raised because the length of the `heights_c` list is `n`, and the loop tries to access `heights_c[i]` where `i` can be `n`. To fix this, the loop should be `for j, x in enumerate(heights_c[i][:nr_towers[i]]):`.

Here is the fixed code:
```python

            towers_c[i] += int(x) * 10**j
        for j, x in enumerate(heights_r[i][:nr_towers[i]]):  # Fix: Added `[:nr_towers[i]]` to limit the loop to the number of towers in the building

The error `IndexError: list index out of range` is still being raised, even after adding the `[:nr_towers[i]]` slice to the `heights_c` and `heights_r` lists in the `read_data` function. This means that there is still a case where the index `i` is out of range.

Upon closer inspection, I realized that the error is caused by the fact that the `nr_towers` list contains the number of towers in each building, but the `heights_c` and `heights_r` lists contain the heights of the towers in each building, which may be different from the number of towers.

To fix this, I need to modify the code to read the heights of the towers in each building and store them in separate lists, `heights_c` and `heights_r`. I also need to modify the code to calculate the number of towers in each building based on the heights of the towers.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

def read_data(f):
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    nr_towers = [0] * n
    heights_c = []
    heights_r = []
    for i in range(n):
        line = f.readline().strip()
        heights_c.append(line)
        heights_r.append(line[::-1])
        nr_towers[i] = len(line)
    return n, nr_towers, heights_c, heights_r

def find_max_tower(towers):
    max_tower = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_tower = max(towers[i], max_tower)
    return max_tower

def count_max_towers(towers, max_tower):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if towers[i] == max_tower:
            count += 1
    return count

def count_identical_towers(towers_c, towers_r):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if towers_c[i] == towers_r[i]:
            count += 1
    return count

def min_cubes_to_complete(towers_c, towers_r):
    min_cubes = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if towers_c[i] < towers_r[i]:
            min_cubes += towers_r[i] - towers_c[i]
    return min_cubes

def write_data(f, max_tower, count_max_towers, count_identical_towers, min_cubes):
    f.write(f"{max_tower} {count_max_towers}\n")
    f.write(f"{count_identical_towers}\n")
    f.write(f"{min_cubes}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":

The error `TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'` is raised because the `find_max_tower` function is trying to compare an integer (`max_tower`) with a string (`towers[i]`). This is because the `heights_c` list contains the heights of the towers as strings, but the `find_max_tower` function expects a list of integers.

To fix this, I need to convert the heights of the towers to integers before passing them to the `find_max_tower` function.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

def read_data(f):
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    nr_towers = [0] * n
    heights_c = []
    heights_r = []
    for i in range(n):
        line = f.readline().strip()
        heights_c.append(line)
        heights_r.append(line[::-1])
        nr_towers[i] = len(line)
    return n, nr_towers, heights_c, heights_r

def find_max_tower(towers):
    max_tower = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_tower = max(max_tower, int(towers[i]))
    return max_tower

def count_max_towers(towers, max_tower):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if int(towers[i]) == max_tower:
            count += 1
    return count

def count_identical_towers(towers_c, towers_r):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if towers_c[i] == towers_r[i]:
            count += 1
    return count

def min_cubes_to_complete(towers_c, towers_r):
    min_cubes = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if int(towers_c[i]) < int(towers_r[i]):
            min_cubes += int(towers_r[i]) - int(towers_c[i])
    return min_cubes

The expected output is:

```
7 3
2
8
```

The found output is:

```
42422 1
2
909
```

The differences between the expected and found output are:

* The first line of the expected output is `7 3`, but the first line of the found output is `42422 1`.
* The second line of the expected output is `2`, but the second line of the found output is also `2`.
* The third line of the expected output is `8`, but the third line of the found output is `909`.

The first difference is because the found output incorrectly reports the maximum tower height as `42422` when it should be `7`. This is because the `find_max_tower` function is not correctly converting the heights of the towers to integers before comparing them.

The third difference is because the `min_cubes_to_complete` function is not correctly calculating the minimum number of cubes needed to complete the towers.

The expected output is:

```
7 3
2
8
```

The found output is:

```
42422 1
2
22176
```

The differences between the expected and found output are:

* The first line of the expected output is `7 3`, but the first line of the found output is `42422 1`.
* The second line of the expected output is `2`, but the second line of the found output is also `2`.
* The third line of the expected output is `8`, but the third line of the found output is `22176`.

The first difference is because the found output incorrectly reports the maximum tower height as `42422` when it should be `7`. This is because the `find_max_tower` function is not correctly converting the heights of the towers to integers before comparing them.

The third difference is because the `min_cubes_to_complete` function is not correctly calculating the minimum number of cubes needed to complete the towers.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

def read_data(f):
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    nr_towers = [0] * n
    heights_c = []
    heights_r = []
    for i in range(n):
        line = f.readline().strip()
        heights_c.append(line)
        heights_r.append(line[::-1])
        nr_towers[i] = len(line)
    return n, nr_towers, heights_c, heights_r

def find_max_tower(towers):
    max_tower = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_tower = max(max_tower, int(towers[i]))
    return max_tower

def count_max_towers(towers, max_tower):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if int(towers[i]) == max_tower:
            count += 1
    return count

def count_identical_towers(towers_c, towers_r):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if towers_c[i] == towers_r[i]:
            count += 1
    return count

def min_cubes_to_complete(towers_c, towers_r):
    min_cubes = 0
    for i in range(n):
        min_cubes += abs(int(towers_r[i]) - int(towers_c[i]))
    return min_cubes

def write_data(f, max_tower, count_max_towers, count_identical_towers, min_cubes):
    f.write(f"{max_tower} {count_max_towers}\n")
    f.write(f"{count_identical_towers}\n")
    f.write(f"{min_cubes}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("cladiri.in", "r") as f_in, open("cladiri.out", "w") as f_out:
        n, nr_towers, heights_c, heights_r = read_data(f_in)
        max_tower = find_max_tower(heights_c)
        count_max_towers = count_max_towers(heights_c, max_tower)
        count_identical_towers = count_identical_towers(heights_c, heights_r)

        write_data(f_out, max_tower, count_max_towers, count_identical_towers, min_cubes)
