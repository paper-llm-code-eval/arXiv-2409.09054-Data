Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `test.in` and write to `test.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Georgel vrea să-i testeze cunoștințele de matematică lui Săndel. Pentru aceasta, îi propune lui Săndel două numere naturale $a$ și $b$. Cu prima cifră a numărului $a$, plasată în locul primei cifre a numărului $b$ se formează un nou număr. Un alt număr se formează cu prima cifră a numărului $a$ plasată în locul ultimei cifre a numărului $b$. Se obțin două noi numere cu a doua cifră a numărului $a$ plasată în locul primei cifre a numărului $b$, respectiv în locul ultimei cifre a numărului $b$. Se continuă formarea și altor numere după aceleași reguli, până când se epuizează cifrele numărului $a$ (dacă numărul $a$ are $3$ cifre, atunci se vor forma $6$ numere).

# Cerință

Cunoscând cele două numere $a$ și $b$, Săndel va trebui să găsească cel mai mare număr prim format conform regulii de mai sus, știind că se iau în calcul pentru această determinare și valorile inițiale ale numerelor $a$ și $b$. În cazul în care nu există niciun număr prim, conform cerințelor de mai sus, se va afișa cel mai mare număr care se poate forma, știind că se iau în calcul și valorile inițiale ale numerelor $a$ și $b$.

# Date de intrare

De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `test.in` se citesc cele două numere $a$ și $b$, în această ordine.


# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `test.out` se va afișa numărul cerut.


# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq a, b \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000$

Example:
`test.in`
```
19 913
```

`test.out`
```
919
```

The bug in the previous solution was that it did not consider the case where the rearranged number was greater than 1000000. To fix this, I have added a check to make sure that the rearranged number is less than or equal to 1000000. If the rearranged number is greater than 1000000, then the solution simply returns the largest number in the list of rearrangements.
