Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `vecini.in` and write to `vecini.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră matricea $A$ ale cărei elemente pot avea doar valorile $0$ sau $1$ și în care numerotarea liniilor și numerotarea coloanelor începe de la $1$. Pentru un element oarecare al matricei, definim noțiunea de vecin ca fiind acele elementele din matrice aflate în imediata sa apropiere pe una dintre direcțiile orizontală, verticală sau pe cele două diagonale (vezi figura de mai jos în care s-au marcat cu $x$ vecinii elementului marcat cu $o$). Un vecin bun al elementului $A_{ij}$ este un vecin care are aceeași valoare cu $A_{ij}$.

~[vecini.png]

# Cerință

Dându-se matricea $A$, să se determine numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei precum și numărul de elemente care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `vecini.in` conține pe prima linie trei valori naturale $m \ n \ k$ reprezentând numărul de linii, numărul de coloane și respectiv numărul de valori egale cu $1$ din matricea $A$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii se află două valori $i$ si $j$ cu semnificația $A_{ij}$ este egal cu $1$. Aceste valori sunt date in ordinea parcurgerii matricei pe linii de la linia $1$ la linia $m$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vecini.out` va conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate printr-un singur spațiu: $x$ va reprezenta numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei date, iar $y$ va reprezenta numărul de elemente din matricea dată care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m,n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq k \leq n \cdot m / 2+1$;
* Pentru $30$% dintre teste $2 \leq m,n \leq 200$;

The issue with my previous solution is that it's not correctly handling the edge cases. When checking for neighbors, it should also check if the neighbor is within the bounds of the matrix. Here is the corrected solution in Python:
```python
with open('vecini.in', 'rt') as fin, open('vecini.out', 'wt') as fout:
    H, W, K = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    mat = [[False] * (W + 2) for x in range(H + 2)]
    for x in range(H + 2):
        mat[x][0] = mat[x][W + 1] = True
    for x in range(1, W + 1):
        mat[0][x] = mat[H + 1][x] = True
    for arg in range(K):
        x, y = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        mat[x][y] = True
    sol = [[-1] * (W + 2) for x in range(H + 2)]

    def rec(xx, yy):
        if sol[xx][yy] != -1:
            return sol[xx][yy]
        r = 0
