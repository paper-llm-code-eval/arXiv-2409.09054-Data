Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `deal.in` and write to `deal.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

Example:
`deal.in`
```
7
10 2 2 2 7 5 2
```

`deal.out`
```
22
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
N = int(open("deal.in").readline())
h = sorted(int(x) for x in open("deal.in").readline().split())
s = h[-1]
for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1):
    if h[i] == s:
        continue
    s += h[i]
open("deal.out", "w").write(str(s))
```

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 5, in <module>
    if h[i] == s:
       ~^^^
IndexError: list index out of range

```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.
Implement a solution to fix the program

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.

The error was caused by the fact that the loop started from `N - 2`, so when the loop reached `i = -1`, it tried to access `h[-1]`, which is out of bounds, hence the index error.
To fix this, one can start the loop from `N - 1`.
Here is the full fixed code:
```python
N = int(open("deal.in").readline())
h = sorted(int(x) for x in open("deal.in").readline().split())
s = h[-1]
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    if h[i] == s:
        continue
    s += h[i]
open("deal.out", "w").write(str(s))
```
