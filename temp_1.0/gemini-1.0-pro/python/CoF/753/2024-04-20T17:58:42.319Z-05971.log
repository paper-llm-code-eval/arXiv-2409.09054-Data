Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `harry.in` and write to `harry.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Tânărul Harry Potter a descoperit într-una din camerele castelului Hogwarts, o hartă, care în urma unei vrăji a făcut să apară un text secret. Textul scris doar cu litere mici ale alfabetului englez, constituie o cheie spre o vrajă nouă folositoare la meciurile de vâjhaț. Cheia nouă se obține astfel:

* din textul secret se formează toate cuvintele posibile din litere aflate pe poziții consecutive
* dintre cuvintele formate se alege cel care este cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Se consideră că două cuvinte $a_1 a_2 a_3 \dots a_k$ < $b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots b_l$, cuvintele fiind date prin caracterele ce le compun, sunt în ordine lexicografică dacă există un indice $i \leq k$ sau $i \leq l$ astfel încât $a_i < b_i$ iar $a_j = b_j$ oricare ar fi $j < i$.

Exemplu: dacă textul găsit de Harry este `abcd` atunci din el se vor obține cuvintele: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `ab`, `bc`, `cd`, `abc`, `bcd`, `abcd`, iar soluția este `d` fiind cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, citind textul inițial, determină cuvântul cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic dintre toate cuvintele formate în modul explicat mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `harry.in` conține o singură linie pe care este scris textul inițial.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `harry.out` va conține pe prima linie cuvântul ce constituie soluție.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq$ lungime text $\leq 255$;

Example:
`harry.in`
```
tatep
```

`harry.out`
```
tep

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
tatep
```
Expected output:
```
tep
```
Found output:
```
t
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The issue with the previous solution was that it was not correctly handling the case when the current character is smaller than the last character of the current best word.
Here is the corrected solution in python that correctly handles this case:

```python
with open("harry.in", "r") as i:
    txt = i.readline().lower().strip()

curr = txt[0]
best = txt[0]
for s in txt[1:]:
    if s >= curr[-1]:
        curr += s
        if curr > best:
            best = curr
    else:
        curr = s
        if curr > best:
            best = curr
with open("harry.out", "w") as o:
    o.write(best + "\n")
```

The issue with the previous solution was that `best` was not updated correctly in case all the letters in the string are in decreasing order. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
with open("harry.in", "r") as i:
    txt = i.readline().lower().strip()

curr = txt[0]
best = txt[0]
for s in txt[1:]:
    if s >= curr[-1]:
        curr += s
        if curr > best:
            best = curr
    else:
        curr = s
        if s > best:
            best = s
    if best == txt:
        break
with open("harry.out", "w") as o:
    o.write(best + "\n")
else:
    with open("harry.out", "w") as o:
