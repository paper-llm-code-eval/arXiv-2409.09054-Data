Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cod.in` and write to `cod.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Dexter a moștenit o avere fabuloasă, dar este închisă într-un seif. Unchiul său, cel care i-a lăsat averea, a dorit să îl pună la încercare astfel: a umplut o cutie foarte mare cu bilețele pe care sunt scrise numere naturale din mulțimea $\{0, 1, 2, \dots, 99\}$. Pe fiecare bilețel este scris un singur număr. Dexter trebuie să formeze perechi de bilețele care au scrise pe ele același număr. La sfârșit, vor rămâne câteva bilețele fără pereche. Codul de acces la seif este format din numerele rămase pe bilețelele fără pereche, așezate în ordine crescătoare și fără spațiu între ele.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să furnizeze codul de acces la seif.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural n, reprezentând numărul bilețelelor aflate în cutie. Pe următoarea linie a fișierului se află cele n numere scrise pe bilețele, separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` va conține pe prima linie numerele din care este compus codul, în ordine crescătoare și fără spații între ele.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 90 \ 000$;

Example:
`cod.in`
```
10
11 3 11 11 12 2 11 12 3 11
```

`cod.out`
```
211
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The provided solution is almost correct, the only issue with the code is the order of the numbers in the output. To fix that we need to check if the value of the current key is 1, and if so, we append the key to the output list.
Here is the updated code:
```python
f = open("cod.in", "r")
g = open("cod.out", "w")

f.readline()
v = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

d = {}

for i in v:
    if i in d:
        d[i] += 1
    else:
        d[i] = 1

v.clear()

for i in d:
    if d[i] % 2 == 0:
        continue
    if d[i] == 1:
        v.append(str(i))

v.sort()
g.write(''.join(v))
```

The issue with the code was that the list `v` was being cleared after the loop where the dictionary `d` was being populated. This meant that the list `v` was empty when the second loop was trying to iterate over it.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
f = open("cod.in", "r")
g = open("cod.out", "w")

f.readline()
v = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

d = {}

for i in v:
    if i in d:
        d[i] += 1
    else:
        d[i] = 1

for i in d:
    if d[i] % 2 == 0:
        continue
    if d[i] == 1:
        v.append(str(i))

v.sort()
g.write(''.join(v))
```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The error message indicates that the `sort()` function is trying to compare a string with an integer. This is because the `v` list contains both strings and integers. To fix this, we can convert all the elements in the `v` list to integers before sorting.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
f = open("cod.in", "r")
g = open("cod.out", "w")

f.readline()
v = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

d = {}

for i in v:
    if i in d:
        d[i] += 1
    else:
        d[i] = 1

for i in d:
    if d[i] % 2 == 0:
        continue
    if d[i] == 1:
        v.append(i)

v.sort()
g.write(''.join(str(x) for x in v))

The issue with the code was that the `v` list was being appended with the keys from the `d` dictionary, which were integers. This meant that the `v` list contained both strings and integers, which caused the `sort()` function to fail.

To fix this, the code should be modified to append the keys from the `d` dictionary as strings.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
f = open("cod.in", "r")
g = open("cod.out", "w")

f.readline()
v = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

d = {}

for i in v:
    if i in d:
        d[i] += 1
    else:
        d[i] = 1

    if d[i] == 1:
