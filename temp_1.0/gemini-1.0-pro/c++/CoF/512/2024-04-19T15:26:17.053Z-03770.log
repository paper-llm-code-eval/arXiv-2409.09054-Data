Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `unificare.in` and write to `unificare.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Prin operația de **unificare** a două numere naturale $a$ și $b$ înțelegem obținerea celui mai mare număr care se poate forma din cifrele distincte din scrierea numărului $a$ și cifrele distincte din scrierea numărului $b$. De exemplu, unificând $a = 727952$ cu $b = 92868$ vom obține numărul $99876522$, deoarece din $a$ vom utiliza cifrele $2, 5, 7, 9$, iar din $b$ cifrele $2, 6, 8, 9$. Cel mai mare număr pe care îl putem forma cu aceste cifre este $99876522$. 

Operația de unificare poate fi aplicată și pentru $k$ numere, respectând aceeași regulă: pentru fiecare număr din cele $k$ identificăm cifrele distincte care apar în scrierea lui, apoi determinăm cel mai mare număr care se poate forma utilizând toate aceste cifre. De exemplu, unificând numerele $112$, $223$ și $12334$ vom obține $43322211$.

Se dau două numere naturale, $n$ și $k$, și un șir de $n$ numere naturale $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.

# Cerințe

Determinați și afișați:
1. cel mai mare număr de exact $k$ cifre din șirul dat;
2. cel mai mare număr care poate fi obținut prin unificarea a două valori aflate pe poziții alăturate în șirul dat;
3. cel mai mare număr care se poate obține prin unificarea a $k$ valori aflate pe poziții consecutive în șirul dat.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `unificare.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, reprezentând cerința ce trebuie rezolvată ($1$, $2$ sau $3$), pe a doua linie $n$ și $k$, cu semnificația din enunț, iar pe a treia linie cei $n$ termeni ai șirului precizațîn ordinea din șir. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `unificare.out`:
* dacă $C = 1$, se va afișa pe prima linie cel mai mare număr de $k$ cifre din șirul dat;
* dacă $C = 2$, se va afișa pe prima linie cel mai mare număr obținut prin unificarea a două numere alăturate în șir;
* dacă $C = 3$, se va afișa pe prima linie valoarea maximă obținută prin unificarea a $k$ valori aflate pe poziții consecutive.

# Restricții și precizări

* $C \in \{1,2,3\}$; $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$; $1 \leq k \leq n/2$;
* $0 \leq a_i \leq 100 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru oricare $1 \leq i \leq n$;
* Pentru $20$ de puncte, $C = 1$ și $k \leq 8$;
* Pentru $5$ puncte, $C = 2$ și $n = 2$;
* Pentru $10$ puncte, $C = 2$ și $0 \leq a_i \leq 9$, pentru oricare $1 \leq i \leq n$;
* Pentru $35$ de puncte, $C = 2$ și nu există restricții suplimentare;
* Pentru $15$ puncte, $C = 3$ și $k \leq 8$;
* Pentru $15$ puncte, $C = 3$ și $k \leq n / 2$.

The issue here is again missing `std::` prefix for `begin` and `end`, plus the logic of finding the maximum number for k values in `a` is wrong. The correct way to do so is to iterate over the existing numbers in the range, not generate all possible numbers.
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("unificare.in");
    ofstream out("unificare.out");

    int C, n, k;
    in >> C >> n >> k;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { in >> a[i]; }

    if (C == 1) {
        sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) { out << a[i]; }
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            vector<int> b;
            for (int x : a[i - 1]) {
                if (find(b.begin(), b.end(), x) == b.end()) { b.push_back(x); }
            }
            for (int x : a[i]) {
                if (find(b.begin(), b.end(), x) == b.end()) { b.push_back(x); }
            }
            sort(b.rbegin(), b.rend());
            int tmp = 0;
            for (int x : b) { tmp = tmp * 10 + x; }
            ans = max(ans, tmp);
        }
        out << ans << '\n';
    } else {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i + k - 1 < n; i++) {
            vector<int> b;
            for (int j = i; j <= i + k - 1; j++) {
                for (int x : a[j]) {

Evaluate the error message. Think of a solution to fix the program and return the entire source code with the fix.

---

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.

My bad, I forgot the `std::` prefix again. Here is the correct solution:
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("unificare.in");
    ofstream out("unificare.out");

    int C, n, k;
    in >> C >> n >> k;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { in >> a[i]; }

    if (C == 1) {
        sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) { out << a[i]; }
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            vector<int> b;
            for (int x : a[i - 1]) {
                if (find(b.begin(), b.end(), x) == b.end()) { b.push_back(x); }
            }
            for (int x : a[i]) {
                if (find(b.begin(), b.end(), x) == b.end()) { b.push_back(x); }
            }
            sort(b.rbegin(), b.rend());
            int tmp = 0;
            for (int x : b) { tmp = tmp * 10 + x; }
            ans = max(ans, tmp);
        }
        out << ans << '\n';
    } else {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i + k - 1 < n; i++) {
            vector<int> b;
            for (int j = i; j <= i + k - 1; j++) {
                for (int x : a[j]) {
                    if (find(b.begin(), b.end(), x) == b.end()) { b.push_back(x); }
                }
            }
            int tmp = 0;
            for (int x : b) { tmp = tmp * 10 + x; }
            ans = max(ans, tmp);
        }
        out << ans << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
