Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `armonica.in` and write to `armonica.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Spunem că trei numere `a, b, c` sunt în progresie armonică dacă `b` este media armonică a numerelor `a` și `c`, adică 

$$
b=\frac{2}{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{c}}=\frac{2ac}{a+c}
$$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând un număr natural `b` să se determine toate perechile de numere naturale `(a, c)` pentru care `a, b, c` sunt în progresie armonică.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `armonica.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural `b`. 

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de iesire `armonica.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural `n` reprezentând numărul de perechi de numere naturale `(a,c)` pentru care `b` este media armonică. Pe următoarele `n` linii se vor afișa perechile de numere cerute. Astfel fiecare dintre următoarele `n` linii vor conține căte două numere `a` și `c` separate printr-un spațiu cu semnificația că `b` este medie armonică a numerelor `a` și `c`. 

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ b ≤ 1 000 000 000`;
* Pentru teste în valoare de `40` de puncte avem `b ≤ 1 000 000`;
* Perechile de numere din fișierul de ieșire pot fi afișate în orice ordine;
* Dacă `b` este medie armonică între două numere diferite `a` și `c` atunci perechile `(a,c)` și `(c,a)` sunt considerate soluții distincte.
* Problema va fi evaluată pe teste în valoare de `90` de puncte.
* Se vor acorda `10` puncte din oficiu.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

The main difference between the expected and found output in this case is that the found output does not list all the possible solutions, just one, and it is incorrect.
The found output is incorrect because the value of `b` read from the input file is `3`.
Pairs that are solutions to the problem must satisfy the following conditions:
1. `a` + `c` must be divisible by `2` because `b` is the average between `a` and `c`.
2. `a` and `c` must both be greater than `b` because `a` and `c` are the extremes of the average and `b` is the middle.
3. `(a - b) * (c - b) = b * b` because `b` is the average between `a` and `c`.
In this case the value of `b` is `3`.
So we can start by listing pairs that satisfy the first condition: 
```
(4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 4), (4, 8), (8, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8)
```
Then verify that each pair satisfies the second and third conditions.
We notice that both pairs `(4, 4)` and `(6, 6)` satisfy all three conditions, but `(8, 8)` doesn't.
Then we verify if pairs `(4, 6)`, `(6, 4)`, `(4, 8)` and `(8, 4)` satisfy the second and third conditions, and we will notice they don't.
So the expected output is `3` solutions, because the valid pairs that satisfy all conditions are `(4, 4)`, `(4, 6)`, and `(6, 4)`.

Here is the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  FILE *fin = fopen("armonica.in", "r");
  FILE *fout = fopen("armonica.out", "w");
  int n, p;
  fscanf(fin, "%d", &n);
  for (int b = 2; b <= n << 1; b++) {
  	if (n % b != 0) continue;
    p = n / b;
    if (3 * n < (b - p) * (b + p)) continue;
    if (b < (b+p)/2) fprintf(fout, "%d %d\n", (b+p)/2, (b-p)/2);
    if (b > (b+p)/2) fprintf(fout, "%d %d\n", (b-p)/2, (b+p)/2);
  }
  return 0;
}

The found output is incorrect because it lists the pair `(1, 2)` which does not satisfy the problem's conditions because `b` is the average between `a` and `c` and in this case `b = 3` and `(1 + 2) / 2 != 3`.
