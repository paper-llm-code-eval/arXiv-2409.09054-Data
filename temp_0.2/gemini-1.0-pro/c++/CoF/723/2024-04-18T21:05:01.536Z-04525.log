Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `expresie.in` and write to `expresie.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un șir de $n$ numere naturale nenule $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ și un număr natural $m$.

# Cerință
Să se verifice dacă valoarea expresiei $\sqrt[m]{x_1 x_2 x_3 \dots x_n}$ este un număr natural. În caz afirmativ să se afișeze acest număr descompus în factori primi.

# Date de intrare
În fișierul `expresie.in` se află pe prima linie $m$, pe linia a doua $n$, iar pe linia a treia numerele $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_n$ separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul `expresie.out` se va scrie pe prima linie cifra $0$, dacă valoarea expresiei nu este un număr natural, respectiv $1$ dacă este un număr natural. 
Dacă valoarea expresiei este un număr natural, pe următoarele linii se vor scrie perechi de forma "$p\ e$" ($p$ este factor prim care apare în descompunere la puterea $e \geq 1$). Aceste perechi se vor scrie în ordine crescătoare după primul număr (adică $p$).

# Restricții
- $n$ este un număr natural nenul mai mic strict decât $5\ 000$.
- $x_i$ este un număr natural nenul mai mic strict decât $30\ 000$, $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.
- **$m$ poate fi una din cifrele $2$, $3$ sau $4$.**

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result is `0`, which indicates that the value of the expression is not a natural number, while the expected result is `1`, which indicates that the value of the expression is a natural number.

The reason for this difference is that the program incorrectly calculates the value of the expression. Specifically, the program uses the following line of code to calculate the value of the expression:

```c++
long long ans = (long long)pow(prod, 1.0 / m);
```

This line of code calculates the value of the expression using the `pow` function from the `<cmath>` header file. However, the `pow` function is not accurate for large values of its arguments. In this case, the value of `prod` is very large, and the value of `m` is small, which causes the `pow` function to return an inaccurate result.

To fix this issue, we can use a different method to calculate the value of the expression. One possible method is to use the following loop:

```c++
long long ans = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ans *= (long long)pow(v[i], 1.0 / m);
}
```

This loop calculates the value of the expression by multiplying the m-th root of each number in the array. This method is more accurate than using the `pow` function for large values of its arguments.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("expresie.in");
    ofstream out("expresie.out");

    in >> m >> n;
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        in >> v[i];
    }
    in.close();

    long long prod = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prod *= v[i];
    }
    long long ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ans *= (long long)pow(v[i], 1.0 / m);
    }
    if (ans * ans * ans * ans != prod) {
        out << 0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    out << 1 << endl;
