Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `deal.in` and write to `deal.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

`deal.in`
```

`deal.out`

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple consecutive towers of the same height. In this case, the solution should only count the tallest tower in the consecutive group as part of the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("deal.in");
    ofstream out("deal.out");

    int n;
    in >> n;

    vector<int> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        in >> h[i];
    }

    sort(h.begin(), h.end());

    int sum = 0;
    int last = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (h[i] > last) {
            sum += h[i];
            last = h[i];
            count = 1;
        } else {
            count++;
        }
    }

    out << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution keeps track of the count of consecutive towers of the same height using the `count` variable. When the height of a tower changes, the solution adds the tallest tower in the consecutive group to the sum and resets the `count` variable to 1.

Here is the output of the corrected solution for the given input:

    }

    return 0;

```

This solution keeps track of the last tower that was added to the sum using the `last` variable. When the height of a tower changes, the solution checks if the current tower is taller than the last tower that was added to the sum. If it is, the solution adds the current tower to the sum and updates the `last` variable.

The issue with the previous solution is that it subtracts the current tower from the sum when the `count` variable is greater than 1, even if the current tower is the tallest tower in the consecutive group. This can lead to incorrect results, as in the given input.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

    }

    sort(h.begin(), h.end());

    int sum = 0;
    int last = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (h[i] > last) {
            sum += h[i];

        if (count > 1 && h[i] < last) {
            sum -= h[i];
        }
    }

    out << sum << endl;

    return 0;

This solution adds the tallest tower to the sum and subtracts the other towers in the consecutive group if the `count` variable is greater than 1 and the current tower is not the tallest tower in the consecutive group.
