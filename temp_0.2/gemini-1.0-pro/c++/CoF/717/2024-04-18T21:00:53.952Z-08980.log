Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

---

Să considerăm următorul şir:

`a`$,$ `b`$,$ `ba`$,$ `bab`$,$ `babba`$,$ `babbabab`$, \dots$

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine care este cel de-al $n$-lea termen al şirului

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `sir.in` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul natural $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `sir.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care se află al $n$-lea termen din şir

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 20$;

Example:
`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
bab
```

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```c++
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("sir.in");
  ofstream out("sir.out");
  int n;
  in >> n;
  string s = "a";
  while (--n) {
    s = s + "b" + s;
  }

  return 0;
}

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
4
```
Expected output:
```
bab
```
Found output:
```
abababababababa
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't handle the case when `n` is equal to 1 correctly. When `n` is 1, the output should be "a", but the code generates "abababababababa".

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("sir.in");
  ofstream out("sir.out");
  int n;
  in >> n;
  string s = "a";
  if (n == 1) {
    out << s << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  while (--n) {
    s = s + "b" + s;
  }
  out << s << endl;
  return 0;
}
