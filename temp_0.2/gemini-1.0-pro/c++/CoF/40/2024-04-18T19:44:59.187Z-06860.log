Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `ubuntzei.in` and write to `ubuntzei.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Trei ubuntzei au hotărât ca anul acesta să petreacă ziua de 1 Mai pe malul Mării Negre împreună cu prietenii lor, motiv pentru care au pus la cale o excursie pe un traseu care să plece din oraşul lor Cluj-Napoca spre Vama Veche, unde nisipul îi aşteaptă. 

În ţara ubuntzeilor există $N$ localităţi, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, legate între ele prin $M$ şosele bidirecţionale de diferite lungimi. Localitatea de plecare a ubuntzeilor, oraşul Cluj-Napoca, este numerotată cu $1$, iar localitatea destinaţie, Vama Veche, cu $N$. Între oricare două localităţi există cel mult o şosea. Fiecare şosea uneşte două localităţi distincte şi se poate călători între oricare două localităţi circulând numai pe şosele. 

Prietenii ubuntzeilor locuiesc în $K$ localităţi distincte, diferite de Cluj-Napoca şi Vama Veche. Pentru a nu călători singuri, cei trei ubuntzei vor să treacă prin cele $K$ localităţi în care locuiesc prietenii lor, şi apoi, împreună cu aceştia, să-şi continue excursia către mare.

Nerăbdători să ajungă cât mai repede la destinaţie, ubuntzeii s-au hotărât să îşi stabilească un traseu de lungime minimă care să treacă prin toate cele $K$ localităţi. 

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să determine, pentru ubuntzei, lungimea minimă $L$ a unui traseu de la Cluj-Napoca la Vama Veche ce trece prin toate cele $K$ localităţi.

# Date de intrare
Prima linie a fişierului de intrare `ubuntzei.in` conţine două numere naturale $N\ M$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ. A doua linie a fişierului conţine $K + 1$ numere naturale distincte: $K\ C_1\ C_2\ ...\ C_K$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, $K$ având semnificaţia din enunţ iar $C_1, C_2, ..., C_K$ reprezentând cele $K$ localităţi în care locuiesc prietenii. Fiecare din următoarele $M$ linii conţine câte trei numere naturale $x\ y\ z$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând o şosea care leagă localitatea $x$ de localitatea $y$ şi are lungimea $z$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `ubuntzei.out` va conţine numărul natural $L$ reprezentând lungimea minimă căutată.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N ≤ 2\ 000$
* $1 ≤ M ≤ 10\ 000$
* $0 ≤ K ≤ \min\{15, N – 2\}$
* $2 ≤ C_1, C_2, ..., C_K ≤ N – 1$
* Traseul poate trece de mai multe ori prin oricare localitate.
* Costul unei muchii va fi cuprins între $1$ şi $10^5$.
* Pentru primele $20%$ din teste $K = 0$.
* Pentru primele $50%$ din teste $K ≤ 10$.
* Pentru primele $70%$ din teste $N ≤ 200$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:
