Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `panglica.in` and write to `panglica.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Gigel are o panglică alcătuită din benzi de $1 cm$ lăţime, colorate în diverse culori. Panglica are $N$ benzi, fiecare colorată cu una din $C$ culori, culori pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $C$. Gigel vrea ca la ambele capete ale panglicii să aibă aceeaşi culoare, dar cum nu poate schimba culorile benzilor, singura posibilitate rămâne tăierea unor bucăţi de la capete. 

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine modul de tăiere a panglicii astfel încât la cele două capete să fie benzi de aceeaşi culoare, iar lungimea panglicii obţinute să fie maximă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `panglica.in` conţine:

- pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ şi $C$ separate printr-un spaţiu;
- pe următoarele $N$ linii descrierea panglicii: pe fiecare linie un număr natural de la $1$ la $C$, reprezentând în ordine culorile fâşiilor ce alcătuiesc panglica.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `panglica.out` va conţine următoarele $4$ numere:

- pe prima linie numărul de fâşii rămase;
- pe linia a doua numărul culorii care se află la capete;
- pe linia a treia câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la începutul panglicii iniţiale;
- pe linia a patra câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la sfârşitul panglicii iniţiale

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq C \leq 200$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii alegeţi pe cea în care se taie cât mai puţin din partea de început a panglicii.

The bug in the previous solution was that it didn't handle the case when the entire ribbon had the same color. In this case, the prefix_length and suffix_length would both be equal to n, and the program would output that the entire ribbon should be cut off, which is incorrect.

Here is the fixed solution:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("panglica.in");
    ofstream out("panglica.out");

    vector<int> colors(n);
