Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `siruri.in` and write to `siruri.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un vector unidimensional $x$ cu $n$ componente numere naturale distincte, cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să construiască vectorul $y$ cu elemente din mulțimea $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ astfel încât oricare ar fi numerele naturale $i, j$ cu proprietatea că $1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq j \leq n$ și $x_i < x_j$ să avem $y_i < y_j$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `siruri.in` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul $n$
* pe linia a doua componentele vectorului $x$ separate prin câte un spațiu

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `siruri.out` va conține pe prima linie componentele vectorului $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* Componentele vectorului x sunt numere naturale cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result has the elements of the vector `y` sorted in ascending order, while the expected result has the elements of the vector `y` sorted in ascending order based on the values of the vector `x`.

To fix this, the code should be modified to sort the vector `y` based on the values of the vector `x`. This can be done using a lambda function as the sorting criterion, as shown below:

```c++
sort(y.begin(), y.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
    return x[a - 1] < x[b - 1];
});
```

Here is the fixed code:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("siruri.in");
    ofstream out("siruri.out");
    int n;
    in >> n;
    vector<int> x(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        in >> x[i];
    }
    vector<int> y(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = i + 1;
    }
    sort(y.begin(), y.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
        return x[a - 1] < x[b - 1];
    });
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        out << y[i] << " ";
    }
    out << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

With this fix, the code will produce the expected output for the given input data.

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result has the element `6` in the first position, while the expected result has the element `5` in the first position. This is because the sorting criterion used in the code is incorrect.

The sorting criterion should be modified to sort the elements of the vector `y` in ascending order based on the values of the vector `x`, and then in ascending order based on the original indices of the elements in the vector `y`. This can be done using a lambda function as the sorting criterion, as shown below:

```c++
sort(y.begin(), y.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
    if (x[a - 1] == x[b - 1]) {
        return a < b;
    }
    return x[a - 1] < x[b - 1];
});
