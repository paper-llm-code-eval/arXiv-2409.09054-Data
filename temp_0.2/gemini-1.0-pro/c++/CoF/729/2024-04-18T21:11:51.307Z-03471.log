Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `siruri.in` and write to `siruri.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un vector unidimensional $x$ cu $n$ componente numere naturale distincte, cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să construiască vectorul $y$ cu elemente din mulțimea $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ astfel încât oricare ar fi numerele naturale $i, j$ cu proprietatea că $1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq j \leq n$ și $x_i < x_j$ să avem $y_i < y_j$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `siruri.in` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul $n$
* pe linia a doua componentele vectorului $x$ separate prin câte un spațiu

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `siruri.out` va conține pe prima linie componentele vectorului $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* Componentele vectorului x sunt numere naturale cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

Example:
`siruri.in`
```
6
12 3 7 16 10 1
```

`siruri.out`
```
5 2 3 6 4 1

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
6
12 3 7 16 10 1
```
Expected output:
```
5 2 3 6 4 1
```
Found output:
```
6 2 3 5 1 4
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The bug in the previous solution was that the `y` vector was sorted using the values of the `x` vector, but the `y` vector should have been sorted using the values of the `y` vector.

Here is the fixed solution:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("siruri.in");
  ofstream out("siruri.out");
  int n;
  in >> n;
  vector<int> x(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    in >> x[i];
  }
  vector<int> y(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = i + 1;
  }
  sort(y.begin(), y.end(), [&](int a, int b) { return y[a - 1] < y[b - 1]; });
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    out << y[i] << " ";
  }
  out << endl;
  return 0;
