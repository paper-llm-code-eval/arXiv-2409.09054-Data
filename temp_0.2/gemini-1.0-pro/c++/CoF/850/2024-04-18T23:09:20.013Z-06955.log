Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `ferma.in` and write to `ferma.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un fermier deține o fermă de formă dreptunghiulară cu lungimea $m$ metri și lățimea $n$ metri. Respectând principiul rotației culturilor, fermierul și a realizat un plan pentru semănarea culturilor în noul an. Astfel, el a desenat un dreptunghi pe care l-a împărțit în $m \cdot n$ celule, fiecare corespunzând unui metru pătrat, și a colorat în culori diferite zonele care corespund unor culturi diferite. O cultură poate fi semănată pe mai multe parcele. Două celule care au o latură comună aparțin aceleiași parcele dacă au aceeași culoare (sunt însămânțate cu aceeași cultură).  Fermierul are posibilitatea să irige o sigură parcelă și dorește să aleagă parcela cu cea mai mare suprafață. Nefiind mulțumit de suprafața rezultată, s-a întrebat dacă ar putea schimba cultura de pe o singură celulă, astfel încât să obțină o parcelă de suprafață mai mare.

Exemplu de fermă (_imagine 1_):

# Cerință

Dându-se dimensiunile fermei și pentru fiecare celulă culoarea corespunzătoare culturii semănate, determinați:

1. **Varianta 1:** Suprafața maximă a unei parcele în planul inițial.
2. **Varianta 2:** Numărul liniei, respectiv al coloanei celulei pe care va semăna o altă cultură și culoarea corespunzătoare noii culturi în vederea obţinerii celei mai mari parcele posibile.


# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `ferma.in` va conține:]

* pe prima linie un număr natural $v$ ($1 ≤ v ≤ 2$) indicând varianta cerinței de rezolvare
* pe a doua linie două numere naturale $m$ şi $n$ separate printr-un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț
* pe fiecare dintre următoarele $m$ linii se găsesc câte $n$ caractere (litere mici), reprezentând codurile culturilor ce vor fi semănate pe cele $n$ celule corespunzătoare fiecărei linii. 


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `ferma.out` va conține:
**Varianta 1** – pentru $v=1$: 
* pe prima linie numărul natural $s$, reprezentând suprafața maximă a unei parcele.

**Varianta 2** – pentru $v=2$: 
* pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând numărul liniei, respectiv al coloanei celulei pe care va semăna o altă cultură, în vederea obținerii unei parcele cu suprafața maximă; 
* pe a doua linie un caracter reprezentând codul culorii corespunzătoare noii culturi din celula determinată.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n, m \leq 400$
* Numărul de culturi distincte este cel puţin $2$ şi cel mult $26$.
* $30\%$ din teste vor avea pe prima linie valoarea $1$, iar restul de $70\%$ din teste vor avea pe prima linie valoarea $2$.
* Pentru varianta $2$ se punctează orice soluție care conduce la obținerea unei parcele cu suprafața maximă. Nu se acordă punctaje parțiale.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not consider the case when the maximum area could be achieved by changing the color of a cell to the color of an adjacent cell. To fix this, I have added a check to see if the area of the current cell plus the area of the adjacent cell is greater than the current maximum area. If it is, then I update the maximum area and the coordinates of the cell that needs to be changed.

Here is the fixed code:

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not consider the case when the maximum area could be achieved by changing the color of a cell to the color of an adjacent cell that is part of a different connected component, and the sum of the areas of the two connected components is greater than the area of the largest connected component in the original grid, and the color of the adjacent cell is the same as the color of the largest connected component in the original grid. To fix this, I have added a check to see if the sum of the areas of the current cell and the adjacent cell is greater than the current maximum area, even if the adjacent cell is part of a different connected component and the color of the adjacent cell is the same as the color of the largest connected component in the original grid.
