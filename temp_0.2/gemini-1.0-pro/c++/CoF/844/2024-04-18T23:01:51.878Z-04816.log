_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

The issue with the previous solution was that it was not correctly finding the maximum digit in the number `n` that required the minimum number of dots to print. The previous solution was simply finding the digit that required the minimum number of dots to print, regardless of whether or not that digit was actually present in the number `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("imprimanta.in");
  ofstream out("imprimanta.out");

  long long n, k;
  in >> n >> k;

  vector<int> cifre = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
  vector<int> puncte = {2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

  int max_cifra = 0;
  int min_puncte = 1000000000;
  for (int i = 0; i < cifre.size(); i++) {
    if (n % 10 == cifre[i] && puncte[i] < min_puncte) {
      min_puncte = puncte[i];
      max_cifra = cifre[i];
    }
    n /= 10;
  }

  int max_numar = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < cifre.size(); i++) {
    if (puncte[i] <= k) {
      max_numar = max(max_numar, cifre[i]);
    }
  }

  out << max_cifra << endl;
  out << max_numar << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This solution first finds the maximum digit in the number `n` that requires the minimum number of dots to print. It does this by iterating through the digits of `n` from right to left, and for each digit, checking if it is one of the digits that requires the minimum number of dots to print. If it is, then the solution updates the `max_cifra` variable to the current digit and the `min_puncte` variable to the minimum number of dots required to print the current digit.

Once the solution has found the maximum digit in `n` that requires the minimum number of dots to print, it then finds the largest number that can be printed with `k` dots. It does this by iterating through the digits from 0 to 9, and for each digit, checking if it can be printed with `k` dots. If it can, then the solution updates the `max_numar` variable to the current digit.

The solution then outputs the `max_cifra` and `max_numar` variables to the output file.

The issue with the previous solution was that it was not correctly finding the maximum digit in the number `n` that required the minimum number of dots to print. The previous solution was only checking if the last digit of `n` was one of the digits that required the minimum number of dots to print.

  int max_cifra = 0;
