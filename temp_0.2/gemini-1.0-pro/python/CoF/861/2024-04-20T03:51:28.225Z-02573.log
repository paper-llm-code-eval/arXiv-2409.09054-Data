Ca în mai toate poveștile, Făt-Frumos a căutat o Cosânzeană și a găsit-o, dar tatăl ei i-a cerut să-i paveze drumul de lungime $N$ care leagă castelele sale. Dalele cu care va pava drumul au aceeași lățime (egală cu lățimea drumului) și lungimi numere naturale. Fiind un împărat cam sâcâit, acesta dorește ca pavarea să se facă folosind un număr minim de dale, diferența de lungime între două dale vecine să nu fie mai mare ca $1$, iar prima și ultima dală să fie de lungime $1$. Împăratul nu se mulțumește să primească de la Făt-Frumos doar un număr (numărul minim de dale necesare): el vrea și posibilitatea de pavare cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Compararea lexicografică a două șiruri de numere este o extensie la numere a comparării alfabetice a două cuvinte. Astfel, fiind date două șiruri numerice de aceeași lungime, $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m$ și $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m$, acestea sunt egale dacă și numai dacă $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $m$. Șirul $A$ este mai mic lexicografic decât șirul $B$ dacă există o valoare $k$ astfel încât $A_k < B_k$ și $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $k - 1$. De exemplu, șirul $3, 5, 4, 1$ este mai mare lexicografic decât șirul $3, 5, 2, 9$ pentru că prima poziție pe care valorile diferă este poziția $3$ ($4 > 2$), fără a mai conta valorile aflate după aceasta.

# Cerință

Cunoscând lungimea drumului, determinați numărul minim de dale necesare pavării și posibilitatea de pavare cu număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Date de intrare

Prima linie a fișierului `pavare.in` conține un număr natural $V$. Linia a doua conține un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă lungimea drumului.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $1$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, doar numărul minim de dale necesare pavării.

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $2$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, un șir de numere separate prin câte un spațiu, ce reprezintă soluția de pavare a drumului, folosind un număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Restricții și precizări

* $V \in \{1,2\}$
* $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$;
* Pentru $30$% din punctaj $V = 1$.

The difference between the expected and found result is that the program incorrectly calculated the minimum number of tiles needed to pave the road. The correct number of tiles is 5, but the program found 4.

The error in the program is in the calculation of the number of tiles needed. The program calculates the number of tiles as `n // 2 + 1`, where `n` is the length of the road. However, this formula only works if the length of the road is even. If the length of the road is odd, then the number of tiles needed is `n // 2 + 2`.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
with open('pavare.in', 'r') as f:
    v = int(f.readline())
    n = int(f.readline())

with open('pavare.out', 'w') as f:
    if v == 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            f.write(str(n // 2 + 1))

The difference between the expected and found result is that the program incorrectly calculated the lexicographically smallest way to pave the road. The correct way to pave the road is `1 1 2 2 1`, but the program found `3 1 3`.

The error in the program is in the way it calculates the lexicographically smallest way to pave the road. The program calculates the lexicographically smallest way to pave the road by starting with the largest tile that can fit on the road, and then adding smaller tiles until the road is completely paved. However, this method does not always produce the lexicographically smallest way to pave the road.
