Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `iepuri.in` and write to `iepuri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not take into account the fact that the boss rabbit must eat at least one carrot more than each of his subordinates. To fix this, I have modified the `dfs` function to keep track of the minimum number of carrots that each rabbit must eat.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
import sys

def main():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as f:
        n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            a, b = map(int, f.readline().split())
            adj[a].append(b)

    dp = [[[-1] * (k + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    def dfs(node, parent, carrots, min_carrots):
        if dp[node][parent][carrots] != -1:
            return dp[node][parent][carrots]

        ans = 0
        if carrots == 0:
            ans = 1
        else:
            for i in range(min_carrots, carrots + 1):
                if parent == 0 or i < parent:
                    ans += dfs(node, i, carrots - i, i)

        dp[node][parent][carrots] = ans % 30011
        return ans % 30011

    result = dfs(1, 0, k, 1)
    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(result))

if __name__ == '__main__':

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not correctly handle the case where the boss rabbit has no subordinates. In this case, the boss rabbit can eat any number of carrots between 1 and `k`, inclusive.

            a, b = map(int, f.readline().split())
            adj[a].append(b)

    dp = [[[-1] * (k + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    def dfs(node, parent, carrots, min_carrots):

        else:
            for i in range(min_carrots, carrots + 1):
                if parent == 0 or i < parent:
                    ans += dfs(node, i, carrots - i, i)

        dp[node][parent][carrots] = ans % 30011
