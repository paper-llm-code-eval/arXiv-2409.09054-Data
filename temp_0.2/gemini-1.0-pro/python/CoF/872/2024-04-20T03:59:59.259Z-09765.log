În anul $2214$ a izbucnit primul război interstelar. Pământul a fost atacat de către $n$ civilizații extraterestre, pe care le vom numerota pentru simplicitate de la $1$ la $n$.

Pentru a se apăra, pământenii au inventat o armă specială ce poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, fabricate dintr-un material special denumit narun. Dacă arma este programată la nivelul $p$, atunci un proiectil de greutate $k$ va ajunge exact la distanța $k^p$ km ($k$ la puterea $p$) față de Pământ și dacă în acel punct se află cartierul general al unui atacator, acesta va fi distrus. De exemplu, dacă arma este programată la nivelul $2$, un proiectil de greutate 10 va distruge cartierul general al extratereștrilor situat la distanța $10^2 = 100$ km de Pământ.
Arma poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, dar cum narunul este un material foarte rar și foarte scump, pământenii vor să folosească proiectile cât mai ușoare pentru a distruge cartierele generale inamice.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se $n$, numărul atacatorilor, precum și cele $n$ distanțe până la cartierele generale ale acestora, să se scrie un program care determină:

1. Cantitatea minimă de narun necesară pentru a distruge toate cartierele generale inamice;
2. Nivelurile la care trebuie programată arma, pentru a distruge fiecare cartier general inamic cu o cantitate minimă de narun.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arma.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $c$ reprezentând cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Pe cea de a doua linie se află numărul natural $n$, reprezentând numărul atacatorilor. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se află $n$ numere naturale, câte un număr pe o linie; pe cea de a $i$-a linie dintre cele $n$ se află distanța față de Pământ a cartierului general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre

# Date de ieșire

Dacă cerința $c = 1$, atunci pe prima linie a fișierului `arma.out` va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cantitatea minimă de narun necesară distrugerii tuturor cartierelor generale inamice.

Dacă cerința este $c = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `arma.out` va conține $n$ linii. Pe a $i$-a linie se va scrie nivelul la care trebuie programată arma pentru a distruge cartierul general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Distanțele până la cartierele generale inamice sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru $50$% dintre teste cerința este $1$.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly calculate the minimum amount of narun needed to destroy all enemy headquarters. The correct formula is to sum the square root of each distance, not the distance itself.

Here is the corrected solution in python:

**Explanation of the differences between the expected and found result:**

The expected output is 122, but the found output is 6405. This is because the previous solution incorrectly calculated the minimum amount of narun needed to destroy all enemy headquarters. The correct formula is to sum the square root of each distance, not the distance itself.

**Rewritten solution using a different algorithm:**

Here is a rewritten solution using a different algorithm:

```python
import sys

def main():
    with open('arma.in', 'r') as f:
        c = int(f.readline())
        n = int(f.readline())
        dist = [int(f.readline()) for _ in range(n)]

    dist.sort()

    if c == 1:
        ans = 0
        for d in dist:
            ans += int(d ** 0.5)
        with open('arma.out', 'w') as f:
            f.write(str(ans))
    else:
        ans = []
        for d in dist:
            p = 2
            while d % p != 0:
                p += 1
            ans.append(p)
        with open('arma.out', 'w') as f:
            for a in ans:
                f.write(str(a) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution uses a greedy algorithm to find the minimum amount of narun needed to destroy all enemy headquarters. The algorithm works by sorting the distances in ascending order and then iterating through them. For each distance, the algorithm finds the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the distance. This power of 2 is the level at which the weapon must be programmed to destroy the enemy headquarters at that distance. The algorithm then adds the square root of the distance to the total amount of narun needed.

This algorithm is more efficient than the previous solution because it does not need to check every possible power of 2 for each distance. It only needs to check the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the distance.

I hope this helps!
