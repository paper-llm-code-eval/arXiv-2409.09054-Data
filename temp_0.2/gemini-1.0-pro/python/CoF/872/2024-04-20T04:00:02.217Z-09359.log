Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `arma.in` and write to `arma.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În anul $2214$ a izbucnit primul război interstelar. Pământul a fost atacat de către $n$ civilizații extraterestre, pe care le vom numerota pentru simplicitate de la $1$ la $n$.

Pentru a se apăra, pământenii au inventat o armă specială ce poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, fabricate dintr-un material special denumit narun. Dacă arma este programată la nivelul $p$, atunci un proiectil de greutate $k$ va ajunge exact la distanța $k^p$ km ($k$ la puterea $p$) față de Pământ și dacă în acel punct se află cartierul general al unui atacator, acesta va fi distrus. De exemplu, dacă arma este programată la nivelul $2$, un proiectil de greutate 10 va distruge cartierul general al extratereștrilor situat la distanța $10^2 = 100$ km de Pământ.
Arma poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, dar cum narunul este un material foarte rar și foarte scump, pământenii vor să folosească proiectile cât mai ușoare pentru a distruge cartierele generale inamice.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se $n$, numărul atacatorilor, precum și cele $n$ distanțe până la cartierele generale ale acestora, să se scrie un program care determină:

1. Cantitatea minimă de narun necesară pentru a distruge toate cartierele generale inamice;
2. Nivelurile la care trebuie programată arma, pentru a distruge fiecare cartier general inamic cu o cantitate minimă de narun.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arma.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $c$ reprezentând cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Pe cea de a doua linie se află numărul natural $n$, reprezentând numărul atacatorilor. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se află $n$ numere naturale, câte un număr pe o linie; pe cea de a $i$-a linie dintre cele $n$ se află distanța față de Pământ a cartierului general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre

# Date de ieșire

Dacă cerința $c = 1$, atunci pe prima linie a fișierului `arma.out` va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cantitatea minimă de narun necesară distrugerii tuturor cartierelor generale inamice.

Dacă cerința este $c = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `arma.out` va conține $n$ linii. Pe a $i$-a linie se va scrie nivelul la care trebuie programată arma pentru a distruge cartierul general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Distanțele până la cartierele generale inamice sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru $50$% dintre teste cerința este $1$.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly calculate the minimum amount of narun needed to destroy all enemy headquarters. It calculates the sum of the square roots of the distances to the headquarters, which is not the correct approach.

The correct approach is to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $k^2$ is greater than or equal to all the distances to the headquarters. This can be done by sorting the distances and then finding the smallest integer $k$ such that $k^2$ is greater than or equal to the last distance in the sorted list.

Here is the corrected solution in Python:

```python
import sys

def main():
    with open('arma.in', 'r') as f_in, open('arma.out', 'w') as f_out:
        c = int(f_in.readline())
        n = int(f_in.readline())
        dist = [int(f_in.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
        dist.sort()

        if c == 1:
            mn = 0
            for d in dist:
                mn += int(d ** 0.5)
            f_out.write(str(mn) + '\n')
        else:
            for d in dist:
                p = 1
                while d % p == 0:
                    p *= 2
                p //= 2
                f_out.write(str(p) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
