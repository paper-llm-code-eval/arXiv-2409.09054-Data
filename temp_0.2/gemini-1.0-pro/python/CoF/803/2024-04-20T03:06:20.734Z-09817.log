Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `expozitie.in` and write to `expozitie.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Ilinca este o fetiţă căreia îi place foarte mult să deseneze; ea a făcut multe desene pe care le-a numerotat de la $1$ la $d$ şi apoi le-a multiplicat (toate copiile poartă acelaşi număr ca şi originalul după care au fost făcute). În vacanţă s-a hotărât să-şi deschidă propria expoziţie pe gardul bunicilor care are mai multe scânduri; pe fiecare scândură ea aşează o planşă (un desen original sau o copie). Ilinca ţine foarte mult la desenele ei şi doreşte ca fiecare desen să apară de cel puţin $k$ ori (folosind originalul şi copiile acestuia). Ilinca se întreabă în câte moduri ar putea aranja expoziţia. Două moduri de aranjare sunt considerate distincte dacă diferă cel puţin prin numărul unei planşe (de exemplu: $2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 3$ este aceeaşi expoziţie ca şi $2 \ 3 \ 1 \ 3$, dar este diferită de $2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 1$ şi de $1 \ 3 \ 3 \ 1$).

# Cerinţă

Cunoscând $n$ numărul de scânduri din gard, $d$ numărul desenelor originale şi $k$ numărul minim de apariţii al fiecărui desen, să se determine în câte moduri poate fi aranjată expoziţia, ştiind că Ilinca are la dispoziţie oricâte copii doreşte.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `expozitie.in` va conţine $3$ numere, $n \ d \ k$ - numărul de scânduri, numărul desenelor originale, respectiv numărul minim de aparţii.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `expozitie.out` va conţine un singur număr, $nr$, numărul modurilor distincte de aranjare a expoziţiei.


# Restricții și precizări

* $n,k,d$ sunt numere naturale
* $1 \leq n \leq 500$
* $1 \leq d \leq 500$
* $0 \leq k \leq n$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
3 2 1
```
Expected output:
```
2
```
Found output:
```
8
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not take into account the fact that each drawing must appear at least `k` times. To fix this, we need to subtract `k - 1` from the number of possible choices for each drawing. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import sys

with open("expozitie.in", "r") as f:
    n, d, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

with open("expozitie.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(((d - k + 1) ** n) % (10 ** 9 + 7)))
```

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not take into account the fact that the order of the drawings does not matter. To fix this, we need to divide the result by the number of permutations of `n` elements, which is `n!`. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import sys
from math import factorial

with open("expozitie.in", "r") as f:
    n, d, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

with open("expozitie.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(((d - k + 1) ** n) // factorial(n)))
