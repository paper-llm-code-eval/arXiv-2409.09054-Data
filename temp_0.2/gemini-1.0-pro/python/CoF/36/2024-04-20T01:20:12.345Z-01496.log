Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `subsecvente.in` and write to `subsecvente.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Fie `n` un număr natural și $M=\{S_1,S_2,…,S_n\}$ o mulțime de șiruri de caractere nevide. Fie $S_k$ un șir de caractere din `M`. Atunci, orice caracter al lui $S_k$ aparține mulțimii `{ 'a', 'b' }`. Notăm prin $|S_k|$ numărul caracterelor șirului $S_k$ sau, echivalent, lungimea sa. O subsecvență $S_k[i:j]$ a lui $S_k$ este formată din caracterele situate pe pozițiile consecutive `i, i+1, ..., j`. Astfel, dacă $S_k = abbbaababa$, atunci $S_k[3:6] = bbaa$ sau subsecvența evidențiată: ab**bbaa**baba.

# Cerință
Fiind dată o mulțime `M`, se cere să se determine lungimea maximă a unei subsecvențe care se găsește în toate șirurile din `M`.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `subsecvente.in` se găsește un număr natural `n` egal cu cardinalul mulțimii `M`. Pe fiecare din următoarele `n` linii se găsește câte un șir din mulțimea `M`.

# Date de ieșire
Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `subsecvente.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural egal cu lungimea subsecvenței găsite.

# Restricții
* `1 < n < 5`
* Dacă $|S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + … + |S_n|$, atunci `|S| < 50 001`
* Se garantează că va exista întotdeauna soluție
* Se garantează că rezultatul nu va depăși `60`
* Pentru `30%` din teste: `|S| < 101`
* Pentru `55%` din teste: `|S| < 3 501`
* Pentru `80%` din teste: `|S| < 10 001`

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open('subsecvente.in') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    s = [f.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

l = 0
for i in range(min(len(x) for x in s)):
    if all(x[i] == s[0][i] for x in s):
        l += 1
    else:
        break

with open('subsecvente.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(l))

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
4
abbabaaaaabb
aaaababab
bbbbaaaab
aaaaaaabaaab
```
Expected output:
```
5
```
Found output:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The issue with the previous solution is that it only checks if the character at position `i` is the same for all strings in the list. However, it does not check if the character at position `i+1` is also the same for all strings in the list. To fix this, we need to check if the character at position `i+1` is the same for all strings in the list before incrementing `i`.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('subsecvente.in') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    s = [f.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

l = 0
for i in range(min(len(x) for x in s)):
    if all(x[i] == s[0][i] for x in s) and all(x[i+1] == s[0][i+1] for x in s):
        l += 2
    else:
        break

with open('subsecvente.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(l))
