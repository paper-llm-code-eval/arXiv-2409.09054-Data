Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `yinyang.in` and write to `yinyang.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă o matrice $A$ cu $N$ linii și $M$ coloane, cu valori cuprinse între $1$ și $N \cdot M$ inclusiv, nu neapărat distincte. O **operație** constă în selectarea a două linii sau două coloane consecutive și interschimbarea acestora (swap). O matrice **yin-yang** este o matrice în care $A[i][j] \geq A[i][j – 1]$, pentru orice pereche $(i, j)$ cu $1 \leq i \leq N$ și $2 \leq j \leq M$ și $A[i][j] \geq A[i – 1][j]$, pentru orice pereche $(i, j)$ cu $2 \leq i \leq N$ și $1 \leq j \leq M$.

# Cerinţă

Să se determine numărul minim de operații necesare pentru a transforma matricea dată într-o matrice yin-yang.

# Date de intrare

În fișierul de intrare `yinyang.in` se află scrise pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $M$, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află câte $M$ numere naturale, reprezentând elementele matricei date $A$. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul `yinyang.out` se va scrie numărul minim de operații cerut sau $-1$ dacă nu există soluție.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N, M \leq 100$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $9$ puncte: $1 \leq N, M \leq 5$;
- Pentru alte teste în valoare de $18$ puncte: $N = 1$;
- Pentru alte teste în valoare de $36$ de puncte elementele din matrice sunt **DISTINCTE**.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
2 3

```
Expected output:
```

```
Found output:
```

```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The provided solution is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the fact that the matrix can be transformed into a yin-yang matrix by swapping rows or columns. To fix this, we need to check if the matrix can be transformed into a yin-yang matrix by swapping a single row or column.

Here is the fixed solution in python:
```python
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as fin, open('yinyang.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, m = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    a = [list(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ok = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, m):
