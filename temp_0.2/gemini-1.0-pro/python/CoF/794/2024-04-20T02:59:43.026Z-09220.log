Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `numar.in` and write to `numar.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un număr raţional strict pozitiv $q$, sub formă de fracţie zecimală.

# Cerință

Să se determine două numere naturale $a$ şi $b$ astfel încât $q = a / b$, iar modulul diferenţei dintre $a$ şi $b$ să fie minim.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul `numar.in` conţine:

* pe prima linie două valori naturale $ni$ şi $nz$. $ni$ reprezintă numărul de cifre care formeaza partea întreagă a lui $q$ iar $nz$ reprezintă numărul de cifre care formează partea fracţionara a lui $q$.
* pe a doua linie, $ni$ cifre care reprezintă partea întreagă a lui $q$. Între două cifre se află câte un caracter spaţiu.
* pe a treia linie, $nz$ cifre care reprezintă partea zecimală a lui $q$. Între două cifre se află câte un caracter spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `numar.out` va conţine:

* pe prima linie un număr natural $n_1$ care reprezintă numărul de cifre din care este alcătuit numărul $a$;
* pe a doua linie, cifrele numărului $a$, fără spaţiu între ele.
* pe a treia linie un număr natural $n_2$ care reprezintă numărul de cifre din care este alcătuit numărul $b$;
* pe a patra linie, cifrele numarului $b$, fără spaţiu între ele.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq ni, nz < 2 \ 000$.
* $1 \leq ni + nz \leq 2 \ 000$.
* Cifrele din care este alcătuit $q$ sunt cele din sistemul zecimal.
* Pentru $20$% dintre teste, $ni + nz \leq 9$; pentru alte $15$% dintre teste, $10 \leq ni + nz \leq 16$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

    a = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b = int(''.join(f.readline().split())) * 10 ** ni

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```

```
Expected output:
```

```
Found output:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the fact that the input number is a rational number, and it treats it as an integer. To fix this, we need to multiply the denominator by $10^{ni}$, where $ni$ is the number of digits in the integer part of the input number.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('numar.in') as f:
    ni, nz = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = int(''.join(f.readline().split()))
    b = int(''.join(f.readline().split())) * 10 ** ni

with open('numar.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{len(str(a))}\n{a}\n{len(str(b))}\n{b}')
