Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `leftmax.in` and write to `leftmax.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În clasa lui *Dexter* sunt $N$ elevi de înălțimi distincte. La ora de sport, ei sunt așezați în linie, de la stânga la dreapta. Profesorul lor, *Johnny*, va selecta pentru un exercițiu elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive în linie, astfel încât cel mai înalt elev dintre cei selectați să se afle în prima jumătate a acestora.

De exemplu, dacă elevii au, în ordine, înălțimile $1$, $5$, $4$, atunci profesorul poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $5$ și $4$, dar nu poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $1$ și $5$. Desigur, există mai multe moduri de a selecta elevii astfel încât să fie satisfăcută condiția de mai sus. Profesorul *Johnny* ar vrea să afle în câte moduri se poate face acest lucru.

# Cerinţă
Dându-se $N$ și înălțimile elevilor din clasă, aflați în câte moduri pot fi selectați oricâți elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive, astfel încât să fie îndeplinită condiția din enunț.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `leftmax.in` conține, pe prima linie, numărul $N$, iar pe a doua linie înălțimile elevilor în ordinea în care sunt așezați în linie.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `leftmax.out` conține pe prima linie răspunsul la cerință, sub formă de rest al împărțirii la $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ ($\text{modulo }1\ 000\ 000\ 007$).

# Restricţii și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Înălțimea oricărui elev este un număr întreg cuprins între $1$ și $N$, inclusiv.
- Dacă se selectează un număr impar de elevi, atunci considerăm că cel din mijlocul selecției se află în prima jumătate a elevilor selectați.
- Pentru 10 puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$ și elevii sunt ordonați descrescător după înălțime.
- Pentru alte 35 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru alte 20 de puncte, $N \leq 30\ 000$.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not take into account the case when the current element is the tallest element seen so far. In this case, the number of ways to select a subsequence ending at the current element is equal to the sum of the number of ways to select a subsequence ending at any of the previous elements.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    h = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

dp = [0] * n
dp[0] = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i):
        if h[j] > h[i]:
            dp[i] += dp[j]
    dp[i] += 1
    dp[i] %= 1000000007

with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(dp[n - 1]))
