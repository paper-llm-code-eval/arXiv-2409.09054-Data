Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `paranteze.in` and write to `paranteze.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Considerăm şiruri formate din paranteze de două tipuri: paranteze rotunde şi paranteze drepte. Parantezele se codifică în felul următor: paranteză rotundă deschisă cu $0$, paranteză rotundă închisă cu $1$, paranteză dreaptă deschisă cu $2$, paranteză dreaptă închisă cu $3$. Spre deosebire de convenţia uzuală din matematică, aici pot exista şi paranteze rotunde incluse în paranteze drepte şi paranteze drepte incluse în paranteze rotunde. Nu putem asocia unei paranteze rotunde deschise o paranteză dreaptă închisă sau viceversa.

# Cerință

Să se decidă dacă un astfel de şir este corect construit, în sensul că putem asocia corect două câte două parantezele de fiecare tip


# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `paranteze.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul $n$ (numărul de şiruri ale testului). 

Apoi pe fiecare din liniile $2, 3, \dots, n+1$ se află numerele $L \ c_1 \ c_2 \ \dots \ c_L$, numărul natural $L$ reprezintă lungimea unui şir de paranteze codificat conform enunţului. 

Valorile $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_L$ reprezintă codurile respective. Toate numerele sunt despărţite prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fişierului de ieșire `paranteze.out` se va scrie $n$ linii. Pe câte o linie va fi scris câte un mesaj. Pe fiecare linie se va scrie unul din mesajele `Da`, respectiv `Nu`, reprezentând rezultatele verificării corectitudinii şirurilor. Ordinea lor corespunde ordinii şirurilor din fişierul de intrare

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10$;
* Fiecare valoare $L$ îndeplineşte condiţia: $1 \leq L \leq 500$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open("paranteze.in", "r") as f_in, open("paranteze.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    for _ in range(n):
        l = int(f_in.readline())
        s = f_in.readline().split()
        stack = []
        ok = True
        for c in s:
            if c in "02":
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                if not stack or stack.pop() != str(int(c) - 1):
                    ok = False
                    break
        f_out.write("Da\n" if ok else "Nu\n")

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.
Implement a solution to fix the program

The error is caused by trying to convert the first line of the input file to an integer, which is actually a string containing the length of the first sequence and the sequence itself. To fix this, we need to read the first line and split it into two parts: the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. Here is the corrected code:

```python
with open("paranteze.in", "r") as f_in, open("paranteze.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    for _ in range(n):
        l, s = f_in.readline().split()
        l = int(l)
        stack = []
        ok = True
        for c in s:
            if c in "02":
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                if not stack or stack.pop() != str(int(c) - 1):
                    ok = False
                    break
        f_out.write("Da\n" if ok else "Nu\n")

The error is caused by trying to unpack the first line of the input file into two variables, `l` and `s`, when the line actually contains three values: the length of the sequence, the sequence itself, and a newline character. To fix this, we need to read the first line and split it into three parts: the length of the sequence, the sequence itself, and the newline character. Here is the corrected code:

```python
with open("paranteze.in", "r") as f_in, open("paranteze.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    for _ in range(n):

        stack = []
        ok = True
