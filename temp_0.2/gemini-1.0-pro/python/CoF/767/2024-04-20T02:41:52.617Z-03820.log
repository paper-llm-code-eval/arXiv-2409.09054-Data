Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `dreptc.in` and write to `dreptc.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră $N$ puncte colorate dispuse în plan. Ele sunt identificate prin coordontele lor întregi, pe axele OX și OY. Fiecare punct are asociat un număr natural între $1$ și $C$ reprezentând codul culorii lui. Un dreptunghi se numește *corect* dacă îndeplinește simultan următoarele condiții:

* toate cele patru vârfuri se regăsesc printre cele N puncte date;
* are laturile paralele cu axele OX, OY;
* are vârfurile colorate în aceeași culoare.

# Cerință

Să se determine numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri *corecte* care se pot forma cu cele $N$ puncte din plan.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.in` se găsesc două numere $N, MaxC$ reprezentând numărul de puncte din plan și numărul de culori asociate punctelor. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se citesc câte trei numere $x \ y \ c$ reprezentând în ordine coordonata pe axa OX (abscisa), coordonata pe axa OY (ordonata) și codul culorii asociate punctului.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.out` se va scrie un singur număr cu semnificația numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri corecte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq C \leq 5$;
* $-1 \ 000 \leq x, y \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Nu există două puncte cu aceleași coordonate
* $40$% din teste vor avea $N \leq 100$;
