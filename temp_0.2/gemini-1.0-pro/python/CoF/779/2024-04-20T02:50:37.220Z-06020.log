Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `turist.in` and write to `turist.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Harta unui continent poate fi văzută ca un dreptunghi având înălţimea de $M$ unităţi, iar lăţimea de $N$ unităţi. Colţul din stânga sus al hărţii are coordonatele ($0, 0$), iar colţul din dreapta jos are coordonatele ($M, N$). Coordonatele oraşelor de pe hartă sunt întotdeauna numere întregi, adică sunt de forma ($l, c$) cu $0 \leq l \leq M$, reprezentând  linia şi $0 \leq c \leq N$, reprezentând coloana. În unul din oraşele de pe hartă se găseşte un turist. El doreşte să pornească într-o expediţie deosebită. A decis să plece într-o anumită direcţie, şi să păstreze aceea direcţie pănă ajunge la marginea continentului (a hărţii) unde se încheie expediţia sa. Doreşte însă să aleagă acea direcţie care îl asigură că pe drumul său va trece prin cât mai multe oraşe.

# Cerință

Dându-se dimensiunile hărţii, coordonatele oraşului în care se găseşte turistul şi coordonatele tuturor celorlalte oraşe de pe hartă, se cere să se determine numărul maxim de oraşe pe care le va vizita turistul.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare `turist.in` se găsesc numerele naturale $M \ N$ separate printr-un spaţiu reprezentând dimensiunile hărţii. A doua linie a fişierului conţine două numere naturale $l$ şi $c$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând poziţia iniţială a turistului pe hartă. Linia a treia a fişierului conţine un număr natural $k$, reprezentând numărul de oraşele de pe hartă, diferite de oraşul în care se găseşte turistul. 

Pe următoarele $k$ linii se găsesc câte două numere naturale, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând coordonatele câte unui oraş de pe hartă, altele decât cel în care se găseşte turistul.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `turist.out` va avea pe prima sa linie, un număr natural reprezentând numărul maxim de oraşe pe care le vizitează turistul. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N, M \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 2 \ 000$;

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't take into account the starting position of the tourist. To fix this, we need to add the starting position to the count of cities visited.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open("turist.in", "r") as f:
    M, N = map(int, f.readline().split())
    l, c = map(int, f.readline().split())
    k = int(f.readline())
    cities = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
max_cities = 0

for direction in directions:
    dl, dc = direction
    cities_visited = 1  # Start with the current city
    while 0 <= l + dl < M and 0 <= c + dc < N:
        l += dl
        c += dc
        if (l, c) in cities:
            cities_visited += 1
    max_cities = max(max_cities, cities_visited)

with open("turist.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(max_cities))
```

Now, let's test the fixed solution with the given input:

I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. I have reviewed the code and identified the issue. The problem was that the code was not correctly handling the case where the tourist starts at the edge of the map.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open("turist.in", "r") as f:
    M, N = map(int, f.readline().split())
    l, c = map(int, f.readline().split())
    k = int(f.readline())
    cities = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

    # Check if the tourist starts at the edge of the map
    max_cities = 1  # Start with the current city
    if l == 0 or l == M - 1 or c == 0 or c == N - 1:
        max_cities += 1  # Add one more city if the tourist starts at the edge

    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

    for direction in directions:
        dl, dc = direction
        cities_visited = 0
        while 0 <= l + dl < M and 0 <= c + dc < N:
            l += dl
            c += dc
            if (l, c) in cities:
                cities_visited += 1
        max_cities = max(max_cities, cities_visited + 1)  # Add one more city for the current direction

    with open("turist.out", "w") as f:
