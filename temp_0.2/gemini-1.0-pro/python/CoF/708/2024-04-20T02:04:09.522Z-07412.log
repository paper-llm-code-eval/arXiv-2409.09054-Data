Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `anagrame.in` and write to `anagrame.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un cuvânt format numai din litere mici. Numim anagramă un cuvânt format din literele cuvântului dat, schimbând eventual ordinea literelor. De exemplu o anagramă a cuvântului tamara este cuvântul armata. Evident, un cuvânt poate fi considerat o anagramă a lui însuşi.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să genereze toate anagramele unui cuvânt dat, în ordine lexicografică.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `anagrame.in` conţine pe prima linie cuvântul dat.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `anagrame.out` va conţine în ordine anagramele cuvântului dat, câte una pe linie.

# Restricții și precizări

* Cuvântul dat are cel mult $10$ litere mici.
* Cuvântul $x = x_1 \ x_2 \dots x_n$ precede cuvântul $y = y_1 \ y_2 \dots y_n$ dacă există un indice $k \in {1, 2, \dots, n}$ astfel încât $x_i = y_i$, $i \in {1, 2, \dots, k - 1}$, iar litera $x_k$ precede în alfabet litera $y_k$.

Example:
`anagrame.in`
```
ana
```

`anagrame.out`
```
aan
ana
naa
```

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
ana
```
Expected output:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The provided solution is correct, but it doesn't print the anagrams in the correct order.
To fix this, we can use a stack to store the anagrams and print them in reverse order.
Here is the fixed solution:

```python
def anagrame(cuv, k):
    if k == len(cuv):
        stack.append(''.join(cuv))
    else:
        for i in range(k, len(cuv)):
            cuv[k], cuv[i] = cuv[i], cuv[k]
            anagrame(cuv, k + 1)
            cuv[k], cuv[i] = cuv[i], cuv[k]

with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as f:
    cuv = list(f.readline().strip())
cuv.sort()
stack = []
anagrame(cuv, 0)
with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as f:
    while stack:
        f.write(stack.pop() + '\n')
```

The issue with the previous solution is that it generates duplicate anagrams.
To fix this, we can use a set to store the generated anagrams and only add an anagram to the set if it is not already present.
Here is the fixed solution:

```python
def anagrame(cuv, k):
    if k == len(cuv):
        if ''.join(cuv) not in seen:
            seen.add(''.join(cuv))
            stack.append(''.join(cuv))
    else:
        for i in range(k, len(cuv)):
            cuv[k], cuv[i] = cuv[i], cuv[k]
            anagrame(cuv, k + 1)
            cuv[k], cuv[i] = cuv[i], cuv[k]

with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as f:
    cuv = list(f.readline().strip())
cuv.sort()
stack = []
seen = set()
anagrame(cuv, 0)
with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as f:
    while stack:
        f.write(stack.pop() + '\n')
