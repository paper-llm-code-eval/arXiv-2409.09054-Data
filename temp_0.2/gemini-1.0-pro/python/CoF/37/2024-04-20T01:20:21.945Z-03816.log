Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `blis.in` and write to `blis.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un şir de biţi şi un număr natural `K`. Şirul se împarte în secvenţe astfel încât fiecare bit din şir să aparţină unei singure secvenţe şi fiecare secvenţă să aibă lungimea cel puţin `1` şi cel mult `K`. După împărţire, fiecare secvenţă de biţi se converteşte în baza `10`, obţinându-se un şir de valori zecimale. De exemplu, pentru şirul de biţi `1001110111101010011` şi `K = 4`, se poate obţine `1 0011 101 111 0 1010 011`, apoi în baza `10`: `1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 10, 3`. O altă împărţire poate fi `1 00 1 1 10 11 110 1010 011`, adică `1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 3`.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care:
* determină valoarea maximă (în baza `10`) care se poate obţine dintr-o secvenţă de cel mult `K` biţi
* împarte şirul iniţial în secvenţe de cel mult `K` biţi astfel încât şirul zecimal obţinut să conţină un subşir strict crescător de lungime maximă posibilă.

# Date de intrare
Prima linie a fişierului de intrare `blis.in` conţine numărul natural `K`, iar pe linia a doua se află şirul de biţi, şirul neconţinând spaţii.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `blis.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând valoarea maximă care se poate obţine dintr-o secvenţă de cel mult `K` biţi, iar pe linia a doua un singur număr natural reprezentând lungimea maximă a subşirului strict crescător care se poate obţine din şirul de biţi prin împărţirea sa în secvenţe de cel mult `K` biţi.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* `3 ≤ lungimea şirului de biţi ≤ 100 000`
* pentru `70%` din teste, `lungimea şirului de biţi ≤ 1000`
* `1 ≤ K ≤ 30`
* Un subşir se obţine dintr-un şir prin eliminarea a zero, unul, două sau mai multe elemente;
* O secvenţă este formată din elemente aflate pe poziţii consecutive în şir;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerinţe se acordă `20%` din punctaj, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de-a doua se acordă `80%`.

The error is caused by the negative shift count in the line:
```python
dp[j][i] = max(dp[j][i + 1], dp[j - 1][i + 1] + (s[i] == '1') * (1 << (j - 1)))
```
To fix it, we need to make sure that the shift count is always non-negative. We can do this by using the `max` function to ensure that the shift count is always at least 0:
```python
dp[j][i] = max(dp[j][i + 1], dp[j - 1][i + 1] + (s[i] == '1') * (1 << max(j - 1, 0)))
```

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('blis.in', 'r') as f:
    k = int(f.readline())
    s = f.readline().strip()

n = len(s)
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(k + 1):
        dp[j][i] = max(dp[j][i + 1], dp[j - 1][i + 1] + (s[i] == '1') * (1 << max(j - 1, 0)))

with open('blis.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{dp[k][0]}\n')
    
    j = k
    i = 0
    ans = []
    while j > 0:
        if dp[j][i] == dp[j - 1][i + 1] + (s[i] == '1') * (1 << max(j - 1, 0)):
            ans.append(i)
            j -= 1
        i += 1
    
    f.write(f'{len(ans)}\n')

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result is incorrect. The expected result is 15, which is the maximum value that can be obtained from a sequence of at most 4 bits. The found result is 52, which is incorrect.

The reason for the incorrect result is that the code does not correctly handle the case where the maximum value is obtained from a sequence of less than 4 bits. In this case, the code should still output the maximum value, but it instead outputs the sum of the values of all the sequences.

Here is a fixed version of the code:
```python
with open('blis.in', 'r') as f:
    k = int(f.readline())
    s = f.readline().strip()

n = len(s)
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(k + 1):
        dp[j][i] = max(dp[j][i + 1], dp[j - 1][i + 1] + (s[i] == '1') * (1 << max(j - 1, 0)))

max_value = dp[k][0]
if max_value > (1 << k) - 1:
    max_value = (1 << k) - 1

with open('blis.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{max_value}\n')
    
    j = k
    i = 0
    ans = []

            j -= 1

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result is incorrect. The expected result is 6, which is the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence that can be obtained from the given string. The found result is 4, which is incorrect.

The reason for the incorrect result is that the code does not correctly handle the case where the longest strictly increasing subsequence is not obtained from a contiguous subsequence of the given string. In this case, the code should still output the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence, but it instead outputs the length of the longest contiguous subsequence.

Here is a fixed version of the code:

with open('blis.in', 'r') as f:
