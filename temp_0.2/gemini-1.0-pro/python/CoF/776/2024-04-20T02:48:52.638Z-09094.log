Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `culori.in` and write to `culori.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Într-o cameră sunt aşezate $n \cdot m$ acvarii identice, pe $n$ rânduri, câte $m$ pe fiecare rând, unul lângă altul. În fiecare acvariu se află un singur peşte. Peştele poate fi de culoare roşie (culoare codificată cu $r$) sau albastră (codificată cu $a$). La fiecare moment de timp $t = 1,2,3,\dots$, peştii îşi modifică simultan culoarea astfel: fiecare peşte se colorează în culoarea pe care au avut-o la momentul $t-1$ majoritatea peştilor din acvariile învecinate (ca în desenul alăturat, sunt cel mult $8$ acvarii vecine notate cu $V_1,V_2,V_3,\dots,V_8$). În cazul în care numărul peştilor vecini roşii este egal cu numărul peştilor vecini albaştri, peştele studiat îşi va păstra culoarea.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să citească numerele naturale $n,m,t$ şi cele $n \cdot m$ coduri ale culorilor peştilor (cele de la momentul iniţial $t=0$) şi care să determine şi să afişeze codurile culorilor peştilor de la momentul $t$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `culori.in` contine:

- pe prima linie numerele naturale $n \ m$ şi $t$, separate printr-un singur spaţiu, cu semnificaţia:
	- $n =$ numărul de rânduri pe care sunt aşezate acvariile
	- $m =$ numărul de coloane pe care sunt aşezate acvariile
	- $t =$ momentul de timp
- pe următoarele $n$ linii se află câte $m$ caractere $r$ sau $a$, pentru fiecare rând de acvarii, obţinute astfel:
	- dacă peştele din acvariul cu numărul de ordine $i$ din rândul curent este roşu, atunci cel de-al $i$-lea caracter din linia fişierului de intrare, corespunzătoare rândului curent, este `r`
	- dacă peştele din acvariul cu numărul de ordine $i$ din rândul curent este albastru atunci cel de-al $i$-lea caracter din linia fişierului de intrare, corespunzătoare rândului curent, este `a`


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `culori.out` va conţine $n$ linii, fiecare linie va conţine câte $m$ caractere $r$ sau $a$, reprezentând codurile culorilor peştilor din rândul corespunzător numărului liniei curente din fişier

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 50$
* $2 \leq m \leq 50$
* $1 \leq t \leq 2 \ 300 \ 000$

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the number of red and blue neighbors is equal to 4. In this case, the color of the cell should remain the same as in the previous iteration.

Here is a fixed version of the code:
