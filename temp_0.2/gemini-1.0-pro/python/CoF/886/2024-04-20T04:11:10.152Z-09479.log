Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `triunghiuri.in` and write to `triunghiuri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră $N$ puncte din plan, având coordonate numere naturale, relativ la un reper cartezian XOY, oricare două puncte fiind distincte.

~[triunghiuri.png]

# Cerință

Cunoscând $N$ și coordonatele celor $N$ puncte, să se determine:

1. Numărul maxim de puncte care au aceeași abscisă.
2. Numărul triunghiurilor care se pot desena respectând următoarele condiții:
	* au toate vârfurile în puncte dintre cele date;
	* au o latură paralelă cu OX;
	* **nu** au laturi paralele cu OY;

# Date de intrare

Datele de intrare se citesc din fișierul `triunghiuri.in`, care are următoarea structură:

Pe prima linie se află numărul $p$, care indică cerința ce trebuie rezolvată ($p$ are valoarea $1$ sau $2$);
Pe a doua linie se află numărul natural $N$, reprezentând numărul punctelor date;
Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsesc câte două valori naturale $x \ y$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctelor date.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `triunghiuri.out` va avea următoarea structură:

Dacă $p = 1$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul maxim de puncte care au aceeași abscisă (cerința $1$).
Dacă $p = 2$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul triunghiurilor care se pot desena respectând condițiile date, modulo $1 \ 000 \ 003$, adică restul împărțirii numărului de triunghiuri la $1 \ 000 \ 003$ (cerința $2$).

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq x, y \leq 1 000$;
* Se acordă $25$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ și $65$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The bug in the previous solution was in the condition `if x1 <= x2 and x2 <= x3 and x3 <= x3 and x3 <= x3`. It should have been `if x1 <= x2 and x2 <= x3 and x3 <= x3 and x3 <= x3 and x3 <= x3`.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
import sys

def main():
    with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as f_in, open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as f_out:
        p = int(f_in.readline())
        n = int(f_in.readline())
        points = []
        for _ in range(n):
            x, y = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
            points.append((x, y))

        if p == 1:
            max_x = 0
            for x, _ in points:
                max_x = max(max_x, x)
            count = 0
            for x, _ in points:
                if x == max_x:
                    count += 1
            f_out.write(str(count) + '\n')
        elif p == 2:
            points.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])
            count = 0
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    for k in range(j + 1, n):
                        x1, y1 = points[i]
                        x2, y2 = points[j]
                        x3, y3 = points[k]
                        if y1 == y2 and y2 == y3:
                            continue
                        if y1 > y2:
                            x1, y1, x2, y2 = x2, y2, x1, y1
                        if y2 > y3:
                            x2, y2, x3, y3 = x3, y3, x2, y2
                        if y1 == y2 or y2 == y3:
                            continue
                        if x1 <= x2 and x2 <= x3 and x3 <= x3 and x3 <= x3 and x3 <= x3:
                            count += 1
            f_out.write(str(count % 1000003) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
