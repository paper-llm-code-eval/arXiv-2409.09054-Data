Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `siruri.in` and write to `siruri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un vector unidimensional $x$ cu $n$ componente numere naturale distincte, cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să construiască vectorul $y$ cu elemente din mulțimea $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ astfel încât oricare ar fi numerele naturale $i, j$ cu proprietatea că $1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq j \leq n$ și $x_i < x_j$ să avem $y_i < y_j$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `siruri.in` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul $n$
* pe linia a doua componentele vectorului $x$ separate prin câte un spațiu

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `siruri.out` va conține pe prima linie componentele vectorului $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* Componentele vectorului x sunt numere naturale cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open('siruri.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    x = [int(i) for i in f.readline().split()]

y = [0] * n
rank = [0] * 32001

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            rank[x[i]] |= (1 << j)

for i in range(1, 32001):

The error in the previous solution was that it did not correctly handle the case when multiple elements in the input array had the same value. This caused the `rank` array to be updated incorrectly, which in turn led to incorrect values being assigned to the `y` array.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:
```python
with open('siruri.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    x = [int(i) for i in f.readline().split()]

y = [0] * n
rank = [0] * 32001

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(32):
        if x[i] & (1 << j):
            rank[x[i]] |= (1 << j)

for i in range(1, 32001):
    rank[i] |= rank[i - 1]

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(32):
        if not (rank[x[i]] & (1 << j)):
            y[i] = j + 1
            # Update the rank of all elements that are greater than or equal to x[i]
            for k in range(x[i], 32001):
                rank[k] |= (1 << j)
            break

with open('siruri.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(' '.join(map(str, y)))
```

This solution correctly handles the case when multiple elements in the input array have the same value by updating the `rank` array for all elements that are greater than or equal to the current element. This ensures that the `y` array is assigned the correct values.
