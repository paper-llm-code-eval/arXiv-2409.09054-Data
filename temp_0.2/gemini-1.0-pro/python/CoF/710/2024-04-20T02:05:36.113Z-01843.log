Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cod.in` and write to `cod.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Principala misiune a unei expediții stiintifice este de a studia evoluția vieții pe o planetă nou descoperită. În urma studiilor efectuate, cercetătorii au asociat fiecărui organism viu descoperit pe acea planetă un cod caracteristic. Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

De asemenea, cercetătorii au observat că pentru orice organism viu de pe planetă, codurile caracteristice ale strămoșilor săi pe scara evoluției se pot obține prin ștergerea unor cifre din codul caracteristic al organismului respectiv, iar un organism este cu atât mai evoluat cu cât codul său caracteristic are o valoare mai mare.

# Cerință

Date fiind codurile caracteristice ale două organisme vii diferite, scrieți un program care să determine codul caracteristic al celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lor.


# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține:

* $n$ - codul caracteristic al primului organism
* $m$ - codul caracteristic al celui de-al doilea organism

# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` conține pe prima linie:

* $p$ – codul celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lui $n$ si $m$

# Restricții și precizări

* Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

Example:
`cod.in`
```

```

`cod.out`
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open('cod.in', 'r') as f:
    n = f.readline().strip()
    m = f.readline().strip()

lcs = ""
i = len(n) - 1
j = len(m) - 1

while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
    if n[i] == m[j]:
        lcs = n[i] + lcs
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        if n[i] > m[j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```

Expected output:
```

Found output:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The issue with the previous solution is that it finds the longest common subsequence instead of the longest common prefix. To fix this, we can simply stop the loop when we find a mismatch between the characters of the two strings.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('cod.in', 'r') as f:
    n = f.readline().strip()
    m = f.readline().strip()

lcp = ""
i = len(n) - 1
j = len(m) - 1

while i >= 0 and j >= 0 and n[i] == m[j]:
    lcp = n[i] + lcp
    i -= 1
    j -= 1

with open('cod.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(lcp)
```

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't handle the case when the two strings have different lengths. In this case, the loop will continue to iterate over the shorter string, even though there are no more characters to compare. This can lead to incorrect results, as seen in the example you provided.

To fix this, we can add a check to make sure that the two strings have the same length before entering the loop. If they don't have the same length, we can simply return an empty string.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('cod.in', 'r') as f:
    n = f.readline().strip()
    m = f.readline().strip()

if len(n) != len(m):
    with open('cod.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write('')
    exit()

lcp = ""
i = len(n) - 1
j = len(m) - 1

while i >= 0 and j >= 0 and n[i] == m[j]:
    lcp = n[i] + lcp
    i -= 1
    j -= 1

with open('cod.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(lcp)

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't handle the case when the two strings are empty. In this case, the loop will never be entered, and an empty string will be returned. This is incorrect, as the longest common prefix of two empty strings is also an empty string.

To fix this, we can simply add a check to make sure that at least one of the strings is non-empty before entering the loop. If both strings are empty, we can simply return an empty string.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('cod.in', 'r') as f:
    n = f.readline().strip()
    m = f.readline().strip()

if not n or not m:
    with open('cod.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write('')
