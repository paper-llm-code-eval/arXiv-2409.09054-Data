Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `turnuri.in` and write to `turnuri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Într-un tablou bidimensional de dimensiuni date $m$ (numărul de linii) şi $n$ (numărul de coloane) există în fiecare celulă o valoare $0$ sau $1$. Un turn este format numai din valori $1$ vecine, de pe aceeaşi coloană, numărul acestor valori egale cu $1$ reprezentând înălţimea turnului. Se consideră că pe o coloană nu există alte valori egale cu 1 în afara celor care intră în componenţa unui turn.

Fiecare coloană poate conţine câte un singur turn. Dacă o coloană are numai valori $0$, se consideră totuşi că acea coloană conţine un turn de înălţime $0$. Dacă o coloană are una sau mai multe valori $1$, atunci una dintre ele este obligatoriu plasată pe ultima linie.

Luând pe rând toate perechile formate din câte $2$ turnuri aflate pe coloane vecine, este posibilă următoarea operaţie de reconfigurare: din $2$ turnuri de înălţime nenulă, de pe $2$ coloane vecine se poate forma un nou turn cu înălţimea egală cu suma celor două. Dorim astfel să obţinem în final numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă. Există însă două condiţii care trebuie respectate:
- înălţimea noului turn format nu poate depăşi valoarea $m$ (numărul de linii ale tabloului);
- orice turn care a contribuit la formarea unui turn de înălţime maximă nu mai poate contribui şi la formarea unui alt turn de înălţime maximă.

Operaţia de reconfigurare se efectuează o singură dată.

# Cerință

Dându-se tabloul bidimensional cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane cu valori $0$ şi $1$, se cere:

1. Să se afişeze înălţimile turnurilor din configuraţia iniţială, precizându-se şi turnurile cu înălţime $0$, începând cu cel mai din stânga turn
2. Să se afişeze înălţimea maximă a turnurilor rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare
3. Să se afişeze numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă, rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `turnuri.in` va conţine:

- pe prima linie din fişier se află numărul natural $m$ care reprezintă numărul de linii şi numărul natural $n$ care reprezintă numărul de coloane, valori separate între ele printr-un spaţiu
- pe următoarele $m$ linii câte n valori $0$ sau $1$, separate două câte două printr-un spaţiu

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `turnuri.out` va conţine trei linii:

- pe prima linie se află înălţimile iniţiale ale turnurilor, valori separate două câte două printr-un spaţiu
- pe a doua linie se află înălţimea maximă a turnurilor rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare
- pe a treia linie se află numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă, rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m, n \leq 1 \ 000$; 
* Testele si restricțiile au fost refăcute pentru standardele anului $2023$
* Se acordă punctaje parţiale: cerinţa a) $40$% din punctaj, cerinţa b) $40$% din punctaj, cerinţa c) $20$%.
* Toate turnurile incep de pe ultima linie a matricii.

The bug in the previous solution was that it did not correctly handle the case where the maximum height of the towers after the reconfiguration was greater than the number of rows in the grid. This caused the solution to output an incorrect maximum height and maximum number of towers of maximum height.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open("turnuri.in", "r") as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Calculate the heights of the initial towers
heights = [0] * n
for j in range(n):
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            heights[j] += 1

# Find the maximum height of the towers after the reconfiguration
max_height = 0
for j in range(n - 1):
    if heights[j] > 0 and heights[j + 1] > 0:
        max_height = max(max_height, min(heights[j] + heights[j + 1], m))

# Find the maximum number of towers of maximum height
max_count = 0
for j in range(n - 1):
    if heights[j] > 0 and heights[j + 1] > 0 and heights[j] + heights[j + 1] == max_height:
        max_count += 1

# Write the output to the file
with open("turnuri.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(" ".join(map(str, heights)) + "\n")
    f.write(str(max_height) + "\n")
    f.write(str(max_count) + "\n")
