Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `scara.in` and write to `scara.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Ion şi-a construit o vilă pe frumosul vârf al unui munte. Acum proiectează o scară specială, pe care va urca de la şosea până la vilă. Diferenţa de nivel dintre şosea şi vilă este $H$ (deci aceasta trebuie să fie înălţimea totală a scării). Scara va avea $N$ trepte, toate de aceeaşi lăţime, dar de înălţimi distincte două câte două.

Ion a sesizat că efortul pe care îl depune pentru a urca o treaptă este egal cu înălţimea treptei. Dar dacă el urcă $x$ trepte deodată, efortul depus este egal cu media aritmetică a înălţimilor acestor $x$ trepte pe care le urcă deodată + un efort de valoare constantă $p$ (necesar pentru a-şi lua avânt). 

Fiind un tip atletic, Ion poate urca mai multe trepte deodată, dar suma înălţimilor treptelor urcate deodată nu trebuie să depăşească o valoare maximă $M$.

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine efortul minim necesar pentru a urca pe o scară construită conform restricţiilor problemei, precum şi o modalitate de a construi scara care va fi urcată cu efort minim.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `scara.in` va conţine pe prima linie $4$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu $H \ N \ M \ p$ (cu semnificaţia din enunţ).

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `scara.out` va conţine 
- pe prima linie va fi scris efortul minim necesar (cu $2$ zecimale cu rotunjire);
- pe cea de a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale nenule care reprezintă înălţimile celor $N$ trepte ale scării (în ordinea de la şosea către vilă), separate prin câte un spaţiu. 


# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < H \leq 75$
* $0 < N \leq 8$
* $0 < M < 14$
* $0 \leq p \leq 10$
* Pentru datele de test, problema are întodeauna soluţie. 
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii (modalităţi de a construi scara astfel încât să obţineţi efortul minim dorit), veţi afişa prima soluţie în ordine lexicografică.
* Spunem că vectorul $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_k)$ precedă în ordine lexicografică vectorul $y=(y_1, y_2, ..., y_k)$ dacă există $i \geq 1$ astfel încât $x_j=y_j$, pentru orice $j<i$ şi $x_i<y_i$.
* Dacă a doua zecimală a efortului minim este $0$, sau chiar ambele zecimale sunt $0$ nu este necesar să le afişaţi. Deci în exemplu s-ar fi putut scrie efortul minim $9$ sau $9.0$.
* Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru prima cerinţă (efortul minim).
* Dacă efortul minim este corect şi se afişează şi o soluţie corectă (care respectă restricţiile problemei şi corespunde efortului minim), dar această soluţie nu este prima din punct de vedere lexicografic, se obţine $80\%$ din punctaj. Pentru rezolvarea corectă şi completă a ambelor cerinţe se obţine $100\%$ din punctaj.

Example:
`scara.in`
```
10 4 5 2
```

`scara.out`
```
9.00
1 4 2 3

The error is caused by the fact that the `memo` table is initialized with `-1` values, but the first index of each dimension is `0`. This means that when the function tries to access `memo[i][j][height][steps]`, it is actually trying to access `memo[-1][j][height][steps]`, which is out of range.

To fix the issue, we need to initialize the `memo` table with `0` values instead of `-1` values. Here is the corrected code:

The error is caused by the fact that the `memo` table is initialized with `-1` values, but the first index of each dimension is `0`. This means that when the function tries to access `memo[i][j][height][steps]`, it is actually trying to access `memo[-1][j][height][steps]`, which is out of range.

To fix the issue, we need to initialize the `memo` table with `0` values instead of `-1` values. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    with open('scara.in', 'r') as f:
        h, n, m, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

    # Initialize the memoization table
    memo = [[[[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(h + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Define the recursive function to calculate the minimum effort
    def min_effort(i, j, height, steps):
        # Base case: we have reached the top of the stairs
        if i == n:
            return 0

        # Base case: we have used all the steps
        if j == 0:
            return sys.maxsize

        # Check if the subproblem has already been solved
        if memo[i][j][height][steps] != 0:
            return memo[i][j][height][steps]

        # Try all possible heights for the next step
        min_effort_so_far = sys.maxsize
        for next_height in range(1, m + 1):
            # Calculate the effort for the next step
            effort = (height + next_height) / 2 + p

            # Recursively calculate the minimum effort for the remaining steps
            min_effort_so_far = min(min_effort_so_far, effort + min_effort(i + 1, j - 1, next_height, steps))

        # Store the minimum effort for the subproblem
        memo[i][j][height][steps] = min_effort_so_far

        return min_effort_so_far

    # Find the minimum effort and the corresponding sequence of heights
    min_effort = min_effort(0, n, 0, h)
    heights = []

    i = 0
    j = n
    height = 0
    steps = h
    while i != n:
        # Try all possible heights for the next step
        for next_height in range(1, m + 1):
            # Calculate the effort for the next step
            effort = (height + next_height) / 2 + p

            # Check if this is the step that leads to the minimum effort
            if effort + min_effort(i + 1, j - 1, next_height, steps) == min_effort:
                heights.append(next_height)
                i += 1
                j -= 1
                height = next_height
                steps -= next_height
                break

    # Write the output to the file
    with open('scara.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, heights)))

if __name__ == '__main__':
