Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `magic.in` and write to `magic.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Rămaşi singuri în pădure, Hansel şi Grettel, ştiu că singura lor şansă de supravieţuire este să găsească şi să intre în Castelul de Turtă Dulce. Poarta castelului este închisă şi pentru a intra este nevoie de un cuvânt magic şi de un număr fermecat.

Zâna cea Bună îi vede pe copii şi pentru că vrea să–i ajute le spune:
„Mergeţi tot înainte, iar în drumul vostru o să întâlniţi copaci pe a căror trunchiuri sunt scrise caractere reprezentând litere sau cifre. Cuvântul magic este format din toate caracterele literă în ordinea în care apar, dar scrise toate cu majuscule. Numărul fermecat este cel mai mic număr cu cifre distincte care se poate forma din caracterele cifră.”

# Cerință

Pentru a-i ajuta pe Hansel şi Grettel să intre în Castelul de Turtă Dulce, scrieţi un program care citeşte un număr natural $n$, apoi $n$ caractere şi determină:

* cuvântul magic;
* numărul fermecat;

# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `magic.in` se găseste un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de caractere scrise pe copaci. Pe cea de a doua linie sunt $n$ caractere separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând caracterele scrise pe copaci.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `magic.out` va conține două linii:

* pe prima linie se va scrie un şir de litere mari, reprezentând cuvântul magic;
* pe a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural cu cifre distincte, reprezentând numărul fermecat.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Caracterele sunt doar cifre sau litere mici ale alfabetului englez.
* Printre cele $n$ caractere se află întotdeauna cel puțin o literă şi cel puţin o cifră.
* Pe fiecare copac este scris un singur caracter.
* Numărul magic începe întotdeauna cu o cifră diferită de zero.
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă 40% din punctaj, pentru cerinţa b) 60% din punctaj.

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result has the characters in the magic word in the wrong order. The correct order should be `CB` instead of `BC`.

The reason for this is that the code sorts the characters in the list `chars` before joining them to form the magic word. However, the sorting algorithm sorts the characters in ascending order, which means that the characters `B` and `C` are swapped.

To fix this, we can use the `sorted()` function with the `key` argument to sort the characters in the order we want. The following code will sort the characters in descending order, which will give us the correct magic word:

```python
magic_word = "".join([ch for ch in sorted(chars, key=lambda x: x.upper(), reverse=True) if ch.isalpha()]).upper()
```

Here is the complete fixed code:

```python
with open("magic.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    chars = f.readline().split()

chars.sort()
magic_word = "".join([ch for ch in sorted(chars, key=lambda x: x.upper(), reverse=True) if ch.isalpha()]).upper()
magic_number = "".join(sorted(list(set([ch for ch in chars if ch.isdigit()]))))

with open("magic.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(magic_word + "\n")
    f.write(magic_number + "\n")

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result has the characters in the magic word in the wrong order and the digits in the magic number are not in ascending order.

The reason for the wrong order of the characters in the magic word is the same as in the previous case: the code sorts the characters in ascending order, which means that the characters `B`, `C`, and `D` are swapped.

The reason for the wrong order of the digits in the magic number is that the code sorts the digits in ascending order, which means that the digits `0`, `2`, and `5` are swapped.

To fix both of these issues, we can use the `sorted()` function with the `key` argument to sort the characters and digits in the order we want. The following code will sort the characters in descending order and the digits in ascending order:

```python
magic_word = "".join([ch for ch in sorted(chars, key=lambda x: x.upper(), reverse=True) if ch.isalpha()]).upper()
magic_number = "".join(sorted(list(set([ch for ch in chars if ch.isdigit()]))))
```

magic_number = "".join(sorted(list(set([ch for ch in chars if ch.isdigit()]))))

with open("magic.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(magic_word + "\n")
    f.write(magic_number + "\n")
