Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `zona.in` and write to `zona.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Ionuţ pleacă în drumeţie într-o porţiune de teren de formă pătratică cu latura de $N$ metri. O hartă a zonei are trasat un caroiaj care împarte zona în $N \cdot N$ pătrate unitate, cu latura de $1$ metru. Astfel harta zonei are aspectul unui tablou pătratic cu $N$ linii şi $N$ coloane. Liniile şi coloanele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $N$. Elementele tabloului bidimensional corespund pătratelor unitate. Zona poate fi parcursă străbătând oricare dintre laturile pătratelor unitate **cel mult o singură dată**.

~[55bdc2f5c84ca3f4b5a80867350d0328.png]

Ionuţ pleacă din punctul aflat în colţul din dreapta jos al pătratului unitate din linia $X$, coloana $Y$ şi se deplasează făcând **un pas** (parcurgând o latură a unui pătrat unitate) în una din direcţiile $Nord$, $Est$, $Sud$, $Vest$. Pentru a reţine mai uşor traseul foloseşte următoarea codificare pentru cele $4$ direcţii: $1$ pentru deplasarea spre $Nord$, $2$ pentru deplasarea spre $Est$, $3$ pentru deplasarea spre $Sud$, respectiv $4$ pentru deplasarea spre $Vest$. Ajuns într-alt punct (colţ de pătrat unitate), Ionuţ continuă să se deplaseze fără a trece de mai multe ori pe aceeaşi latură a unui pătrat unitate. 

Ionuţ se opreşte în momentul în care ajunge într-un punct prin care a mai trecut. Traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct delimitează o zonă de teren formată din pătrate unitate.

# Cerinţă

Dându-se linia $X$ şi coloana $Y$ corespunzătoare poziţiei de plecare a lui Ionuţ, dimensiunea zonei $N$, lungimea traseului $L$ şi traseul determinaţi:

$a)$ Numărul de paşi parcurşi între prima şi a doua trecere prin punctul de oprire.
$b)$ Numărul de pătrate unitate interioare zonei delimitată de traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct.  


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `zona.in` se află valorile $X$, $Y$, $N$ şi $L$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctului de plecare, dimensiunea terenului şi lungimea traseului parcurs. Pe următoarea linie se află $L$ valori din mulţimea $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând codificarea întregului traseu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `zona.out` va conţine **două** linii, pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $a)$, iar pe linia a doua, un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < N < 51$
* $0 < X, Y < N$
* $0 < L < 2501$
* Se garantează faptul că traseul trece de două ori prin acelaşi punct şi nu parcurge de două ori aceeaşi latură.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $a)$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $b)$ se acordă $80\%$ din punctaj.

The bug in the previous solution was that it did not correctly handle the case when the first and last occurrences of the starting position were in the same row or column. This caused the `steps_between` variable to be calculated incorrectly.
