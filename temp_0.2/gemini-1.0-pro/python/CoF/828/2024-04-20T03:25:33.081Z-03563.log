Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `culori.in` and write to `culori.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Pasiunea Mirunei este să coloreze. Vacanţa trecută şi-a petrecut-o la bunica ei la ţară şi pentru că se cam plictisea s-a gândit să vopsească gardul de la casa bunicii.

Gardul este compus din $N$ scânduri dispuse una lângă alta. Miruna a găsit în garajul bunicii $5$ cutii de vopsea de culori diferite: **albă**, **albastră**, **roşie**, **verde** şi **galbenă**. Când a vopsit gardul, Miruna a respectat următoarele reguli:
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **alb**, următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **albastru**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **albastru**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **alb** sau **roşu**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **roşu**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **albastru** sau **verde**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **verde**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **roșu** sau **galben**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **galben**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **verde**

După ce a și-a terminat treaba Miruna își admira “opera de artă” și se întreba în câte moduri diferite ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii. 

# Cerinţă

Ajutați-o pe Miruna să găsească răspunsul la întrebarea sa.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul `culori.in` conţine pe prima sa linie un singur număr natural $N$.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `culori.out` va conţine pe prima sa linie un singur număr întreg reprezentând numărul de moduri diferite în care Miruna ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 5 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25\%$ dintre teste $N \leq 45$.

```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open('culori.in') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
with open('culori.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(2 ** (n - 1)))
```
---------- user ----------


Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
4
```
Expected output:
```
24
```
Found output:
```
8
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not take into account the fact that the first plank can be painted in 5 different ways. The corrected solution is:

```python
with open('culori.in') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
with open('culori.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(5 * (2 ** (n - 1))))

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not take into account the fact that the last plank can only be painted in 3 different ways (white, blue, or green). The corrected solution is:

    n = int(f.readline())
with open('culori.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(5 * (2 ** (n - 2)) * 3))
