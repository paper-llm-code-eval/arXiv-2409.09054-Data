Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `parc.in` and write to `parc.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un parc de formă dreptunghiulară este format din zone pietonale şi piste de biciclete. Reprezentând harta parcului într-un sistem cartezian, cu coordonata colţului stânga-jos `(0,0)`, pistele de biciclete sunt reprezentate prin dungi orizontale sau verticale colorate cu gri, iar zonele pietonale au culoarea albă, ca în figura din dreapta.

Vizitatorii parcului se pot plimba liber pe zonele pietonale în orice direcţie, însă pistele de biciclete se vor traversa, în linie dreaptă,  paralel cu axele. În figura alăturată avem un parc de dimensiuni `10 x 8`, cu piste de biciclete verticale între `2` şi `4` respectiv `5` şi `8`, şi  orizontale între `0` şi `1` respectiv între `2` şi `4`. Gigel se află în punctul `A(1 , 1)` şi poate sa ajungă pe drumul cel mai scurt la prietenul lui, în punctul `B(8 , 7)` deplasându-se astfel: porneşte din punctul `(1, 1)` şi parcurge un traseu format din segmente cu extremităţile în punctele de coordonate `(1.5 , 2) (1.5, 4) (2 , 5) (4 , 5) (5 , 7)` şi în final ajunge în punctul de coordonate `(8 , 7)`. 

Lungimea totală a drumului va fi aproximativ `11.4721359`.
\
~[parc.png]
# Cerinţă
Cunoscând dimensiunile parcului, coordonatele lui Gigel, coordonatele prietenului lui şi poziţiile pistelor de biciclete, să se calculeze lungimea drumului minim şi numărul drumurilor distincte de lungime minimă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `parc.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale `Xparc` şi `Yparc` separate prin spaţiu, reprezentând dimensiunile parcului în direcţiile `Ox` respectiv `Oy`. Linia a doua va conţine patru numere separate prin spaţiu `xG, yG, xpr` şi `ypr` ce reprezintă coordonatele lui Gigel şi coordonatele prietenului lui. Linia a treia va conţine un număr natural `m`, reprezentând numărul pistelor verticale. Următoarele `m` linii vor conţine perechi de valori de pe axa `Ox` ce delimitează câte o pistă de biciclete verticală. Următoarea linie va conţine un număr natural `n`, reprezentând numărul pistelor orizontale. Următoarele `n` linii vor conţine perechi de valori de pe axa `Oy` ce delimitează câte o pistă de biciclete orizontală.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul `parc.out` va conţine pe prima linie lungimea minimă a drumului cerut de problemă, un număr real. Linia a doua va conţine numărul drumurilor minime distincte, un număr natural. 

# Restricţii şi precizări
* `0 ≤ xG, xpr ≤ Xparc ≤ 30 000, 0 ≤ yG, ypr ≤ Yparc ≤ 30 000`;
* `0 < m, n < 2000`;
* perechile de numere naturale ce definesc o pistă nu sunt ordonate;
* pistele orizontale, şi cele verticale nu sunt ordonate în fişierul de intrare;
* două piste de aceeaşi direcţie nu se suprapun;
* Gigel şi prietenului lui sunt pe zone pietonale (incluzând şi marginile acestora);
* două drumuri sunt distincte dacă diferă prin cel puţin un punct;
* numărul de drumuri distincte nu va depăşi `1 000 000 000`;
* lungimea drumului din fişierul de ieşire este un număr real ce se va accepta cu eroare maxima de `0.01`;
* nu se admite formatul ştiinţific pentru afişarea numerelor reale; 
* prima cerinţă valorează `40%` din punctaj, iar a doua valorează `60%` din punctaj.
