Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `subsecvente.in` and write to `subsecvente.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Fie `n` un număr natural și $M=\{S_1,S_2,…,S_n\}$ o mulțime de șiruri de caractere nevide. Fie $S_k$ un șir de caractere din `M`. Atunci, orice caracter al lui $S_k$ aparține mulțimii `{ 'a', 'b' }`. Notăm prin $|S_k|$ numărul caracterelor șirului $S_k$ sau, echivalent, lungimea sa. O subsecvență $S_k[i:j]$ a lui $S_k$ este formată din caracterele situate pe pozițiile consecutive `i, i+1, ..., j`. Astfel, dacă $S_k = abbbaababa$, atunci $S_k[3:6] = bbaa$ sau subsecvența evidențiată: ab**bbaa**baba.

# Cerință
Fiind dată o mulțime `M`, se cere să se determine lungimea maximă a unei subsecvențe care se găsește în toate șirurile din `M`.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `subsecvente.in` se găsește un număr natural `n` egal cu cardinalul mulțimii `M`. Pe fiecare din următoarele `n` linii se găsește câte un șir din mulțimea `M`.

# Date de ieșire
Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `subsecvente.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural egal cu lungimea subsecvenței găsite.

# Restricții
* `1 < n < 5`
* Dacă $|S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + … + |S_n|$, atunci `|S| < 50 001`
* Se garantează că va exista întotdeauna soluție
* Se garantează că rezultatul nu va depăși `60`
* Pentru `30%` din teste: `|S| < 101`
* Pentru `55%` din teste: `|S| < 3 501`
* Pentru `80%` din teste: `|S| < 10 001`

`subsecvente.in`
```

abbabaaaaabb
aaaababab
bbbbaaaab
aaaaaaabaaab

`subsecvente.out`
```

Program exited with code 139.
stdout:
```

```
stderr:
```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  basic_string::substr: __pos (which is 13) > this->size() (which is 12)

```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.
Implement a solution to fix the program

The program exited with code 139 because it tried to access a character that was out of bounds in the string.
```c++
if (s[j].find(s[0].substr(i, 1)) == string::npos) {
```
This line tries to find the character at position `i` in the string `s[0]`, but if `i` is equal to the length of the string, it will throw an out of bounds error.
To fix this, we can add a check to make sure that `i` is less than the length of the string before trying to access the character:
```c++
if (i < s[0].length() && s[j].find(s[0].substr(i, 1)) == string::npos) {
```
Here is the full fixed code:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 5;
const int MAX_S = 50000;

int main() {
  ifstream fin("subsecvente.in");
  ofstream fout("subsecvente.out");

  int n;
  fin >> n;

  vector<string> s(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    fin >> s[i];
  }

  int ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_S; ++i) {
    bool ok = true;
    for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
      if (i < s[0].length() && s[j].find(s[0].substr(i, 1)) == string::npos) {
        ok = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (ok) ans++;

The reason why the found result is different from the expected result is that the program is not stopping when it finds a character that is not in all of the strings.
Instead, it continues to iterate through the characters in the string, and increments the answer for each character that is in all of the strings.
This is incorrect, because the answer should only be incremented once for each character that is in all of the strings.

To fix this, we can add a break statement after the line that checks if the character is not in all of the strings:
```c++
if (i < s[0].length() && s[j].find(s[0].substr(i, 1)) == string::npos) {
  ok = false;
  break;
