Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `magic.in` and write to `magic.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Rămaşi singuri în pădure, Hansel şi Grettel, ştiu că singura lor şansă de supravieţuire este să găsească şi să intre în Castelul de Turtă Dulce. Poarta castelului este închisă şi pentru a intra este nevoie de un cuvânt magic şi de un număr fermecat.

Zâna cea Bună îi vede pe copii şi pentru că vrea să–i ajute le spune:
„Mergeţi tot înainte, iar în drumul vostru o să întâlniţi copaci pe a căror trunchiuri sunt scrise caractere reprezentând litere sau cifre. Cuvântul magic este format din toate caracterele literă în ordinea în care apar, dar scrise toate cu majuscule. Numărul fermecat este cel mai mic număr cu cifre distincte care se poate forma din caracterele cifră.”

# Cerință

Pentru a-i ajuta pe Hansel şi Grettel să intre în Castelul de Turtă Dulce, scrieţi un program care citeşte un număr natural $n$, apoi $n$ caractere şi determină:

* cuvântul magic;
* numărul fermecat;

# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `magic.in` se găseste un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de caractere scrise pe copaci. Pe cea de a doua linie sunt $n$ caractere separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând caracterele scrise pe copaci.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `magic.out` va conține două linii:

* pe prima linie se va scrie un şir de litere mari, reprezentând cuvântul magic;
* pe a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural cu cifre distincte, reprezentând numărul fermecat.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Caracterele sunt doar cifre sau litere mici ale alfabetului englez.
* Printre cele $n$ caractere se află întotdeauna cel puțin o literă şi cel puţin o cifră.
* Pe fiecare copac este scris un singur caracter.
* Numărul magic începe întotdeauna cu o cifră diferită de zero.
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă 40% din punctaj, pentru cerinţa b) 60% din punctaj.

Example:
`magic.in`
```
6
c 2 5 5 b 2
```

`magic.out`
```
CB
25

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result has the characters in the word in the wrong order. The expected result is `CB`, but the found result is `BC`. This is because the code sorts the characters in the word in ascending order, but the expected result has the characters in descending order.

To fix this, we can simply change the line

```cpp
sort(word.begin(), word.end());
```

to

```cpp
sort(word.rbegin(), word.rend());
```

This will sort the characters in the word in descending order, which will produce the expected result.

Here is the fixed code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream fin("magic.in");
  ofstream fout("magic.out");

  int n;
  fin >> n;

  vector<char> v;
  string word;

  while (n--) {
    char c;
    fin >> c;
    if (isalpha(c)) word += toupper(c);
    else v.push_back(c);
  }

  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  sort(word.rbegin(), word.rend());

  fout << word << endl;

  string number;
  for (char c : v) {
    if (number.empty() && c == '0') continue;
    if (number.find(c) == string::npos) number += c;
  }

  if (number.empty()) number = "0";
  fout << number << endl;

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result has the characters in the word in the wrong order and the number is incorrect. The expected result is `CABD` and `205`, but the found result is `DCBA` and `25`.

The reason for the incorrect word is the same as in the previous case: the code sorts the characters in the word in ascending order, but the expected result has the characters in descending order.

The reason for the incorrect number is that the code does not correctly handle the case where the number starts with a 0. In the expected result, the number starts with a 2, but in the found result, the number starts with a 25.

To fix these issues, we can make the following changes to the code:

* Change the line

```cpp
sort(word.begin(), word.end());
```

to

```cpp
sort(word.rbegin(), word.rend());
```

* Add a check to the loop that builds the number to see if the number is empty and the current character is a 0. If so, we can skip the current character.

Here is the fixed code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream fin("magic.in");
  ofstream fout("magic.out");

  fin >> n;

  vector<char> v;
  string word;

  while (n--) {
    char c;
    fin >> c;
    if (isalpha(c)) word += toupper(c);
    else v.push_back(c);
  }

  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  sort(word.rbegin(), word.rend());

  fout << word << endl;

  string number;
  for (char c : v) {
    if (number.empty() && c == '0') continue;
    if (number.find(c) == string::npos) number += c;
  }

  if (number.empty()) number = "0";
