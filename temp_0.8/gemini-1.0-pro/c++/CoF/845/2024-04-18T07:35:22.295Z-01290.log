Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `munte.in` and write to `munte.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un șir $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ format din $n$ numere naturale distincte. O secvență de număr maxim de elemente vecine în șir, de forma $x_i, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_{k-1}, x_k, x_{k+1}, \dots, x_j$ ($1 \leq i < k < j \leq n$) cu proprietatea că $x_i < x_{i+1} < \dots < x_{k-1} < x_k > x_{k+1} > \dots > x_j$, se numește *munte* cu vârful $x_k$. Două secvențe munte au maxim un element comun în șir. O secvență munte are cel puțin $3$ elemente. Un exemplu de șir format cu valorile $3 \ 4 \ 6 \ 8$ nu conține nicio secvență munte, iar unul format cu valorile $3 \ 4 \ 8 \ 1 \ 2 \ 5 \ 0$ conține $2$ secvențe munte: $3 \ 4 \ 8 \ 1$ și $1 \ 2 \ 5 \ 0$.

După determinarea tuturor secvențelor munte și a vârfurilor acestora, se elimină din șir vârfurile secvențelor munte și procedura continuă repetat cu determinarea noilor secvențe munte și a vârfurilor lor din șirul nou obținut. Procedura se oprește în momentul în care în șir nu mai există nicio secvență munte.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește numerele $n, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ și apoi determină:

1. numărul de secvențe munte din șirul inițial;
2. numărul total de secvențe munte obținute pornind de la șirul inițial până la cel care nu mai conține nicio secvență munte;
3. numărul de elemente din șirul final care nu mai conține secvențe munte.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `munte.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $n$, iar pe următoarea linie numerele naturale $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `munte.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural conform cerinței $1$, pe a doua linie un număr natural conform cerinței $2$, pe a treia linie un număr natural conform cerinței $3$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $0 \leq x_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se obține $20$% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se obține $40$% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $3$ se obține $40$% din punctaj.
* Pentru testele date se asigură că șirul de numere dat inițial conține cel puțin o secvență munte.

---------- assistant ----------

The program exited with code 139 because it tried to access an element outside of the bounds of the array `a`.
This happened because in the loop `for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++)`, when `i` is greater than `n`, the program tries to access `v[i]`, which is out of bounds.
To fix this issue, the loop should be changed to `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`.

Here is the corrected code:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
ifstream in("munte.in");
ofstream out("munte.out");
int n, a[110], nr, nr_el, nr_mt;
vector<int> v[110];

bool cmp(int i, int j) { return a[i] < a[j]; }

int main() {
  in >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) in >> a[i];
  sort(a + 1, a + n + 1, cmp);
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
      nr++;
      v[a[i]].push_back(a[i + 1]);
      nr_el++;
    }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    if (v[i].size() > 0) {

The differences between the expected and found result are:

* The expected number of mountains is 2, but the found number is 1.
* The expected total number of mountains is 4, but the found number is 1.
* The expected number of elements in the final array is 4, but the found number is 5.

The reason for these differences is that the code does not correctly identify the mountains in the array.
The code only identifies mountains that have a peak that is greater than both of its neighbors.
However, the definition of a mountain also includes mountains that have a peak that is greater than or equal to one of its neighbors.

To fix this issue, the code should be changed to identify mountains that have a peak that is greater than or equal to both of its neighbors.
