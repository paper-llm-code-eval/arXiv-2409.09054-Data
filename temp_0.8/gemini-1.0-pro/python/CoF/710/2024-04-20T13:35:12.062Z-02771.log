Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cod.in` and write to `cod.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Principala misiune a unei expediții stiintifice este de a studia evoluția vieții pe o planetă nou descoperită. În urma studiilor efectuate, cercetătorii au asociat fiecărui organism viu descoperit pe acea planetă un cod caracteristic. Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

De asemenea, cercetătorii au observat că pentru orice organism viu de pe planetă, codurile caracteristice ale strămoșilor săi pe scara evoluției se pot obține prin ștergerea unor cifre din codul caracteristic al organismului respectiv, iar un organism este cu atât mai evoluat cu cât codul său caracteristic are o valoare mai mare.

# Cerință

Date fiind codurile caracteristice ale două organisme vii diferite, scrieți un program care să determine codul caracteristic al celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lor.


# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține:

* $n$ - codul caracteristic al primului organism
* $m$ - codul caracteristic al celui de-al doilea organism

# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` conține pe prima linie:

* $p$ – codul celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lui $n$ si $m$

# Restricții și precizări

* Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

Example:
`cod.in`
```
7145
847835
```

`cod.out`
```
75

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open("cod.in") as f:
    n, m = f.read().splitlines()

lcs = ""

for i in range(min(len(n), len(m))):
    if n[i] == m[i]:

    else:
        break

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
7145
847835
```
Expected output:
```
75
```
Found output:
```

```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The previous solution was incorrect because it did not take into account the fact that the most evolved common ancestor might not be a prefix of both input strings.

Here is a corrected solution:

```python
with open("cod.in") as f:
    n, m = f.read().splitlines()

lcs = ""
i = 0
j = 0

while i < len(n) and j < len(m):
    if n[i] == m[j]:
        lcs += n[i]
        i += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        if n[i] < m[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1

with open("cod.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(lcs)

The previous solution was incorrect because it did not handle the case where the two input strings have different lengths.

Here is a corrected solution:

```python
with open("cod.in") as f:
    n, m = f.read().splitlines()

if len(n) < len(m):
    n, m = m, n

lcs = ""
i = 0
j = 0

while i < len(n) and j < len(m):
    if n[i] == m[j]:
        lcs += n[i]
        i += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1

The previous solution was incorrect because it did not handle the case where the two input strings have different lengths correctly.
