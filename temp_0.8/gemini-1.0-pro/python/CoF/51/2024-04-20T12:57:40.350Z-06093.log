Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `lant.in` and write to `lant.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Ion este un lingvist pasionat. Recent el a descoperit un text scris într-o limbă necunoscută. Textul este scris pe mai multe linii şi este format din cuvinte scrise cu litere mici din alfabetul latin, separate prin spaţii sau/şi semne de punctuaţie (`,:;.!?-`).

Ion a fost frapat că există multe similitudini între cuvintele din text. Fiind foarte riguros, Ion defineşte similitudinea a două cuvinte după cum urmează.

Fie $c_1$ şi $c_2$ două cuvinte. Cuvântul $c_1$ poate fi obţinut din cuvântul $c_2$ printr-o succesiune de operaţii elementare. Operaţiile elementare ce pot fi folosite sunt:
* ștergerea unui caracter
* inserarea unui caracter
* modificarea unui caracter

Definim similitudinea dintre $c_1$ şi $c_2$ ca fiind numărul minim de operaţii aplicate cuvântului $c_1$ pentru a ajunge la cuvântul $c_2$.

Fie $c_0$ primul cuvânt din text. Începând cu $c_0$ putem construi lanţuri de $k$-similitudine. 

Un lanţ de $k$-similitudine este o succesiune de cuvinte distincte din text cu următoarele proprietăţi:
- dacă cuvântul $x$ apare în lanţ înaintea cuvântului $y$, atunci prima apariţie a lui $x$ în text precedă prima apariţie a lui $y$ în text;
- dacă $x$ şi $y$ sunt cuvinte consecutive în lanţ (în ordinea $x\ y$) , atunci similitudinea dintre $x$ şi $y$ este $≤k$;
- lanţul este maximal (adică nu putem adăuga încă un cuvânt la sfârşitul acestui lanţ, astfel încât să fie respectate proprietăţile precedente).

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să determine numărul de lanţuri de $k$-similitudine care încep cu $c_0$.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `lant.in` conţine pe prima linie valoarea $k$. Pe următoarele linii se află textul dat.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `lant.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scris numărul de lanţuri de $k$-similitudine care încep cu $c_0$.

# Restricţii
* Lungimea unei linii din text nu depăşeşte $1\ 000$ de caractere.
* Lungimea unui cuvânt nu depăşeşte $30$ de caractere.
* Numărul total de cuvinte $≤ 150$.
* Pentru datele de test, numărul de lanţuri de $k$-similitudine care încep cu $c_0$ va fi $≤ 2\ 000\ 000\ 000$.
* Enunțul a fost modificat

Example:
`lant.in`
```
5
ana are mere, banane,
pere si castane.
```

`lant.out`
```

The issue with the previous solution was that it didn't take into account that the words in the text could repeat. This could lead to incorrect results, as the `cnt` variable would be incremented multiple times for the same word.

To fix this issue, the solution can be modified to use a `set` to keep track of the words that have already been visited. This way, each word will only be counted once, and the `cnt` variable will accurately reflect the number of distinct words in the chain.

Here is the modified solution:
```python
with open("lant.in") as f:
    k = int(f.readline())
    text = f.read().split()

dist = {}

for word in text:
    dist[word] = []

for i, word1 in enumerate(text):
    for j in range(i+1, len(text)):
        word2 = text[j]
        if word1 == word2:
            continue
        ops = 0
        if len(word1) == len(word2):
            for c1, c2 in zip(word1, word2):
                if c1 != c2:
                    ops += 1
        else:
            ops = max(len(word1), len(word2))
        if ops <= k:
            dist[word1].append(word2)
            dist[word2].append(word1)

first_word = text[0]
vis = set()
cnt = 0

def dfs(node):
    global cnt
    cnt += 1
    vis.add(node)
    for neighbor in dist[node]:
        if neighbor not in vis:
            dfs(neighbor)

dfs(first_word)
