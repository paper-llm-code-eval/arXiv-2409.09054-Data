Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `furnica.in` and write to `furnica.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Pe o tablă de șah cu $n$ linii și $n$ coloane se află firimituri de pâine și o furnică. Pentru fiecare pătrățel, inclusiv cel în care se găsește furnica, aflat pe linia $i$ și coloana $j$, cantitatea de firimituri de pâine este egală cu restul împărțirii lui $i + j$ la $6$. Astfel pentru $n = 4$ tabla de șah conține următoarele cantități de firimituri:

|2|3|4|5|
-|-|-|-
|**3**|**4**|**5**|**0**|
|**4**|**5**|**0**|**1**|
|**5**|**0**|**1**|**2**|

Furnica (notată cu `F` în figura de mai jos) se poate deplasa din pătrățelul unde se găsește în toate cele opt pătrățele vecine, numerotate ca mai jos:

|8|1|2|
-|-|-
|**7**|**F**|**3**|
|**6**|**5**|**4**|

Furnica se deplasează, pornind din pătrățica aflată în colțul din stânga sus, în una dintre pătrățelele vecine, și așa mai departe. Pe drumul său furnica se hrănește cu toată cantitatea de firimituri din pătrățelele prin care a trecut (după ce iese din pătrățică catitatea de firimituri devine $0$). Drumul furnicii este dat printr-un șir de $k$ numere naturale (cuprinse între $1$ și $8$) care precizează, la fiecare pas, următorul pătrățel din drum.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru un drum dat determină cantitatea totală de firimituri mâncată de furnică, precum și numărul pătrățelelor prin care aceasta a trecut de cele mai multe ori.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `furnica.in` conține pe prima linie numerele $n$ și $k$, separate între ele printr-un spațiu, iar pe linia următoare $k$ numere naturale ($1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$ sau $8$) separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând următorul pătrățel din drum pentru un pătrățel curent.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `furnica.out` va conține, pe prima linie, cantitatea totală și numărul pătrățelelor din cerință separate printr-un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 101$;
* $0 < k < 201$;
* Drumul furnicii nu iese din tablou.

`furnica.in`

Program exited with code 1.

```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The program exited with code 1 most likely because of an index out of range error. This could be caused by the `x` or `y` variables going out of bounds.
To fix this issue, we can add boundary checks to make sure that `x` and `y` are always within the range of the `board`.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('furnica.in', 'r') as fin, open('furnica.out', 'w') as fout:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    path = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

    board = [[(i + j) % 6 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    freq = [0] * 9

    x, y = 0, 0
    freq[1] = 1
    total = board[x][y]

    for step in path:
        x += (step == 1 or step == 2 or step == 3) - (step == 7 or step == 8 or step == 9)
        y += (step == 3 or step == 4 or step == 5) - (step == 1 or step == 2 or step == 9)

        # Check if x and y are within the range of the board
        if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n:
            freq[step] += 1
            total += board[x][y]
        else:
            # If x or y is out of bounds, ignore the step
            continue

    fout.write(f'{total} {freq.index(max(freq))}')

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result is missing 1 unit of food. This is because the code does not correctly handle the case when the ant moves out of the bounds of the board.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to make sure that the ant is always within the bounds of the board. If the ant moves out of bounds, we can simply ignore the move.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('furnica.in', 'r') as fin, open('furnica.out', 'w') as fout:

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result has 4 extra units of food and the most visited cell is incorrect. This is because the code does not correctly handle the case when the ant moves out of the bounds of the board.
