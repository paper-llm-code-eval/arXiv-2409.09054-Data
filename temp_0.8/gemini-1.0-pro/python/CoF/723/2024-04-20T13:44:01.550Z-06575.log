Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `expresie.in` and write to `expresie.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un șir de $n$ numere naturale nenule $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ și un număr natural $m$.

# Cerință
Să se verifice dacă valoarea expresiei $\sqrt[m]{x_1 x_2 x_3 \dots x_n}$ este un număr natural. În caz afirmativ să se afișeze acest număr descompus în factori primi.

# Date de intrare
În fișierul `expresie.in` se află pe prima linie $m$, pe linia a doua $n$, iar pe linia a treia numerele $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_n$ separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul `expresie.out` se va scrie pe prima linie cifra $0$, dacă valoarea expresiei nu este un număr natural, respectiv $1$ dacă este un număr natural. 
Dacă valoarea expresiei este un număr natural, pe următoarele linii se vor scrie perechi de forma "$p\ e$" ($p$ este factor prim care apare în descompunere la puterea $e \geq 1$). Aceste perechi se vor scrie în ordine crescătoare după primul număr (adică $p$).

# Restricții
- $n$ este un număr natural nenul mai mic strict decât $5\ 000$.
- $x_i$ este un număr natural nenul mai mic strict decât $30\ 000$, $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.
- **$m$ poate fi una din cifrele $2$, $3$ sau $4$.**

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly handles the case when `m` is 2 and `n` is odd, as it incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `0`.

The issue with the previous solution was that it incorrectly handled the case where `m` is 2 and `n` is odd, as it incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `0`.
The issue was caused by the incorrect placement of the parentheses in the following line:
