Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `telecabina.in` and write to `telecabina.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În Munții Apuseni, din cauza condițiilor meteo nefavorabile din ultimul timp, transportul pe drumurile publice a devenit o problemă. S-au surpat porțiuni din drum, s-au rupt poduri și podețe, au căzut pomi peste șosea si multe altele. Au rămas astfel grupuri de case izolate, oamenii nemaiputând ajunge la oraș pentru a-și procura cele necesare. Pentru a ajunge la oraș, oamenii au construit o telecabină care leagă regiunile izolate, telecabină care a fost proiectată suficient de încăpătoare, astfel încât, în fiecare moment să fie posibil să urce toți oamenii care se află într-o stație.
Pentru fiecare dintre cele n stații ale telecabinei se cunoaște altitudinea (exprimată în metri) și numărul de persoane care urcă în telecabină. De asemenea, se știe că telecabina consumă $3$ litri/m de combustibil la urcare și $1$ litru/m de combustibil la coborâre. Distanțele între stații se echivalează practic cu diferențele de altitudini dintre stații. O stație în care se schimbă felul de deplasare, din urcare se trece în coborâre sau invers se numește stație specială.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine câți oameni ajung la oraș cu telecabina, care este consumul telecabinei pentru transport și câte stații speciale există.

# Date de intrare


De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `telecabina.in` se citește valoarea $n$, reprezentând numărul de stații (inclusiv orașul). De pe următoarele n linii ale fișierului de intrare se citesc apoi $n$ perechi de numere naturale `a b`, câte o pereche pe linie, unde $a$ reprezintă altitudinea stației, iar $b$ numărul de oameni care urcă în telecabină în stația respectivă. Între $a$ și $b$ există exact un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


Pe primul rând al fișierului de ieșire `telecabina.out` se va afișa numărul de oameni care ajung la oraș. Pe al doilea rând al fișierului se va afișa consumul telecabinei pentru transport. Pe al treilea rând al fișierului se va afișa numărul de stații speciale.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 40$;
* $1 \leq a \leq 2 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq b \leq 20$;
* altitudinile oricăror două stații consecutive sunt diferite
* în ultima stație (la oraș) nu urcă nici o persoană

altitudes, people = zip(*stations)

# Initialize the state with the first station
state = (0, people[0], 0)  # (altitude, people_onboard, stations_changed)

# Iterate over the remaining stations
for altitude, people_entering in stations[1:]:

    # Calculate the fuel consumption and number of stations changed
    fuel_consumption = (altitude - state[0]) * 3 if altitude > state[0] else (state[0] - altitude)
    stations_changed = 1 if (altitude > state[0] and state[0] > 0) or (altitude < state[0] and state[0] < 0) else 0

    # Update the state

The provided solution had a bug in the calculation of the fuel consumption. It was incorrectly using the absolute difference in altitude between the current and previous stations, which resulted in an overestimation of the fuel consumption.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
with open('telecabina.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    stations = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in f]

altitudes, people = zip(*stations)
people = [0] + list(people)  # add a dummy station at the beginning

# Initialize the state with the first station
state = (0, people[0], 0)  # (altitude, people_onboard, stations_changed)

# Iterate over the remaining stations
for altitude, people_entering in stations[1:]:

    # Calculate the fuel consumption and number of stations changed
    fuel_consumption = (altitude - state[0]) * 3 if altitude > state[0] else (altitude - state[0])
    stations_changed = 1 if (altitude > state[0] and state[0] > 0) or (altitude < state[0] and state[0] < 0) else 0

    # Update the state
    state = (altitude, state[1] + people_entering, state[2] + stations_changed)

# Write the output to the file
with open('telecabina.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(state[1]) + '\n')
    f.write(str(fuel_consumption) + '\n')
    f.write(str(state[2]) + '\n')
