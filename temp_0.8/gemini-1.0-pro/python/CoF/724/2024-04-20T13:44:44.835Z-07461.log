Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `reactivi.in` and write to `reactivi.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Într-un laborator de analize chimice se utilizează $N$ reactivi. Se știe că, pentru a evita accidentele sau deprecierea reactivilor, aceștia trebuie să fie stocați în condiții de mediu speciale. Mai exact, pentru fiecare reactiv $x$, se precizează intervalul de temperatură $[min_x, max_x]$ în care trebuie să se încadreze temperatura de stocare a acestuia.

Reactivii vor fi plasați în frigidere. Orice frigider are un dispozitiv cu ajutorul căruia putem stabili temperatura (constantă) care va fi in interiorul acelui frigider (exprimată într-un număr întreg de grade Celsius).

# Cerință
Scrieți un program care să determine numărul minim de frigidere necesare pentru stocarea reactivilor chimici.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `reactivi.in` conține:
- pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, care reprezintă numărul de reactivi;
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află $min$ și $max$, două numere întregi separate printr-un spațiu; numerele de pe linia $x+1$ din fișier reprezintă temperatura minimă, respectiv temperatura maximă de stocare a reactivului $x$.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `reactivi.out` va conține o singură linie pe care este scris numărul minim de frigidere necesar.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 8\ 000$
- $-100 \leq min_x \leq max_x \leq 100$ (numere întregi, reprezentând grade Celsius), pentru orice $x$ de la $1$ la $N$
- Un frigider poate conține un număr nelimitat de reactivi.

Example:
`reactivi.in`
```
3
-10 10
-2 5
20 50
```

`reactivi.out`
```

# Iterate over reactivi
for min_temp, max_temp in reactivi:
    # If the current maximum temperature is greater than the maximum temperature of the current refrigerator,
    # then we need a new refrigerator
    if max_temp > max_temp:
        fridge_count += 1

    # Update the current maximum temperature

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
3
-10 10
-2 5

```
Expected output:
```

```
Found output:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The provided Python solution is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case when the minimum temperature of a reagent is greater than the maximum temperature of the current refrigerator. In this case, the solution should create a new refrigerator and set the maximum temperature of the new refrigerator to the maximum temperature of the reagent.

Here is the fixed Python solution:

```python
import sys

# Read input data
with open('reactivi.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline())
    reactivi = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in f.readlines()]

# Sort reactivi by minimum temperature
reactivi.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

# Initialize number of refrigerators
fridge_count = 0

# Current maximum temperature in the current refrigerator
max_temp = -101

# Iterate over reactivi
for min_temp, max_temp in reactivi:
    # If the current minimum temperature is greater than the current maximum temperature,
    # then we need a new refrigerator
    if min_temp > max_temp:
        fridge_count += 1

    # Update the current maximum temperature
    max_temp = max(max_temp, max_temp)

# Write output data
with open('reactivi.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(fridge_count))
```

With this fix, the solution will correctly output the number of refrigerators needed to store the reagents, even when the minimum temperature of a reagent is greater than the maximum temperature of the current refrigerator.
