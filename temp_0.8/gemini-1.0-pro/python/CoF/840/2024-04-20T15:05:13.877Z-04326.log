Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cool.in` and write to `cool.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un șir $A$ format din $N$ elemente naturale nenule. Numim secvență de lungime $K$ a șirului $A$ orice succesiune de elemente consecutive din șir de forma $A_i, A_{i+1}, \dots, A_{i+K-1}$.

O secvență o numim *secvență cool* dacă elementele care o compun sunt distincte și pot fi rearanjate astfel încât să alcătuiască o secvență continuă de numere consecutive.

De exemplu, considerând șirul $A = (3,1,6,8,4,5,6,7,4,3,4)$, atunci secvența $(8,4,5,6,7)$ este o *secvență cool* deoarece conține elemente distincte ce pot fi rearanjate astfel încât să alcătuiască șirul de numere consecutive $4,5,6,7,8$, pe când secvențele $(4,3,4)$, $(6,7,4,3)$ **nu** sunt considerate *secvențe cool*.

# Cerinţă
Fiind dat un şir de $N$ numere naturale nenule se cer următoarele:
1. Pentru o valoare dată $K$ să se verifice dacă secvența $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_K$ este *secvență cool*. Dacă secvența este *cool*, atunci se va afișa cea mai mare valoare ce aparține secvenței. Dacă secvența nu este *cool*, atunci se va afișa numărul elementelor distincte din secvența $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_K$, adică numărul elementelor care apar o singură dată.
2. Lungimea maximă a unei *secvențe cool* și numărul *secvențelor cool* de lungime maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `cool.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $p$. Pentru toate testele de intrare, numărul $p$ poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau valoarea $2$. Pe linia a doua se găsesc, despărțite printr-un spațiu, două numere naturale $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarea linie se găsesc $N$ numere întregi, separate prin câte un spațiu, ce reprezintă elementele şirului.

# Date de ieşire
Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $1$, atunci **se va rezolva numai punctul 1** din cerință. În acest caz, fişierul de ieşire `cool.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural, număr ce reprezintă conform cerinței $1$, maximul secvenței $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_K$, dacă secvența este *secvență cool*, sau numărul elementelor distincte din secvență, dacă aceasta **nu** este *secvență cool*.
\
Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $2$, **se va rezolva numai punctul 2** din cerință. În acest caz, fişierul de ieşire `cool.out` va avea două linii. Prima linie va conține un număr natural nenul ce reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *secvențe cool*, iar următoarea linie un număr natural nenul ce reprezintă numărul de *secvențe cool* care au lungimea maximă.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 5\ 000$
- $2 \leq K \leq 1\ 000$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 1\ 000$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Pentru $30\%$ dintre teste $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerința a doua se acordă $80\%$ din punctaj.

`cool.in`
