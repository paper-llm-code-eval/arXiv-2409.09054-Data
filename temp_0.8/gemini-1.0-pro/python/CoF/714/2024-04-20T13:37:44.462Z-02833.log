Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `pinochio.in` and write to `pinochio.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În fiecare zi lucrătoare din săptămână, Pinochio spune câte o minciună datorită căreia nasul acestuia crește cu câte $p$ centimetri pe zi. Sâmbăta și duminica, când vine bunicul Gepeto acasă, pentru a nu-l supăra prea tare, Pinochio reușește să nu spună nici o minciună, ba chiar uitându-se în oglindă observă că în fiecare din aceste zile lungimea nasului său scade cu câte $1$ centimetru pe zi. Când începe o nouă săptămână, rămânând singur acasă Pinochio continuă șirul minciunilor.

# Cerință

Care este dimensiunea nasului lui Pinochio după $k$ zile știind că inițial nasul său măsura $n$ centimetri.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `pinochio.in` se citesc valorile $n$, $p$, $k$, care se găsesc pe prima linie a fișierului și sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


În fișierul de ieșire `pinochio.out` se va afișa pe prima linie un singur număr natural, numărul de centimetri cerut de problemă.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq k \leq 256$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100$;

Example:
`pinochio.in`
```
2 1 8
```

`pinochio.out`
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open("pinochio.in", "r") as f:
    n, p, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

with open("pinochio.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(n + 5 * p * (k // 7) - 2 * (k % 7)))

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
2 1 8
```
Expected output:
```
6
```
Found output:
```
5
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The bug in the previous solution was that it didn't account for the remaining days in the last week, which could be less than 7.
Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open("pinochio.in", "r") as f:
    n, p, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

with open("pinochio.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(n + 5 * p * (k // 7) - 2 * (k % 7) + p * (k % 7 > 2)))
