Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `tort.in` and write to `tort.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Un tort dreptunghiular de dimensiuni $M \cdot N$ trebuie împărţit în porţii pătrate de aceeaşi mărime.

# Cerință

Găsiţi numărul minim de porţii care se pot obţine şi dimensiunea $L$ a acestora. Atât dimensiunile dreptunghiului cât şi ale pătratelor în care se împarte sunt numere întregi.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `tort.in` va conţine pe prima linie numerele $M$ şi $N$ separate printr-un spaţiu. 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `tort.out` va conţine pe o singură linie, două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu, primul fiind numărul minim de porţii, iar celălalt dimensiunea $L$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq M, N \leq 10 \ 000$;

Example:
`tort.in`
```
20 24
```

`tort.out`
```
30 4

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open("tort.in", "r") as f_in:
    M, N = map(int, f_in.readline().split())

with open("tort.out", "w") as f_out:
    L = 1
    while (M % L == 0) and (N % L == 0):
        L += 1

    f_out.write(f"{M * N // L**2} {L}")

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
20 24
```
Expected output:
```
30 4
```
Found output:
```
53 3
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

Rewrite the solution.

The error was that the program should have checked the divisibility of both `M` and `N` to `L` at the same time, not one or the other.  

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open("tort.in", "r") as f_in:
    M, N = map(int, f_in.readline().split())

with open("tort.out", "w") as f_out:
    L = 1
    while M % L == 0 and N % L == 0:
        L += 1
    L -= 1

    f_out.write(f"{M * N // L**2} {L}")
```

The error was that the program should have decremented `L` by 1 after the `while` loop terminates, because the loop continues until `L` is no longer a divisor of both `M` and `N`.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open("tort.in", "r") as f_in:
    M, N = map(int, f_in.readline().split())

with open("tort.out", "w") as f_out:
    L = 1
    while M % L == 0 and N % L == 0:
        L += 1
    L -= 1

    f_out.write(f"{M * N // L**2} {L}")

The error was that the program should have used integer division when calculating the number of portions, because the result should be an integer.
