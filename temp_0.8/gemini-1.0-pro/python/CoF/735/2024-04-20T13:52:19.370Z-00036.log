Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `numere.in` and write to `numere.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Mircea este pasionat de programare. El a început să rezolve probleme din ce în ce mai grele. Astfel a ajuns la o problemă, care are ca date de intrare un tablou pătratic cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane, componente tabloului fiind toate numerele naturale distincte de la $1$ la $n^2$. Pentru a verifica programul pe care l-a scris îi trebuie un fişier care să conţină tabloul respectiv. După ce a creat acest fişier, fratele său, pus pe şotii îi umblă în fişier şi îi schimbă câteva numere consecutive, cu numărul $0$. Când se întoarce Mircea de la joacă constată cu stupoare că nu îi merge programul pentru testul respectiv. După câteva ore de depanare îşi dă seama că programul lui este corect şi că fişierul de intrare are probleme.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să-l ajute pe Mircea, găsindu-i cel mai mic şi cel mai mare dintre numerele consecutive schimbate de fratele său.

# Date de intrare
În fişierul `numere.in` se dă pe prima linie $n$, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii elementele tabloului, câte $n$ elemente pe o linie, separate între ele prin câte un spaţiu, după modificările făcute de fratele lui Mircea.

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `numere.out` se va scrie pe un singur rând cu un singur spaţiu între ele numerele cerute (primul fiind cel mai mic).

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $0 < n \leq 500$
- Fratele lui Mircea schimbă cel puţin un număr în fişier.
- Numerele schimbate de fratele lui Mircea sunt mai mici sau cel mult egale cu $60\ 000$.

Example:
`numere.in`
```
3
5 0 7
0 0 1
6 9 8
```

`numere.out`
```
2 4

The program exited with code 1 because of an IndexError.
The error was caused by trying to access an element in the `grid` list that is out of range.
The issue was in the following part of the code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if grid[i][j] == 0:
            if i > 0 and grid[i - 1][j] != 0:
                min_ = min(min_, grid[i - 1][j] + 1)
                max_ = max(max_, grid[i - 1][j])
            if j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] != 0:
                min_ = min(min_, grid[i][j - 1] + 1)
                max_ = max(max_, grid[i][j - 1])
```
The issue is that when `i` or `j` is 0, the code tries to access `grid[i - 1][j]` or `grid[i][j - 1]`, which is out of range.
To fix this, I need to add a check to make sure that `i` and `j` are not 0 before accessing the elements in the grid.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
n = int(open('numere.in').readline())
grid = []
for i in range(n):
    row = [int(x) for x in open('numere.in').readline().split()]
    grid.append(row)

min_ = 10 ** 9
max_ = -1
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if grid[i][j] == 0:
            if i > 0 and grid[i - 1][j] != 0:
                min_ = min(min_, grid[i - 1][j] + 1)
                max_ = max(max_, grid[i - 1][j])
            if j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] != 0:
                min_ = min(min_, grid[i][j - 1] + 1)
                max_ = max(max_, grid[i][j - 1])
