Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `lacusta.in` and write to `lacusta.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

Example:
`lacusta.in`
```
4 5
3 4 5 7 9
6 6 3 4 4
6 3 3 9 6
6 5 3 8 2
```

`lacusta.out`
```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The `NameError` is caused by the fact that the program is trying to use the variable `line` which is not defined. This is because the program is not reading the lines from the file. To fix this, I need to read the lines from the file using the `readline()` method of the file object.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open("lacusta.in") as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(n):
            grid[i][j] += min(grid[i - 1][j], grid[i][j - 1])

    for i in range(m - 1):
        for j in range(n):
            grid[m - 1 - i][j] += min(grid[m - i][j], grid[m - 1 - i][j - 1])

    with open("lacusta.out", "w") as f:
        f.write(str(grid[0][n - 1]))

The `IndexError` is caused by the fact that the program is trying to access an element of the `grid` list that is out of range. This is because the program is not checking if the value of `m - 1 - i` is less than 0. To fix this, I need to add a check to make sure that the value of `m - 1 - i` is greater than or equal to 0.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open("lacusta.in") as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(n):

            if m - 1 - i >= 0:
                grid[m - 1 - i][j] += min(grid[m - i][j], grid[m - 1 - i][j - 1])
