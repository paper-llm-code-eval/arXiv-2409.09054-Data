Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `lacusta.in` and write to `lacusta.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

`lacusta.in`
```
4 5
3 4 5 7 9
6 6 3 4 4
6 3 3 9 6
6 5 3 8 2

The issue with the previous solution was that it was not correctly updating the `dp` array. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
with open("lacusta.in") as fin, open("lacusta.out", "w") as fout:
    m, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin]
    dp = [[[0] * 3 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(3):
                if k == 0:
                    dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j][0], dp[i + 1][j][1])
                elif k == 1:
                    dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j][1], dp[i + 1][j][2])
                else:
                    dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j][2], dp[i + 1][j][0])
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i][j - 1][k])
                if j < n - 1:
                    dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i][j + 1][k])
            if i == 0 and k == 2:
                dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j]
            if i == 0:
                dp[i][j][1] = dp[i][j][0]
                dp[i][j][2] = dp[i][j][1]
    fout.write(str(dp[0][n - 1][2]))
```

The key difference between the incorrect and correct solutions is in the way the `dp` array is updated. In the incorrect solution, the `dp` array was updated as follows:

```python
dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j][0], dp[i + 1][j][1], dp[i + 1][j][2])
```

This is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the grasshopper can only move to the right or down. The correct way to update the `dp` array is as follows:

```python
if k == 0:
    dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j][0], dp[i + 1][j][1])
elif k == 1:
    dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j][1], dp[i + 1][j][2])
else:
    dp[i][j][k] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j][2], dp[i + 1][j][0])
```

This ensures that the grasshopper can only move to the right or down, and it chooses the minimum cost path to take.
