Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `gardul.in` and write to `gardul.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Doi copii vopsesc un gard alcătuit din $n$ scânduri pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $n$ astfel: primul ia o cutie de vopsea roșie cu care vopsește scândurile cu numărul $p$, $2 \cdot p$, $3 \cdot p$, etc. Al doilea procedează la fel, începe de la același capăt al gardului, dar ia o cutie de vopsea albastră și vopsește din $q$ în $q$ scânduri. Astfel, când vor termina de vopsit, gardul va avea multe scânduri nevopsite, unele scânduri vopsite în roșu, altele în albastru, iar altele în violet (cele care au fost vopsite și cu roșu și cu albastru).

# Cerință

Cunoscând numerele $n, p$ și $q$ afișați:

1. câte scânduri rămân nevopsite
2. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în roșu
3. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în albastru
4. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în violet

# Date de intrare

De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `gardul.in` se citește valoarea $n$, reprezentând numărul de scânduri din gard. De pe cea de a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se citesc valorile $p$ și $q$ separate de un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `gardul.out` se vor afișa, în ordine, cele patru numere naturale cerute, câte unul pe un rând, ca în exemplu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq p, q \leq 40 \ 000$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
n = int(open('gardul.in').readline())
p, q = map(int, open('gardul.in').readline().split())

nv = n
r = 0
b = 0
v = 0

for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i % p == 0 and i % q == 0:
        v += 1
        nv -= 1
    elif i % p == 0:
        r += 1
        nv -= 1
    elif i % q == 0:
        b += 1
        nv -= 1

open('gardul.out', 'w').write(str(nv) + "\n" + str(r) + "\n" + str(b) + "\n" + str(v))

The error message
```
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```
indicates that the line
```
p, q = map(int, open('gardul.in').readline().split())
```
is trying to unpack 2 values from a list that contains only 1 value. This happens because the input file `gardul.in` contains only one line with two numbers separated by a space, and the `readline()` method reads the entire line as a string. To fix this, we can use the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, and then split the string on the space character:
```
line = open('gardul.in').readline().strip()
p, q = map(int, line.split())
```
Here is the complete fixed solution:
```python
n = int(open('gardul.in').readline())
line = open('gardul.in').readline().strip()
p, q = map(int, line.split())

nv = n
r = 0
b = 0
v = 0
