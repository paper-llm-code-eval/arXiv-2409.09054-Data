Cei care au văzut filmul Nemuritorul, ştiu că fraza cu care nemuritorii încep lupta este "Nu poate să rămână decât unul singur". Să încercăm să simulăm povestea nemuritorilor. 

Într-o zonă dreptunghiulară formată din $n$ linii (numerotate de la $1$ la $n$) şi $m$ coloane (numerotate de la $1$ la $m$) se află maxim $n \times m-1 $nemuritori. Doi nemuritori vecini se "luptă" între ei şi cel care pierde lupta este eliminat. "Lupta" constă în săritura unuia dintre nemuritori peste celălalt, dacă această săritură se poate face. Săritura se poate face pe orizontală sau verticală şi nemuritorul peste care s-a sărit dispare. Prin vecin al nemuritorului din poziţia $(i, j)$ înţelegem un nemuritor din una dintre poziţiile $(i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1)$. Deci, după luptă nemuritorul din câmpul $(i,j)$ se va găsi în una dintre poziţiile: $(i-2,j), (i+2,j), (i,j-2)$ sau $(i,j+2)$, dacă această poziţie este liberă şi este în interiorul zonei.

# Cerinţă
Se cere să se determine o succesiune a luptelor ce pot fi purtate, astfel încât la final să rămână un singur nemuritor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `immortal.in` conţine pe prima linie trei valori naturale $n m I$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de linii, numărul de coloane ale zonei descrise şi respectiv numărul de nemuritori existenţi iniţial. Următoarele $I$ linii conţin fiecare câte două numere naturale $x\ y$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând poziţiile unde se găsesc iniţial cei $I$ nemuritori (linia şi coloana).  

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de intrare `immortal.out` va conţine $I-1$ linii, fiecare linie descriind o "luptă". Luptele vor fi scrise în ordinea în care au avut loc. O linie va conţine $4$ numere naturale care indică: primele două poziţia de pe care pleacă un nemuritor la "luptă", ultimele două poziţia pe care acesta ajunge după "luptă". Pentru ca "lupta" să fie corectă, în poziţia peste care nemuritorul "sare" trebuie să existe un nemuritor care va "muri". O poziţie va fi specificată prin indicele de linie urmat de indicele de coloană. Valorile scrise pe aceeaşi linie vor fi separate prin spaţii.

# Restricţii
* $1 < n, m ≤ 20$
* $1 < I ≤ min{15, n \times m-1}$
* Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie.

The error message indicates that the program is trying to access an index that is out of range. This is happening in the line:

```python
if board[x + 2][y] == 0:
```

This line is trying to access the element at index `x + 2` in the list `board[y]`. However, the list `board[y]` only has `m` elements, and the index `x + 2` is out of range.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the index `x + 2` is within the range of the list `board[y]`. We can do this by adding a check to make sure that `x + 2` is less than or equal to `m`. If it is not, then we can skip the rest of the code in the `if` statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

                        board[x + 2][y] = 1
                        board[x][y] = 0

The exit code 137 is caused by a segmentation fault. This is usually caused by accessing memory that is out of bounds.

In this case, the most likely cause is that the program is trying to access an element of the `board` list that is out of bounds. This could happen if the program tries to access an element that is less than 1 or greater than `n + 2`.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that all of the indices that we use to access the `board` list are within the range of the list. We can do this by adding checks to make sure that the indices are within the range of the list before we try to access them.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

fin = open("immortal.in", "r")
fout = open("immortal.out", "w")

def solve():
    n, m, i = map(int, fin.readline().split())

        board[x][y] = 1

                        board[x][y] = 0
                        fout.write(f"{x} {y} {x + 2} {y}\n")

The error message indicates that the program is trying to access an index that is out of range. This is happening in the line:

```python
if x + 2 <= m + 2 and board[x + 2][y] == 0:
```

This line is trying to access the element at index `x + 2` in the list `board[y]`. However, the list `board[y]` only has `m` elements, and the index `x + 2` is out of range.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the index `x + 2` is within the range of the list `board[y]`. We can do this by adding a check to make sure that `x + 2` is less than or equal to `m`. If it is not, then we can skip the rest of the code in the `if` statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

fin = open("immortal.in", "r")
fout = open("immortal.out", "w")

def solve():
    n, m, i = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    board = [[0] * (m + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]
    for _ in range(i):
        x, y = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        board[x][y] = 1
    
    while True:
        found = False
        for x in range(1, n + 1):
            for y in range(1, m + 1):
                if board[x][y]:
                    if x + 2 <= m and board[x + 2][y] == 0:
                        board[x + 2][y] = 1
                        board[x][y] = 0
                        fout.write(f"{x} {y} {x + 2} {y}\n")
                        found = True
                        break
                    elif x - 2 >= 1 and board[x - 2][y] == 0:
                        board[x - 2][y] = 1
                        board[x][y] = 0
                        fout.write(f"{x} {y} {x - 2} {y}\n")
                        found = True
                        break
                    elif y + 2 <= m and board[x][y + 2] == 0:

The exit code 137 is caused by a segmentation fault. This is usually caused by accessing memory that is out of bounds.

In this case, the most likely cause is that the program is trying to access an element of the `board` list that is out of bounds. This could happen if the program tries to access an element that is less than 1 or greater than `n + 2`.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that all of the indices that we use to access the `board` list are within the range of the list. We can do this by adding checks to make sure that the indices are within the range of the list before we try to access them.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

fin = open("immortal.in", "r")
fout = open("immortal.out", "w")

def solve():
    n, m, i = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    board = [[0] * (m + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]
    for _ in range(i):
        x, y = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        board[x][y] = 1
    
    while True:
        found = False
        for x in range(1, n + 1):
            for y in range(1, m + 1):
                if board[x][y]:
                    if x + 2 <= m + 2 and board[x + 2][y] == 0:
                        board[x + 2][y] = 1
                        board[x][y] = 0
                        fout.write(f"{x} {y} {x + 2} {y}\n")
                        found = True
                        break
                    elif x - 2 >= 1 and board[x - 2][y] == 0:
                        board[x - 2][y] = 1
                        board[x][y] = 0
                        fout.write(f"{x} {y} {x - 2} {y}\n")
                        found = True
