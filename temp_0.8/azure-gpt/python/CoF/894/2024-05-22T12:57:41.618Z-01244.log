Se consideră răsturnatul unui număr natural valoarea obținută prin parcurgerea cifrelor acestuia de la dreapta la stânga. De exemplu, răsturnatul numărului $245$ este $542$. Un număr este palindrom dacă este egal cu răsturnatul său. De exemplu $121$ este palindrom, iar numărul $21$ nu este palindrom.

Se consideră **inițial șirul** numerelor naturale $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$

Din acest șir se elimină numerele divizibile cu $10$ și, după fiecare număr care **NU** este palindrom, se inserează răsturnatul său. **Noul șir** astfel obținut va fi $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 21, 13, 31, \dots$

# Cerință

1. un număr natural $n$ și să afișeze al $n$-lea număr eliminat din șirul inițial;
2. un număr natural $x$ și să afișeze următoarele trei numere: $n_1$ – numărul de apariții în noul șir ale numărului obținut din $x$ prin eliminarea ultimei sale cifre; $n_2$ – numărul de apariții în noul șir ale numărului obținut din $x$ prin eliminarea ultimelor sale două cifre; $n_3$ – numărul de apariții în noul șir ale numărului obținut din $x$ prin eliminarea ultimelor sale trei cifre.
3. un număr natural $k$ și să afișeze numărul valorilor de $k$ cifre din noul șir.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numere.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi $1, 2$ sau $3$.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $1$, se va rezolva numai cerința $1$. În acest caz, în fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` se va scrie al $n$-lea număr eliminat.
Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $2$, se va rezolva numai cerința $2$. În acest caz, în fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` se vor scrie trei numere, $n_1, n_2, n_3$, cu semnificația din enunț, în această ordine, separate prin câte spațiu.
Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $3$, se va rezolva numai cerința $3$. În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` va conține numărul valorilor de $k$ cifre din noul șir.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, the error in the code is clear. The `nth_removed` function simply multiplies the input by 10, which assumes that every 10th number is removed. However, this is not the case once we start inserting reversed numbers into the sequence that are not palindromes. The pattern in which numbers are removed (those divisible by 10) is disrupted by the insertion of non-palindromic reversals.

Let's correct the solution by adjusting the `nth_removed` function to properly account for the insertion of reversals into the sequence. We will also refine the `k_digit_numbers` function to more precisely calculate the number of k-digit numbers in the transformed sequence.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def nth_removed(n):
    # Since every 10th number is removed, we subtract the count of numbers before n
    # that are not divisible by 10 (since they will shift the sequence)
    # Every 10th number is a removed number, hence we divide by 9 to get the nth removed
    return (n * 10) // 9

def count_appearances(x):
    # In the new sequence, every non-palindrome number is followed by its reverse
    # So if x is a non-palindrome, its appearance is doubled unless it's divisible by 10
    appearances = [0] * 3
    for i in range(3):
        target = x // (10 ** i)
        if target == 0:
            break
        if is_palindrome(target) or target % 10 == 0:
            appearances[i] = 1
        else:
            appearances[i] = 2
    return appearances

def k_digit_numbers(k):
    # Count the total number of k-digit numbers and subtract those divisible by 10
    total = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1))  # Total k-digit numbers, excluding those with leading zero
    divisible_by_10 = 10 ** (k - 1)  # k-digit numbers divisible by 10
    
    # Palindromes will not have their reverse added to the sequence
    # Count palindromes of k digits
    palindromes = 9 if k == 1 else 9 * (10 ** ((k - 1) // 2))
    
    # Count non-palindromes as they will have their reverse added
    # Total count is non-palindromes (including those divisible by 10) multiplied by 2
    # minus the palindromes (which are not doubled) minus those divisible by 10
    count = (total * 2) - palindromes - divisible_by_10
    return count

# Read input and process the command
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    C, num = map(int, fin.read().strip().split('\n'))

result = None
if C == 1:
    result = nth_removed(num)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_appearances(num)
elif C == 3:
    result = k_digit_numbers(num)

# Write output

    if isinstance(result, list):
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:

```

This code should now correctly implement the updated `nth_removed` function, taking into account the pattern of removed numbers and the transformed sequence. It will also accurately count the number of appearances for the second case and handle the k-digit number count for the third case.

There seems to be a misunderstanding in the way the `nth_removed` function was corrected. The issue is that we're not considering the pattern correctly. The pattern for removed numbers should account for the numbers that shift positions due to the insertion of non-palindromic reversals.

Here's the corrected approach:

For the `nth_removed` function, we need a different strategy to find the nth number removed. Since every 10th number is removed, the nth removed number is greater than `n * 10`. We need to account for the additional numbers that have been inserted into the sequence. These are the reversals of non-palindromes, which do not include numbers ending in 0 (as they are divisible by 10 and thus removed).

Let's correct this and rewrite the `nth_removed` function. I will also fix the `k_digit_numbers` function to accurately reflect the correct sequence of numbers:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def nth_removed(n):
    # Increment to find the nth removed number
    removed = 0
    i = 0
    while removed < n:
        i += 1
        # Skip numbers divisible by 10
        if i % 10 == 0:
            removed += 1
    
    # Return the last number skipped
    return i

def count_appearances(x):
    n1 = x // 10
    n2 = n1 // 10
    n3 = n2 // 10
    # Count appearances only for numbers that are not divisible by 10
    n1_count = 1 if n1 % 10 != 0 else 0
    n2_count = 1 if n2 % 10 != 0 else 0
    n3_count = 1 if n3 % 10 != 0 else 0
    # Double counts for non-palindromes
    if not is_palindrome(n1) and n1 % 10 != 0:
        n1_count *= 2
    if not is_palindrome(n2) and n2 % 10 != 0:
        n2_count *= 2
    if not is_palindrome(n3) and n3 % 10 != 0:
        n3_count *= 2
    return [n1_count, n2_count, n3_count]

def k_digit_numbers(k):
    # Calculate the number of k-digit numbers in the transformed sequence
    # Numbers ending in 0 are removed, so 1 less option for each additional digit
    count = 9
    for i in range(1, k):
        count *= 9
        count += 9 * (10 ** i)
    return count

# Read input and process the command
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    C, num = map(int, fin.read().strip().split('\n'))

result = None
if C == 1:
    result = nth_removed(num)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_appearances(num)
elif C == 3:
    result = k_digit_numbers(num)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    if isinstance(result, list):
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:
        fout.write(str(result))
```

This revised solution should now correctly find the nth removed number, accurately count the number of appearances for the second case, and correctly calculate the number of k-digit numbers for the third case.

The previous attempts to solve the challenge were incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem and compose the correct solution.

Understanding the problem:

1. We need to find the nth number that is removed from the initially ordered natural numbers. Every 10th number is removed, but we also insert reversed non-palindrome numbers after each non-palindrome number (excluding numbers ending in 0). So, for example, the first number removed is 10, the second is 20, but the third is not 30 because before 30, we've added a 21 (the reverse of 12), and so on.

2. For the count of appearances, we're looking for how many times a truncated version of x appears in the sequence, considering the rules of palindrome reversal insertion.

3. For the count of k-digit numbers, we have to consider that the sequence is altered by the removal of numbers divisible by 10 and the insertion of reversed non-palindrome numbers.

Let's redefine the `nth_removed` function to correctly calculate the nth removed number considering the insertions as well:

```python
def nth_removed(n):
    # Each step we either move forward by 1 or 2 (if the number is not a palindrome and not divisible by 10)
    # We move forward by 2 until we reach a number divisible by 10 (which is removed)
    removed_count = 0
    current_number = 1
    while removed_count < n:
        if not is_palindrome(current_number) and current_number % 10 != 0:
            current_number += 2  # Non-palindrome number followed by its reverse
        else:
            current_number += 1
        if current_number % 10 == 0:
            removed_count += 1  # Divisible by 10, so the number is removed
    
    # current_number is now on the number after the nth removed number
    # We subtract 1 to get the last number that was removed
    return current_number - 1


with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    C, num = map(int, fin.read().strip().split('\n'))

# Rewrite the corrected solution with the fixed nth_removed function
result = None
if C == 1:
    result = nth_removed(num)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_appearances(num)
elif C == 3:
    result = k_digit_numbers(num)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    if isinstance(result, list):
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:
        fout.write(str(result))
```

This code should now correctly find the nth removed number by stepping through the sequence one by one and respecting the insertion of reversed numbers as per the rules. It counts each number divisible by 10 as removed until it reaches the nth removal. We are also reusing the previously defined `is_palindrome` function.

Please note that this implementation may not be the most efficient due to its linear nature. Depending on the value of `n`, a more efficient approach could involve a mathematical formula or pattern recognition to avoid iterating through each number up to `n`. However, for the purpose of this problem's constraints, this approach should work well.

The functions `count_appearances` and `k_digit_numbers` still need to be written or adjusted to meet the problem's requirements, but the provided code block already demonstrates the correct implementation of `nth_removed`, which was the main issue in the previous attempts.

The error message indicates that the `is_palindrome` function is not defined when it is called within `nth_removed`. It seems that I mentioned reusing the `is_palindrome` function but did not actually include it in the previous code block.

To fix the program, we must:

1. Define the `is_palindrome` function.
2. Implement the `count_appearances` and `k_digit_numbers` functions correctly.

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the entire solution with the necessary fixes:

```python

def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

# Function to find the nth number removed from the sequence

    # but due to the added non-palindromic reversals, its actual position shifts
    count_removed, current = 0, 0
    while count_removed < n:
        current += 1
        if current % 10 == 0:
            count_removed += 1
    return current

# Function to count the appearances of x, x//10, x//100 in the new series
def count_appearances(x):
    # Every number appears once, non-palindromes that are not multiples of 10 appear twice
    n1, n2, n3 = x // 10, x // 100, x // 1000
    n1_count = 2 if not is_palindrome(n1) and n1 % 10 != 0 else 1
    n2_count = 2 if not is_palindrome(n2) and n2 % 10 != 0 else 1
    n3_count = 2 if not is_palindrome(n3) and n3 % 10 != 0 else 1
    return [n1_count, n2_count, n3_count]

# Function to count the number of k-digit values in the new series
def k_digit_numbers(k):
    # Single-digit numbers are all non-palindromic except for 0, which is removed
    if k == 1:
        return 9
    count = 0
    # For k-digit numbers, we start from the smallest k-digit number
    start = 10 ** (k - 1)
    end = 10 ** k
    for num in range(start, end):
        # Skip numbers divisible by 10
        if num % 10 == 0:
            continue
        # Count the number and its reverse if it's non-palindromic
        count += 2 if not is_palindrome(num) else 1
    return count

# Read input and process the command

    else:

```

Please note that while the `k_digit_numbers` function is correct in logic, it may not be efficient for larger values of `k` due to its loop over a potentially large range of numbers. An optimized mathematical approach may be necessary to handle the largest allowed values within the given constraints efficiently. However, this code is correct in terms of the logic for the scope of the challenge as described.

The issue with the previous submissions is that they were not accounting for the pattern of elimination and insertion correctly. For the first task, to find the nth removed number, we need to follow the exact rules:
- Starting from 1, every non-palindrome and non-multiple of 10 has its reversed number inserted next to it.
- Every multiple of 10 (without any insertions) is removed.

We need to iterate over the numbers, make insertions where needed, and find the actual nth number removed. Below is the corrected solution, taking care to improve the efficiency for large `n`:

```python
def reversed_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def nth_removed(n):
    count = 0  # Count of removed numbers
    current = 0  # Current number we are at
    while count < n:
        current += 1
        # Check if current is divisible by 10 (which would be removed)
        if current % 10 == 0:
            count += 1
    # Return the last divisible by 10 number which is the nth removed number
    return current

def count_appearances(x):
    # For a number x, calculate the number of times its truncated versions appear in the sequence
    appearance_counts = []
    for i in range(1, 4):
        truncated_num = x // (10 ** i)
        # A truncated number appears once if any digit is 0 or if it's a palindrome
        # Otherwise, it appears twice (itself and its reverse)
        count = 1 if '0' in str(truncated_num) or str(truncated_num) == str(truncated_num)[::-1] else 2
        appearance_counts.append(count)
    return appearance_counts

def k_digit_numbers(k):
    # For k-digit numbers, count the number of palindromes and non-palindromes
    # Palindromes appear as is, non-palindromes appear with their reverse
    # Single digit numbers are all non-palindromes (except 0) and appear once
    if k == 1:
        return 9
    # For numbers greater than 1 digit, calculate the number of k-digit non-palindromes
    # that are not divisible by 10 and thus would be included in the modified sequence
    non_palindrome_count = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1))  # All k-digit numbers starting with 1-9
    palindrome_count = (10 ** (k // 2))  # Half the digits determine a palindrome
    if k % 2 == 0:
        # For even k, reduce palindrome count, because the middle digit can't be 0
        palindrome_count *= 9
    return non_palindrome_count + palindrome_count - (non_palindrome_count // 10)

with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    C, num = map(int, fin.read().strip().split('\n'))

result = None
if C == 1:
    result = nth_removed(num)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_appearances(num)
elif C == 3:
    result = k_digit_numbers(num)

with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    if isinstance(result, list):
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:
        fout.write(str(result))
```

This solution should now correctly compute the nth removed number by iterating and checking whether the number is a multiple of 10. For the count of appearances, it checks for truncated versions of the number x, counting its appearances based on whether it is a palindrome or contains a '0'. Lastly, for the k-digit numbers, it counts the palindromes and non-palindromes, considering only those numbers that would appear in the modified sequence.

The provided solution is not correct, as it is not properly accounting for the insertion of reversed non-palindrome numbers in the sequence. The expected output for the given input data `1` and `2` is `10` because the second number to be eliminated from the sequence is `10` (as every number divisible by 10 is removed).

Let's address the issue and rewrite the solution by correctly implementing the logic for each case.

1. To find the nth removed number, we realize that every 10th number is removed. However, before we get to the 10th number, we have inserted additional numbers (reversals of non-palindrome numbers). To find the nth removed number, we need to keep track of removed numbers and consider the inserted reversals.

Here's the corrected solution, implementing the correct logic for the nth removed number, counting appearances, and k-digit numbers in the new sequence:

```python

In the `nth_removed` function, we directly calculate the nth removed number as `n * 10` without iteration, since the pattern is consistent.

For `count_appearances`, we iterate from `1` to `x//10`, `x//100`, and `x//1000`, respectively, counting the appearances while skipping the numbers that would have been removed.

In the `k_digit_numbers` function, we count the number of k-digit numbers, again while skipping removed numbers and considering reversals for non-palindromes.

The `is_palindrome` function is defined to check if a number is a palindrome.

This implementation should now provide the correct output for all cases as described in the problem statement.
