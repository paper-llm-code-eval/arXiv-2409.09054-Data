În cel mai recent eveniment al companiei Tesla, Paul Musk a anunțat un nod produs inovativ: parcarea autonomă. Fiind cunoscut pentru lansările produselor incomplete, nici parcarea nu este completă, fiind nevoie de o automatizare pentru a atribui câte un loc mașinilor care vor să folosească parcarea.
\
Parcarea este formată din $N$ locuri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, și este deschisă timp de $T$ secunde, începând cu secunda $1$.
Pe parcursul zilei, sosesc $M$ mașini care vor să folosească parcarea, pentru fiecare dintre acestea știindu-se timpul de sosire $s_i$ și timpul de plecare $p_i$. Mașinile vin în ordinea timpului de sosire $s_i$ și ocupă locul de parcare în intervalul de timp $[s_i, p_i]$. Pentru fiecare dintre acestea, trebuie să afișați un loc liber de parcare (dacă sunt mai multe, se poate afișa oricare) în care aceasta se poate așeza sau $−1$ dacă parcarea este plină în momentul venirii mașinii. Dacă o mașină nu are loc în parcare la timpul de sosire, aceasta nu va mai intra în parcare la niciun timp viitor.

La final, Paul este interesat de mașinile care mai sunt rămase în parcare la închiderea parcării, de aceea, vă cere să afișați configurația parcării la timpul $T$.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsesc trei numere întregi $N$, $M$ și $T$, reprezentând numărul de locuri din parcare, numărul de mașini care vin să folosească parcarea, respectiv numărul de secunde pentru care este deschisă parcarea.

Următoarele $M$ linii conțin fiecare câte două numere întregi $s_i$, $p_i$, reprezentând venirea unei mașini la secunda $s_i$ care va pleca la secunda $p_i$.

Mașinile apar în fișierul de intrare în ordine crescătoare după timpul de sosire $s_i$.

# Date de ieșire
Se vor afișa $M + 1$ linii în total, primele $M$ linii conținând fiecare câte un număr întreg între $1$ și $N$ reprezentând locul de parcare pe care îl va ocupa mașina, sau $−1$ dacă nu există niciun loc de parcare disponibil.

Ultima linie va conține $N$ numere întregi, reprezentând configurația parcării la închidere, unde cel de-al $i$-lea număr reprezintă **timpul de sosire** al mașinii de pe locul de parcare $i$, sau $−1$ dacă locul de parcare $i$ este gol.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N, M, T \leq 200\ 000$
- $1 \leq s_i \leq T$
- $1 \leq s_i \lt p_i \leq 200\ 000$
- Considerând următoarele $2 \times M$ valori: $s_1, s_2, ..., s_M, p_1, p_2, ..., p_M$, acestea sunt distincte două câte două.
- **Dacă există mai multe soluții, se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.**
- Pentru 24 de puncte, $s_i + 1 = p_i$, adică fiecare mașină stă exact o secundă.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $p_i \gt s_j$, adică toate mașinile vin înainte ca vreo mașină să plece.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru 24 de puncte, se respectă restricțiile inițiale.

The expected output suggests that the parking allocation algorithm is expected to return different parking slots than what was originally implemented. The original solution fills the parking slots sequentially, while the expected output indicates that the parking slots should be filled based on availability at the time of each car's arrival, regardless of the parking slot index order.

To match the expected output, we need to keep track of the departure times of the cars and assign the next incoming car to the first available slot that is free at its arrival time. This requires a data structure that allows for efficient queries and updates of the parking slots' states. A heap (priority queue) can be an appropriate data structure for this purpose since it allows for efficiently finding the minimum departure time (and hence the next free slot).

Let's fix the solution by using a heap to track parking slot availability:

```python
import heapq

# Read data from file
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M, T = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

# Create a heap to store the parking spaces and their availability
available_slots = [(0, i) for i in range(1, N + 1)]  # (departure_time, slot_number)
heapq.heapify(available_slots)
parking_result = [-1] * M  # Store the parking spot for each car or -1 if not available
final_parking_config = [-1] * N  # Store the arrival time for each parking spot at time T

# Process the cars
for i, (arrival, departure) in enumerate(cars):
    # Find an available spot
    while available_slots and available_slots[0][0] < arrival:
        heapq.heappop(available_slots)
    
    if available_slots:
        (departure_time, spot) = heapq.heappop(available_slots)
        parking_result[i] = spot
        heapq.heappush(available_slots, (departure, spot))
        final_parking_config[spot - 1] = arrival
    else:
        parking_result[i] = -1

# Update the final parking configuration for slots that are empty at time T
for i in range(N):
    if final_parking_config[i] != -1 and parking_lot[i + 1] <= T:
        final_parking_config[i] = -1

# Writing the results to file
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write('\n'.join(map(str, parking_result)) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, final_parking_config)) + '\n')
```

This solution uses a min-heap to keep the available parking slots sorted by their departure time. When a car arrives, it pops slots from the heap until it finds one that is available, assigns the car to that slot, and pushes the slot back into the heap with the updated departure time. It also tracks the final parking configuration, making sure to output the arrival time for cars still parked at time T, or -1 for empty slots.

The previous solution is incorrect and does not match the expected output. The mistake is in the process of allocating parking slots. The heap approach is not implemented correctly, leading to all cars not being allocated a slot. Moreover, the final parking configuration for slots that are empty at time T is not being updated correctly.

Let's correct the solution with a working algorithm that takes into account the specifics of the problem. We will use a min-heap to track the availability of parking slots based on their departure times. Each parking slot will be represented by a tuple (departure time, slot number). We will also maintain a list to track the occupancy of each slot at time T.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
import heapq

# Read data from file
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M, T = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

# Create a heap to store the parking spaces and their availability
available_slots = [(0, i) for i in range(1, N + 1)]  # (departure_time, slot_number)
occupied_slots = [0] * (N + 1)  # Track occupancy at time T
heapq.heapify(available_slots)
parking_result = [-1] * M  # Store the parking spot for each car or -1 if not available

# Process the cars
for i, (arrival, departure) in enumerate(cars):
    # Clean up slots that have become available
    while available_slots and available_slots[0][0] <= arrival:
        _, slot = heapq.heappop(available_slots)
        if occupied_slots[slot] < arrival:
            occupied_slots[slot] = 0

    # Allocate a slot if available
    slot = next((slot for time, slot in available_slots if occupied_slots[slot] == 0), None)
    if slot is not None:
        heapq.heappush(available_slots, (departure, slot))
        parking_result[i] = slot
        occupied_slots[slot] = departure

# Prepare the final parking configuration
final_parking_config = [-1 if time <= T else cars[slot-1][0] for slot, time in enumerate(occupied_slots)]

# Writing the results to file
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.writelines(f"{res}\n" for res in parking_result)
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, final_parking_config[1:])) + '\n')
```

This solution ensures that each parking slot is only allocated to the incoming car if it is actually free at the time of arrival. It also correctly updates the final parking configuration with the arrival times of the cars that are still in the slots at time T or -1 if the slot is empty. This should produce the expected output as stated in the problem description.

It seems that there is a logical error in the previous solution when it comes to allocating parking slots. The use of the heap was incorrect, and the final parking configuration was also not handled properly. Let's fix the solution by using a simpler approach with a list to track the available parking spots and their next free time.

We will maintain an array to track the next free time for each parking slot and use it to allocate slots to cars as they arrive. When a car departs, we will update the corresponding slot's next free time.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M, T = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

# Array to track the next free time for each parking slot, initialized to 0.
next_free_time = [0] * (N + 1)  # 1-indexed

# List to store the parking slot allocated to each car, or -1 if no slot is available.
parking_result = []

# Process each car
for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Find the first available parking slot
    slot_allocated = False
    for slot in range(1, N + 1):
        if next_free_time[slot] < arrival:
            next_free_time[slot] = departure
            parking_result.append(slot)
            slot_allocated = True
            break
    
    # If no slot was available, append -1 to parking_result
    if not slot_allocated:
        parking_result.append(-1)

# Prepare the final parking configuration, showing the arrival time of cars still parked
# or -1 for empty slots at time T.
final_parking_config = [-1] * N
for i, (arrival, departure) in enumerate(cars):
    slot = parking_result[i]
    if slot != -1 and departure > T:
        final_parking_config[slot - 1] = arrival

# Write the results to file
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.writelines(f"{slot}\n" for slot in parking_result)
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, final_parking_config)) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution should now provide the expected output. It allocates parking slots to cars based on the first available slot at the time of their arrival and updates the final parking configuration with the arrival times of cars still parked at the end of the parking period (time T) or -1 for empty slots.

It appears that the previous solutions did not correctly match the expected output due to errors in allocating parking slots. To achieve the expected result, we need to assign parking spots based on availability at the time of each car's arrival, while also considering the correct final parking configuration at time T.

Here is a new approach, which ensures that cars are allocated to the first available slot that is free at their arrival time and that the final parking configuration reflects the arrival times of cars still parked at time T.

```python
# Read data from file
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M, T = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    arrivals_departures = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

# Initialize parking spots with a departure time of 0 to indicate they're initially free
parking_spots = [0] * N

# List to store the parking slot allocated to each car, or -1 if no slot was available
parking_results = []

# Process arrivals and departures
for i, (arrival, departure) in enumerate(arrivals_departures):
    # Find the first available parking spot
    spot_found = False
    for j in range(N):
        if parking_spots[j] < arrival:
            parking_spots[j] = departure
            parking_results.append(j + 1)
            spot_found = True
            break
    
    # If no spot was available, append -1
    if not spot_found:
        parking_results.append(-1)

# Determine final parking configuration at time T
final_parking_config = [-1] * N
for i, (arrival, departure) in enumerate(arrivals_departures):
    if parking_results[i] != -1 and departure > T:
        final_parking_config[parking_results[i] - 1] = arrival

# Write the results to file
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.writelines(f"{res}\n" for res in parking_results)
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, final_parking_config)) + '\n')
```

This solution tracks the next available time for each parking spot in `parking_spots`. It assigns each arriving car to the first spot that will be free at its arrival time and updates the leave time for that spot. At the end, it constructs the final parking configuration, marking the arrival times of cars that are still parked at time T or -1 if the spot is empty.

The expected output should now be correctly produced by the solution.

The provided code still does not produce the expected output because it does not follow the expected allocation strategy. The expected output indicates that the first car takes the second spot, the second car takes the first spot, and the third car again takes the second spot. The current algorithm is not prioritizing higher-indexed spots when multiple spots are available. To achieve the expected result, we need to allocate the highest-indexed available spot to each arriving car.

Let's rewrite the solution with a correct implementation that prioritizes allocating the highest possible spot number for each arriving car:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M, T = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

# Initialize parking spots with a departure time of 0 to indicate they're initially free
parking_spots = [0] * (N + 1)  # 1-indexed

# Process arrivals and departures
parking_results = []
for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Starting from the highest-indexed spot, find the first available parking spot
    for spot in range(N, 0, -1):
        if parking_spots[spot] < arrival:
            parking_spots[spot] = departure
            parking_results.append(spot)
            break
    else:
        # No parking spot is available
        parking_results.append(-1)

# Determine final parking configuration at time T, considering only cars that haven't left
final_parking_config = [-1 if parking_spots[i] <= T else i for i in range(1, N + 1)]

# Write the results to file
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.writelines(f"{spot}\n" for spot in parking_results)
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, final_parking_config)) + '\n')
```

This revised solution starts checking for available spots from the end of the `parking_spots` list, which ensures that we allocate the highest possible spot number to each car. Additionally, it correctly constructs the final parking configuration by only considering cars that haven't left at time T. This should give us the expected output.

The output differs from the expected result in the final parking configuration at time T. The previous code incorrectly assigns spot numbers instead of the arrival times of the cars parked in those spots. We should track which car occupies each spot and then output the arrival time for each spot at time T.

Let's fix the solution to correctly handle the final parking configuration:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M, T = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

# Initialize parking spots with a departure time of 0 to indicate they're initially free
# and -1 for the arrival time of the car occupying the spot
parking_spots = [(0, -1)] * (N + 1)  # 1-indexed

# Process arrivals and departures
parking_results = []
for index, (arrival, departure) in enumerate(cars):
    # Starting from the highest-indexed spot, find the first available parking spot
    for spot in range(N, 0, -1):
        if parking_spots[spot][0] < arrival:
            parking_spots[spot] = (departure, arrival)
            parking_results.append(spot)
            break
    else:
        # No parking spot is available
        parking_results.append(-1)

# Determine final parking configuration at time T
final_parking_config = [
    parking_spots[spot][1] if parking_spots[spot][0] > T else -1 for spot in range(1, N + 1)
]

# Write the results to file
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.writelines(f"{spot}\n" for spot in parking_results)
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, final_parking_config)) + '\n')
```

In this corrected solution, each parking spot is a tuple containing the departure time of the car occupying it and the arrival time of that car. When we construct the final parking configuration, we look at the departure times to determine if a car is still parked at time T. If it is, we output the arrival time of that car; otherwise, we output -1. This should produce the correct expected output.
