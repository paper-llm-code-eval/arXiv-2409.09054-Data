În cel mai recent eveniment al companiei Tesla, Paul Musk a anunțat un nod produs inovativ: parcarea autonomă. Fiind cunoscut pentru lansările produselor incomplete, nici parcarea nu este completă, fiind nevoie de o automatizare pentru a atribui câte un loc mașinilor care vor să folosească parcarea.
\
Parcarea este formată din $N$ locuri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, și este deschisă timp de $T$ secunde, începând cu secunda $1$.
Pe parcursul zilei, sosesc $M$ mașini care vor să folosească parcarea, pentru fiecare dintre acestea știindu-se timpul de sosire $s_i$ și timpul de plecare $p_i$. Mașinile vin în ordinea timpului de sosire $s_i$ și ocupă locul de parcare în intervalul de timp $[s_i, p_i]$. Pentru fiecare dintre acestea, trebuie să afișați un loc liber de parcare (dacă sunt mai multe, se poate afișa oricare) în care aceasta se poate așeza sau $−1$ dacă parcarea este plină în momentul venirii mașinii. Dacă o mașină nu are loc în parcare la timpul de sosire, aceasta nu va mai intra în parcare la niciun timp viitor.

La final, Paul este interesat de mașinile care mai sunt rămase în parcare la închiderea parcării, de aceea, vă cere să afișați configurația parcării la timpul $T$.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsesc trei numere întregi $N$, $M$ și $T$, reprezentând numărul de locuri din parcare, numărul de mașini care vin să folosească parcarea, respectiv numărul de secunde pentru care este deschisă parcarea.

Următoarele $M$ linii conțin fiecare câte două numere întregi $s_i$, $p_i$, reprezentând venirea unei mașini la secunda $s_i$ care va pleca la secunda $p_i$.

Mașinile apar în fișierul de intrare în ordine crescătoare după timpul de sosire $s_i$.

# Date de ieșire
Se vor afișa $M + 1$ linii în total, primele $M$ linii conținând fiecare câte un număr întreg între $1$ și $N$ reprezentând locul de parcare pe care îl va ocupa mașina, sau $−1$ dacă nu există niciun loc de parcare disponibil.

Ultima linie va conține $N$ numere întregi, reprezentând configurația parcării la închidere, unde cel de-al $i$-lea număr reprezintă **timpul de sosire** al mașinii de pe locul de parcare $i$, sau $−1$ dacă locul de parcare $i$ este gol.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N, M, T \leq 200\ 000$
- $1 \leq s_i \leq T$
- $1 \leq s_i \lt p_i \leq 200\ 000$
- Considerând următoarele $2 \times M$ valori: $s_1, s_2, ..., s_M, p_1, p_2, ..., p_M$, acestea sunt distincte două câte două.
- **Dacă există mai multe soluții, se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.**
- Pentru 24 de puncte, $s_i + 1 = p_i$, adică fiecare mașină stă exact o secundă.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $p_i \gt s_j$, adică toate mașinile vin înainte ca vreo mașină să plece.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru 24 de puncte, se respectă restricțiile inițiale.

    else:

# Free up parking spaces after the parking lot has closed
for space in range(N):

    file.write('\n'.join(output_lines) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in parking_lot) + '\n')

This solution uses a list to keep track of available parking spaces and a dictionary to keep track of the occupied spaces and their departure times. After processing all cars, it updates the parking lot for any spaces that would still be occupied after the parking lot has closed. The solution then writes the parking assignments for each car, followed by the final configuration of the parking lot to 'parcare.out'.

The error occurs because we are attempting to access a key in the `occupied_spaces` dictionary using a value from the `available_spaces` list, which assumes that every item in `available_spaces` has a corresponding key in `occupied_spaces`. This might not be the case. We should only check the dictionary for keys that are known to be occupied.

Let's fix the code by ensuring that we check the occupancy of a parking space correctly. We don't need to maintain a separate heap or list for available spaces, as we can simply iterate over the parking lot to find a free space. We will use a heap to keep track of the departure times and associated parking spaces that will become available.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
import heapq

# Read the input data from 'parcare.in'
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, T = map(int, file.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

# Initialize the parking lot and the heap for departure times
parking_lot = [-1] * N
departure_heap = []

# Process the car arrivals and departures
output_lines = []

for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Free up parking spaces where cars have already left
    while departure_heap and departure_heap[0][0] < arrival:
        free_time, space = heapq.heappop(departure_heap)
        parking_lot[space] = -1

    # Assign a parking space to the current car, if available
    space_assigned = False
    for space in range(N):
        if parking_lot[space] == -1:
            parking_lot[space] = arrival
            heapq.heappush(departure_heap, (departure, space))
            output_lines.append(str(space + 1))  # Spaces are 1-indexed in output
            space_assigned = True
            break

    if not space_assigned:
        output_lines.append(str(-1))

# Final parking lot configuration
final_parking_lot = [-1 if spot > T else spot for spot in parking_lot]

# Write the output data to 'parcare.out'
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write('\n'.join(output_lines) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in final_parking_lot) + '\n')
```

This updated solution uses a priority queue (heap) to keep track of the departure times. When a car arrives, it pops cars from the heap until it finds a free space or determines the parking lot is full. It then writes the results to 'parcare.out'.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, we can see that the output does not match the expected car parking assignments, nor does it match the final parking lot configuration at time T.

The main issue with the previous solution is that it wrongly assumed that cars leave the parking lot in the order of their parking space index, when in fact they leave based on their departure time, regardless of their parking space index.

To fix this, we should maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to track the earliest departure times across all parking spaces, and when freeing up a parking space, we should do so only for the car whose departure time has passed, not just by iterating over parking spaces.

Let's reimplement the solution with a correct approach to use a min-heap for departure times and their associated parking spaces:

```python
import heapq

# Read the input data from 'parcare.in'
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, T = map(int, file.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

# Initialize the parking lot and the heap for departure times
parking_lot = [-1] * N
departure_heap = []
free_spaces = list(range(N))  # List of free parking spaces

# Process the car arrivals and departures
output_lines = []

for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Free up parking spaces where cars have already left
    while departure_heap and departure_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
        _, space = heapq.heappop(departure_heap)
        free_spaces.append(space)

    # Assign a parking space to the current car, if available
    if free_spaces:
        space = free_spaces.pop()
        parking_lot[space] = arrival
        heapq.heappush(departure_heap, (departure, space))
        output_lines.append(str(space + 1))  # Spaces are 1-indexed in output
    else:
        output_lines.append(str(-1))

# Prepare final parking lot configuration
final_parking_lot = [-1 if spot == -1 or spot > T else spot for spot in parking_lot]

# Write the output data to 'parcare.out'
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write('\n'.join(output_lines) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in final_parking_lot) + '\n')
```

This revised solution correctly uses a priority queue to manage car departures and their associated parking spaces. The output should now properly reflect the car parking assignments and the final parking lot configuration at time T.

Upon examining the found output, we can see that the assignments of parking spaces to the cars are correct, but the final parking lot configuration is incorrect. Specifically, the final configuration states that the car that arrived at time 4 is still in the parking lot at time T (6), which should not be the case because that car has a departure time of 6.

The error in the code is that we're checking if the parking spot is `-1` or if the arrival time is greater than `T`, but this doesn't correctly account for the cars that have a departure time equal to `T`. These cars should also be considered as having left the parking lot by time `T`.

Let's fix the final parking lot configuration logic to handle cars that leave exactly at time `T`:

```python
import heapq

# Read the input data from 'parcare.in'
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, T = map(int, file.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

# Initialize the parking lot and the heap for departure times
parking_lot = [-1] * N
departure_heap = []
free_spaces = list(range(N))  # List of free parking spaces

# Process the car arrivals and departures
output_lines = []

for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Free up parking spaces where cars have already left
    while departure_heap and departure_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
        _, space = heapq.heappop(departure_heap)
        free_spaces.append(space)

    # Assign a parking space to the current car, if available
    if free_spaces:
        space = free_spaces.pop()
        parking_lot[space] = arrival
        heapq.heappush(departure_heap, (departure, space))
        output_lines.append(str(space + 1))  # Spaces are 1-indexed in output
    else:
        output_lines.append(str(-1))

# Prepare final parking lot configuration by considering departure times at exactly T
final_parking_lot = [-1 if spot == -1 or (spot in departure_heap and departure_heap[spot][0] <= T) else spot for spot in parking_lot]

# Write the output data to 'parcare.out'
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write('\n'.join(output_lines) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(str(spot if spot != -1 else -1) for spot in final_parking_lot) + '\n')
```

The fixed solution now correctly checks whether the departure time of the car is less than or equal to `T`, and if so, marks that parking space as free. This should result in the correct final configuration of the parking lot at time `T`, matching the expected output.

Upon further examination, I realize that the previous solution is still incorrectly calculating the final parking lot configuration. The error lies in this line:

```python
final_parking_lot = [-1 if spot == -1 or (spot in departure_heap and departure_heap[spot][0] <= T) else spot for spot in parking_lot]
```

The condition `(spot in departure_heap and departure_heap[spot][0] <= T)` is incorrect as `departure_heap` is a list of tuples, not a dictionary, and thus we can't access values by key (`spot` in this case). What we need to do is check all departure times in the heap and compare them to `T`. A car should be considered as having left if its departure time is less than or equal to `T`.

We can simplify the final parking lot configuration by just looking at the departure_heap after processing all cars and marking any spots as empty if their departure time is less than or equal to `T`. Let's fix the final configuration calculation:

```python
import heapq

# Read the input data from 'parcare.in'
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, T = map(int, file.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

# Initialize the parking lot and the heap for departure times
parking_lot = [-1] * N
departure_heap = []
free_spaces = list(range(N))  # List of free parking spaces

# Process the car arrivals and departures
output_lines = []

for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Free up parking spaces where cars have already left
    while departure_heap and departure_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
        _, space = heapq.heappop(departure_heap)
        parking_lot[space] = -1
        free_spaces.append(space)

    # Assign a parking space to the current car, if available
    if free_spaces:
        space = free_spaces.pop(0)  # Get the first free space
        parking_lot[space] = arrival
        heapq.heappush(departure_heap, (departure, space))
        output_lines.append(str(space + 1))  # Spaces are 1-indexed in output
    else:
        output_lines.append(str(-1))

# Free up parking spaces for cars that leave at time T
while departure_heap and departure_heap[0][0] <= T:
    _, space = heapq.heappop(departure_heap)
    parking_lot[space] = -1

# Write the output data to 'parcare.out'
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write('\n'.join(output_lines) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(str(spot if spot != -1 else -1) for spot in parking_lot) + '\n')
```

The final parking lot configuration is now determined after processing all cars, by popping any remaining cars from the departure heap that have a departure time less than or equal to `T` and marking those parking spaces as empty. This should produce the correct output as expected.

The differences between the expected and the found result indicate an incorrect assignment of parking spaces to arriving cars as well as the incorrect final state of the parking lot. Specifically, the assignments for the arriving cars are in the wrong order and the final parking lot configuration is incorrectly marking all spaces as empty.

The key issue with the previous implementation is that it does not handle the assignment of parking spaces correctly. It should use the space that becomes available first, and the final parking lot configuration should display the arrival time of the car that is still parked at time `T` or `-1` if the space is empty.

Let's correct the solution with the following steps:

1. Maintain a min-heap of free spaces sorted by the departure time of the car parked there.
2. When a car arrives, check the heap for the earliest available space and assign it if possible. If no space is available, indicate that with `-1`.
3. At the end, the final parking lot configuration should list the arrival times of cars that haven't left by time `T` or `-1` for empty spaces.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import heapq

# Read the input data from 'parcare.in'
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, T = map(int, file.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

# Initialize the parking lot with all spots free and a min-heap for free spaces
parking_lot = [-1] * N
free_spaces_heap = [(0, i) for i in range(N)]  # (departure_time, space_index)

# Process the car arrivals and assign parking spaces
output_lines = []
for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Remove spaces from heap that are free at the arrival time
    while free_spaces_heap and free_spaces_heap[0][0] < arrival:
        heapq.heappop(free_spaces_heap)

    # Assign the next available space if there is one
    if free_spaces_heap:
        _, space = heapq.heappop(free_spaces_heap)
        parking_lot[space] = arrival
        output_lines.append(str(space + 1))
        heapq.heappush(free_spaces_heap, (departure, space))
    else:
        output_lines.append("-1")

# Final parking lot configuration at time T
final_config = []
for departure, space in free_spaces_heap:
    if departure > T:
        final_config.append((space, parking_lot[space]))
final_config.sort()  # Sort by space index
final_parking_lot = [-1] * N
for space, arrival in final_config:
    final_parking_lot[space] = arrival

# Write the output data to 'parcare.out'
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write("\n".join(output_lines) + "\n")
    file.write(" ".join(str(x) for x in final_parking_lot) + "\n")
```

This solution should now correctly assign parking spaces to cars and calculate the final parking lot configuration, adhering to the problem's constraints and expected output.

The differences between the expected and found result indicate that no parking spaces were assigned to any car, which is incorrect. The problem lies in the condition used to pop the free spaces from the min-heap. The condition `free_spaces_heap[0][0] < arrival` should actually be `free_spaces_heap[0][0] <= arrival` to ensure that spaces are freed up for cars arriving at the exact time another car leaves.

Let's correct the code by fixing this condition and properly implementing the final parking lot configuration. Also, we need to make sure we are considering the departure times correctly when calculating the final configuration.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import heapq

# Read the input data from 'parcare.in'
with open('parcare.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, T = map(int, file.readline().split())
    cars = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

# Initialize the parking lot and the heap for available parking spaces
parking_lot = [-1] * N
occupied_spaces = [(0, i) for i in range(N)]  # (departure_time, space_index)
heapq.heapify(occupied_spaces)

# Process the car arrivals and departures
output_lines = []

for arrival, departure in cars:
    # Free up parking spaces where cars have already left
    while occupied_spaces and occupied_spaces[0][0] <= arrival:
        heapq.heappop(occupied_spaces)

    # Assign a parking space to the current car, if available
    if occupied_spaces:
        _, space = heapq.heappop(occupied_spaces)
        parking_lot[space] = arrival
        heapq.heappush(occupied_spaces, (departure, space))
        output_lines.append(str(space + 1))  # 1-indexed for output
    else:
        output_lines.append("-1")

# Prepare the final parking lot configuration
final_parking_lot = [-1 if departure <= T else arrival for departure, arrival in sorted(occupied_spaces + [(0, arrival) for arrival in parking_lot])]

# Write the output data to 'parcare.out'
with open('parcare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write("\n".join(output_lines) + "\n")
    file.write(" ".join(str(x) for x in final_parking_lot) + "\n")
```

In this solution, we maintain a min-heap of parking spaces based on the departure times of the cars currently occupying them. When a space is freed, it's made available for the next arriving car. After processing all arrivals, we construct the final parking lot configuration based on the cars' departure times, ensuring that only the cars that have not left by time `T` are included, and their arrival times are reported. This solution should match the expected output.
