În cel mai recent eveniment al companiei Tesla, Paul Musk a anunțat un nod produs inovativ: parcarea autonomă. Fiind cunoscut pentru lansările produselor incomplete, nici parcarea nu este completă, fiind nevoie de o automatizare pentru a atribui câte un loc mașinilor care vor să folosească parcarea.
\
Parcarea este formată din $N$ locuri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, și este deschisă timp de $T$ secunde, începând cu secunda $1$.
Pe parcursul zilei, sosesc $M$ mașini care vor să folosească parcarea, pentru fiecare dintre acestea știindu-se timpul de sosire $s_i$ și timpul de plecare $p_i$. Mașinile vin în ordinea timpului de sosire $s_i$ și ocupă locul de parcare în intervalul de timp $[s_i, p_i]$. Pentru fiecare dintre acestea, trebuie să afișați un loc liber de parcare (dacă sunt mai multe, se poate afișa oricare) în care aceasta se poate așeza sau $−1$ dacă parcarea este plină în momentul venirii mașinii. Dacă o mașină nu are loc în parcare la timpul de sosire, aceasta nu va mai intra în parcare la niciun timp viitor.

La final, Paul este interesat de mașinile care mai sunt rămase în parcare la închiderea parcării, de aceea, vă cere să afișați configurația parcării la timpul $T$.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsesc trei numere întregi $N$, $M$ și $T$, reprezentând numărul de locuri din parcare, numărul de mașini care vin să folosească parcarea, respectiv numărul de secunde pentru care este deschisă parcarea.

Următoarele $M$ linii conțin fiecare câte două numere întregi $s_i$, $p_i$, reprezentând venirea unei mașini la secunda $s_i$ care va pleca la secunda $p_i$.

Mașinile apar în fișierul de intrare în ordine crescătoare după timpul de sosire $s_i$.

# Date de ieșire
Se vor afișa $M + 1$ linii în total, primele $M$ linii conținând fiecare câte un număr întreg între $1$ și $N$ reprezentând locul de parcare pe care îl va ocupa mașina, sau $−1$ dacă nu există niciun loc de parcare disponibil.

Ultima linie va conține $N$ numere întregi, reprezentând configurația parcării la închidere, unde cel de-al $i$-lea număr reprezintă **timpul de sosire** al mașinii de pe locul de parcare $i$, sau $−1$ dacă locul de parcare $i$ este gol.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N, M, T \leq 200\ 000$
- $1 \leq s_i \leq T$
- $1 \leq s_i \lt p_i \leq 200\ 000$
- Considerând următoarele $2 \times M$ valori: $s_1, s_2, ..., s_M, p_1, p_2, ..., p_M$, acestea sunt distincte două câte două.
- **Dacă există mai multe soluții, se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.**
- Pentru 24 de puncte, $s_i + 1 = p_i$, adică fiecare mașină stă exact o secundă.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $p_i \gt s_j$, adică toate mașinile vin înainte ca vreo mașină să plece.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru 24 de puncte, se respectă restricțiile inițiale.

def assign_parking_spots(file_in, file_out):
    # Read input data
    with open(file_in, 'r') as f:
        N, M, T = map(int, f.readline().split())
        cars = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]
    
    # Parking lot initialization
    parking_lot = [-1] * N

    parking_spot_avail = list(range(N))  # List of available parking spots
    car_parking_assignments = []

    # Iterate over cars and assign parking
    for arrival, departure in cars:
        assigned_spot = -1  # Assume initially that there is no spot available

        for i in range(len(parking_spot_avail)):
            spot = parking_spot_avail[i]
            if parking_time[parking_lot[spot]] < arrival:
                assigned_spot = spot
                parking_spot_avail.pop(i)
                break
        
        car_parking_assignments.append(assigned_spot + 1 if assigned_spot != -1 else -1)

        if assigned_spot != -1:
            parking_lot[assigned_spot] = arrival
            parking_time[arrival] = departure
        
        # Free up parking spots for cars that have left
        for i in range(N):
            if parking_time[parking_lot[i]] == arrival:
                parking_spot_avail.append(i)

    # Write output data
    with open(file_out, 'w') as f:
        for assignment in car_parking_assignments:
            f.write(f"{assignment}\n")
        f.write(" ".join(str(parking_lot[i] if parking_lot[i] != -1 else -1) for i in range(N)))

# Call the function with the given file names
assign_parking_spots('parcare.in', 'parcare.out')
```
The solution above reads the parking lot size (N), the number of cars (M), and the open time (T) from a file named `parcare.in`. It then reads the arrival and departure times for each of the M cars.

It initializes the parking lot as a list of -1s (indicating empty spots) and a list `parking_spot_avail` containing indices of all available spots. As cars come in, the code checks for available spots against arrival times and assigns the first available spot. The `parking_time` list is updated to track when spots will become available again.

When a car leaves, its spot is made available again. At the end of the day (time T), the final parking lot configuration is determined and written to `parcare.out`. The output file contains M + 1 lines, where the first M lines indicate the assigned parking spot for each car, and the last line indicates the final parking lot configuration.

Upon examining the original solution and comparing it with the expected output, it's clear that the logic for tracking available parking spots and freeing spots when cars leave is incorrect. The `parking_time` list does not accurately track the departure times for occupied spots which causes the code to incorrectly determine available spots.

A more appropriate way to track available spots is to use a priority queue (or heap) that stores the departure time and the index of the parking spot. When a car leaves, the corresponding spot should be freed up for future cars to use. This ensures that the soonest available spots are always considered first.

Here is the rewritten solution that applies the necessary fixes:

```python
import heapq

def assign_parking_spots(file_in, file_out):
    # Read input data
    with open(file_in, 'r') as f:
        N, M, T = map(int, f.readline().split())
        cars = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

    # Parking lot initialization
    parking_lot = [-1] * N
    parking_heap = []  # Heap of available parking spots
    car_parking_assignments = []

    for spot in range(N):
        heapq.heappush(parking_heap, (0, spot))  # All spots are initially available

    # Assign parking spots to cars
    for arrival, departure in cars:
        # Free up parking spots for cars that have left by their departure time
        while parking_heap and parking_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
            heapq.heappop(parking_heap)

        # Assign a spot to the arriving car
        if parking_heap:
            _, spot = heapq.heappop(parking_heap)
            parking_lot[spot] = arrival
            car_parking_assignments.append(spot + 1)
            heapq.heappush(parking_heap, (departure, spot))
        else:
            car_parking_assignments.append(-1)  # No spot available

    # Write output data
    with open(file_out, 'w') as f:
        for assignment in car_parking_assignments:
            f.write(f"{assignment}\n")
        f.write(" ".join(str(parking_lot[i] if parking_lot[i] != -1 else -1) for i in range(N)))

# Call the function with the given file names
assign_parking_spots('parcare.in', 'parcare.out')
```

In this updated solution, we're using a heap to keep track of available parking spots based on their next available time. When a car arrives, we pop from the heap until we find a spot that is available at the current arrival time. Then we assign the spot to the car and push the spot back into the heap with the updated departure time.

This should provide the correct assignments and final parking configuration, matching the expected output.

It seems the previous solution didn't output the expected result because the heap was being cleared too aggressively. In the while loop, the condition `while parking_heap and parking_heap[0][0] <= arrival:` will pop all parking spots that have a departure time less than or equal to the arrival time of the current car. However, this does not correctly simulate cars leaving one by one, freeing their spots. We should only pop from the heap when the departure time of the top element (earliest available parking spot) is less than or equal to the arrival time of the current car.

Let's correct this by adjusting the popping condition, and also make sure that the spots are being made available at the correct times.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import heapq

def assign_parking_spots(file_in, file_out):
    # Read input data
    with open(file_in, 'r') as f:
        N, M, T = map(int, f.readline().split())
        cars = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

    # Parking lot initialization
    parking_lot = [-1] * N
    parking_heap = []  # Heap of available parking spots with their next available time
    for i in range(N):
        heapq.heappush(parking_heap, (0, i))  # Initially all spots are available immediately

    # Iterate over cars and assign parking spots
    with open(file_out, 'w') as f:
        for arrival, departure in cars:
            # Free up parking spots for cars that have left
            while parking_heap and parking_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
                _, spot = heapq.heappop(parking_heap)
                if parking_lot[spot] != -1 and parking_lot[spot] < arrival:
                    parking_lot[spot] = -1  # Set to -1 if the car has left the spot

            # Find a free parking spot
            assigned_spot = -1
            if parking_heap:
                _, spot = heapq.heappop(parking_heap)
                if parking_lot[spot] == -1:
                    # Assign the car to the parking spot
                    parking_lot[spot] = arrival
                    assigned_spot = spot + 1
                # Put the spot back onto the heap with the updated time
                heapq.heappush(parking_heap, (departure, spot))

            # Write the assigned spot for the car to the output file
            f.write(f"{assigned_spot}\n")

        # Write the final parking lot configuration to the output file
        final_parking_config = [str(parking_lot[i] if parking_lot[i] != -1 else -1) for i in range(N)]
        f.write(" ".join(final_parking_config))

# Call the function with the given file names
assign_parking_spots('parcare.in', 'parcare.out')
```

This updated solution uses a priority queue (heap) to manage the availability of parking spots based on when cars leave. When a spot becomes available, it is marked as such only if the current time is after the departure time of the car that occupied it, ensuring that spots are freed one by one. The car is assigned the first available spot, and the output is written to the file according to the expected format.

The previous solution still contains errors, as it is not properly freeing up and reassigning parking spots, and it populates the heap incorrectly when a spot is taken. Let's address these issues step by step:

1. We should push a parking spot onto the heap only when a car leaves.
2. We should check the availability of parking spots based on current time and departure time of the cars that have taken the spots.

Let's correct the code with these adjustments in mind:

```python
import heapq

def assign_parking_spots(file_in, file_out):
    # Read input data
    with open(file_in, 'r') as f:
        N, M, T = map(int, f.readline().split())
        cars = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

    # Parking lot initialization
    parking_lot = [-1] * N  # Represents which car is parked (-1 if empty)
    parking_heap = [(0, i) for i in range(N)]  # Heap of available parking spots
    heapq.heapify(parking_heap)

    # Process car arrivals
    car_parking_assignments = [-1] * M  # Default is -1 if no spot is found
    for car_index, (arrival, departure) in enumerate(cars):
        # Free up parking spots for cars that have left so far
        while parking_heap and parking_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
            _, spot = heapq.heappop(parking_heap)
            if parking_lot[spot] != -1:  # If the spot was used
                parking_lot[spot] = -1  # Mark as available

        # Assign the next available spot to the car
        if parking_heap:
            _, spot = heapq.heappop(parking_heap)
            parking_lot[spot] = arrival
            car_parking_assignments[car_index] = spot + 1
            heapq.heappush(parking_heap, (departure, spot))  # Mark the spot as used until departure

    # Write output to the file
    with open(file_out, 'w') as f:
        for assignment in car_parking_assignments:
            f.write(f"{assignment}\n")
        # Write the parking lot configuration at closing time
        final_config = [arrival if arrival > 0 else -1 for arrival in parking_lot]
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, final_config)))

# Call the function with the given file names
assign_parking_spots('parcare.in', 'parcare.out')
```

This code should now work correctly:

1. The heap is initialized with all parking spots available immediately.
2. For each arriving car, we free parking spots by popping from the heap until we find a spot available at or before the current arrival time.
3. We assign the next available parking spot to the current car.
4. We push the parking spot back to the heap with its new availability time set to the current car's departure time.
5. Finally, we print the car assignments and the final parking lot configuration.

Upon reviewing the previous solution, I see that there is a mistake in the way we're handling the heap. Each parking spot should be initially available from time 0, and we should only push back the spot to the heap when a car leaves, not when it arrives and takes a spot. It seems that spots are not being properly freed and re-assigned to arriving cars.

Let's fix the code by correctly handling parking spot availability and ensuring we maintain a list of current cars in the parking lot with their departure times so we can free up spots as they leave.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import heapq

def assign_parking_spots(file_in, file_out):
    # Read input data
    with open(file_in, 'r') as f:
        N, M, T = map(int, f.readline().split())
        cars = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

    # Initialize parking spots and a min-heap for managing departure times
    parking_lot = [-1] * N  # Represents the arrival times of cars in spots
    departures_heap = []  # Min-heap for the next available times of parking spots

    # Process cars
    car_parking_assignments = []
    for arrival, departure in cars:
        # Free up parking spots of cars that have left by now
        while departures_heap and departures_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
            _, spot = heapq.heappop(departures_heap)
            parking_lot[spot] = -1  # The spot becomes available

        # Try to find an available parking spot
        spot_assigned = False
        for spot in range(N):
            if parking_lot[spot] == -1:
                parking_lot[spot] = arrival  # Mark the spot as taken
                heapq.heappush(departures_heap, (departure, spot))
                car_parking_assignments.append(spot + 1)
                spot_assigned = True
                break
        
        if not spot_assigned:
            car_parking_assignments.append(-1)  # No spot available

    # Write output data
    with open(file_out, 'w') as f:
        for assignment in car_parking_assignments:
            f.write(f"{assignment}\n")

        # Write the final configuration of the parking lot
        final_config = [str(arrival if spot != -1 else -1) for spot, arrival in enumerate(parking_lot)]
        f.write(' '.join(final_config) + '\n')

# Call the function with the given file names
assign_parking_spots('parcare.in', 'parcare.out')
```

In this solution, we:

1. Use a heap to keep track of the departure times and associated parking spots. When a car leaves, the corresponding parking spot is freed.
2. Iterate through the list of cars, checking available spots and assigning them if possible. If a car cannot be parked, we append -1 to `car_parking_assignments`.
3. Write the assignment for each car to `parcare.out`, followed by the final configuration of the parking lot at the closing time.

This solution should produce the correct output as expected.

The output differs from the expected output because when we iterate over the parking spots to find an available one, we are not respecting the order of the parking spot indices as given in the input. We should use the available spots in ascending order as they become free, and also ensure that when a car leaves, the parking spot is updated correctly.

Let's fix the solution by maintaining a list of available spots that gets updated as cars arrive and depart. We'll still use a heap to track the next available times of the parking spots, but we'll also check the list of available spots to find the lowest-indexed one for each arriving car.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import heapq

def assign_parking_spots(file_in, file_out):
    # Read input data
    with open(file_in, 'r') as f:
        N, M, T = map(int, f.readline().split())
        cars = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]

    # Initialize parking spots and a min-heap for managing departure times
    parking_lot = [-1] * N  # Represents the arrival times of cars in spots
    departures_heap = []  # Min-heap for the departure times of parked cars
    available_spots = list(range(N))  # List of available parking spots

    # Process cars
    car_parking_assignments = []
    for arrival, departure in cars:
        # Free up parking spots of cars that have left by now
        while departures_heap and departures_heap[0][0] <= arrival:
            _, spot = heapq.heappop(departures_heap)
            available_spots.append(spot)  # The spot becomes available
            available_spots.sort()  # Ensure spots are in ascending order

        # Try to find an available parking spot
        if available_spots:
            spot = available_spots.pop(0)  # Use the lowest-indexed available spot
            parking_lot[spot] = arrival  # Mark the spot as taken
            heapq.heappush(departures_heap, (departure, spot))
            car_parking_assignments.append(spot + 1)
        else:
            car_parking_assignments.append(-1)  # No spot available

    # Write output data
    with open(file_out, 'w') as f:
        for assignment in car_parking_assignments:
            f.write(f"{assignment}\n")

        # Write the final configuration of the parking lot
        final_config = [parking_lot[i] if parking_lot[i] != -1 else -1 for i in range(N)]
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, final_config)) + '\n')

# Call the function
assign_parking_spots('parcare.in', 'parcare.out')
```

This corrected solution should now:

1. Use the heap to track when spots become available.
2. Use the `available_spots` list to assign cars to spots in ascending order of spot indices.
3. Correctly free up spots and maintain the `available_spots` list in sorted order.
4. Write the assignment for each car to `parcare.out`, and then write the final configuration of the parking lot at the closing time.

This solution should now produce the correct output as expected.

I apologize for the confusion. The issue in the previous solutions was not correctly managing the availability of parking spots and not freeing them in the order of the time the spots become available.

To fix the solution, the code must:

1. Keep a list or a heap of available parking spots, ensuring to sort or manage them efficiently to always assign the lowest numbered spot available.
2. Track when each spot will be available based on the departure times of the cars currently parked.
3. As cars arrive, find the lowest numbered spot available that will be free at the arrival time.

Let's attempt to write a correct solution:

```python
import heapq

def assign_parking_spots(file_in, file_out):
    # Read input data
    with open(file_in, 'r') as f:
        N, M, T = map(int, f.readline().split())
        events = []
        for i in range(M):
            s_i, p_i = map(int, f.readline().split())
            events.append((s_i, 'arrival', i))
            events.append((p_i, 'departure', i))
        events.sort()

    # Initialize
    available_spots = list(range(N))  # All parking spots are initially available
    car_parking_spot = [-1]*M  # Assign -1 for cars that cannot park
    parking_lot = [-1]*N  # Track the arrival time of the car at each spot

    # Process events
    for time, event_type, car_idx in events:
        if event_type == 'arrival':
            if available_spots:  # If there are available spots
                # Assign the first available spot (lowest number)
                spot = available_spots.pop(0)
                car_parking_spot[car_idx] = spot
                parking_lot[spot] = time  # Mark the spot with the arrival time
        else:  # departure
            spot = car_parking_spot[car_idx]
            if spot != -1:  # If the car had parked
                # Free the spot and add it back to the list of available spots
                parking_lot[spot] = -1
                available_spots.append(spot)
                available_spots.sort()  # Keep available spots sorted

    # Write output data
    with open(file_out, 'w') as f:
        for spot in car_parking_spot:
            f.write(f"{spot + 1 if spot != -1 else -1}\n")
        # Final configuration of the parking lot
        final_config = [str(parking_lot[i] if parking_lot[i] != -1 else -1) for i in range(N)]
        f.write(' '.join(final_config) + '\n')

# Call the function
assign_parking_spots('parcare.in', 'parcare.out')
```

This solution uses an events list to track all arrivals and departures, sorted by time. As we process each event, we either assign an available parking spot to an arriving car or free a spot when a car departs. The available parking spots are maintained in a sorted list, so we always assign the lowest numbered spot that is available. The parking lot list tracks the arrival time of the car at each spot, which we use to output the final configuration of the parking lot.
