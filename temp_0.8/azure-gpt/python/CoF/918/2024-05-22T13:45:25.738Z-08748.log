It appears that the initial algorithm to compute the end of the first subsequence and the start of the second subsequence did not account for the spiral nature of the matrix. 

The spiraling nature creates a pattern where the top-right corner (where the first subsequence ends) moves to the bottom-left as $n$ increases. Similarly, the bottom-left corner (where the second subsequence starts) moves to the bottom-right in an $n \times n$ matrix.

To fix the solution, we need to determine the positions based on this spiral pattern. Let's attempt to derive a formula for the positions based on the input $n$. For an $n \times n$ matrix, the length of each subsequence is $(n^2) / 2$. To get the exact position of the desired elements, we can simulate the spiral movement until we reach the target index.

Here is an improved solution that keeps track of the direction of the spiral and calculates the positions accordingly:

```python
def calculate_positions(n):
    # The length of the subsequence
    half_len = n * n // 2

    # Start at the top left corner
    x, y = 1, 1

    # Spiral direction vectors (right, down, left, up)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    direction_index = 0

    # Number of steps in the current direction
    steps = 1

    # The current number in the spiral and the current leg of the spiral
    num = 1
    leg = 0

    while num < half_len:
        # Change direction after two legs
        if leg == 2:
            leg = 0
            steps += 1

        # Determine the number of steps to take in the current direction
        step_count = steps if num + steps <= half_len else half_len - num

        # Update the position and the number
        dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
        x += dx * step_count
        y += dy * step_count
        num += step_count

        # Prepare for the next leg
        direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4
        leg += 1

    # The position of the largest term in the first subsequence
    first_seq_end_pos = (x, y)

    # The smallest term in the second subsequence is at the beginning of the next leg
    direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4
    dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
    second_seq_start_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)

    return first_seq_end_pos, second_seq_start_pos

# Read from the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Calculate the positions
first_seq_end_pos, second_seq_start_pos = calculate_positions(n)

# Write to the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{first_seq_end_pos[0]} {first_seq_end_pos[1]}\n")
    fout.write(f"{second_seq_start_pos[0]} {second_seq_start_pos[1]}\n")
```

This solution now takes into consideration the spiral traversal and should produce the correct output for the given input.

It seems that the corrected solution is still incorrect. The algorithm does not correctly handle the spiral traversal in order to find the end position of the first subsequence and the start position of the second subsequence within the matrix.

In the given 5x5 matrix example, the first half of the spiral (values 1 to 12) ends at position (5, 2), and the second half starts at (4, 1). If we observe the pattern, we notice that for an $n \times n$ matrix:

- The largest element of the first subsequence is always on the bottom row of the lower-left quadrant (or just left of the center for odd $n$), which is at position $(n, (n/2) + 1)$ if $n$ is even, or $(n, (n+1)/2)$ if $n$ is odd.
- The smallest element of the second subsequence is always one position to the left of the largest element of the first subsequence, which is at position $(n-1, (n/2))$ if $n$ is even, or $(n, (n+1)/2 - 1)$ if $n$ is odd.

We can use this observation to calculate the correct positions without simulating the whole spiral traversal. Let's implement the new logic:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Calculate positions based on pattern observation
if n % 2 == 0:
    # n is even
    first_seq_end_row = n
    first_seq_end_col = n // 2
    second_seq_start_row = n
    second_seq_start_col = (n // 2) + 1
else:
    # n is odd
    first_seq_end_row = n
    first_seq_end_col = (n // 2) + 1
    second_seq_start_row = n
    second_seq_start_col = (n // 2)

# Write to the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{first_seq_end_row} {first_seq_end_col}\n")
    fout.write(f"{second_seq_start_row} {second_seq_start_col}\n")
```

Now, this solution should correctly compute the positions based on the observed pattern and without simulating the entire spiral. It should be much more efficient and provide the correct answer for any given $n$.

The latest solution is still not accurate. The computation of the columns for both the end of the first subsequence and the start of the second subsequence was incorrect. 

For an $n \times n$ matrix:

- The largest element of the first subsequence is indeed in the bottom row for both even and odd $n$. However, the column for odd $n$ is not correctly computed.
- The smallest element of the second subsequence starts at the position directly left of the largest element of the first subsequence only for even $n$. For odd $n$, it starts from the leftmost column of the row above the bottom row.

Let us re-evaluate and fix the solution based on a more thorough analysis:

For the given problem, the largest term of the first subsequence ends at the bottom-left quadrant of the matrix, which is the leftmost position of the bottom row for an odd-sized spiral or one position left of the center of the bottom row for an even-sized spiral.

- When $n$ is odd, the largest term of the first subsequence is at position $(n, (n + 1)/2)$.
- When $n$ is even, the largest term of the first subsequence is at position $(n, n/2)$.

The smallest term of the second subsequence starts at the top-right quadrant of the matrix, which is the first position of the row just above the exact center for an odd-sized spiral, or the center position itself for an even-sized spiral.

- When $n$ is odd, the smallest term of the second subsequence is at position $((n + 1)/2, (n + 1)/2)$.
- When $n$ is even, the smallest term of the second subsequence is at position $(n/2 + 1, n/2 + 1)$.

Let's implement the correct logic in the solution:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Calculate positions based on pattern observation
if n % 2 == 0:
    # n is even
    first_seq_end_pos = (n, n // 2)
    second_seq_start_pos = (n // 2 + 1, n // 2 + 1)
else:
    # n is odd
    first_seq_end_pos = (n, (n + 1) // 2)
    second_seq_start_pos = ((n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)

# Write to the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{first_seq_end_pos[0]} {first_seq_end_pos[1]}\n")
    fout.write(f"{second_seq_start_pos[0]} {second_seq_start_pos[1]}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now provide the expected output, as it correctly identifies the positions for both subsequences based on the dimensions of the matrix.

After evaluating the previous solutions and their outputs, we can see that they were incorrect based on the misunderstanding of the spiral matrix pattern. Let's correct the algorithm by carefully inspecting the given example and the properties of the spiral matrix.

For an $n \times n$ matrix:

- The largest term of the first subsequence is actually in the bottom row of the left half of the matrix. For odd $n$, this position is $\left(n, \frac{n+1}{2}\right)$, as the subsequence ends exactly at the center of the bottom row. For example, in a $5 \times 5$ matrix, the largest term of the first subsequence is $12$, which is at position $(5, 3)$.
- For odd $n$, the smallest term of the second subsequence is in the center of the matrix, which is the next element in the spiral after the largest term of the first subsequence. Therefore, for the example with $n = 5$, this position is $\left(\frac{n+1}{2}, \frac{n+1}{2}\right)$, which is $(3, 3)$, but the element we are looking for is one step before in the spiral, so we have to move one step in the reverse direction to the left, leading us to position $(3, 2)$, which is the center of the left edge of the matrix. Because we want the smallest term of the second subsequence, which is $14$ for $n = 5$, we actually have to take one step up and one step to the left from the center, which leads us to the position $(4, 1)$.

Therefore, the correct formula for the positions based on $n$ is:

For an odd $n$:
- The largest term of the first subsequence is at $(n, \frac{n+1}{2})$.
- The smallest term of the second subsequence is at $(n-1, 1)$.

For an even $n$, this formula needs to be adjusted accordingly, but as the problem statement specifies that for 45 points, $n$ is odd, we'll focus on the odd $n$ case.

Let's fix the implementation based on this new understanding:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Calculate positions based on the corrected understanding for odd n
if n % 2 == 1:
    # For odd values of n
    first_seq_end_pos = (n, (n + 1) // 2)
    second_seq_start_pos = (n - 1, 1)
else:
    # For even values of n (not required for 45 points)
    # Placeholder logic, requires further analysis
    first_seq_end_pos = (n, n // 2)
    second_seq_start_pos = (n // 2, 1)

# Write to the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{first_seq_end_pos[0]} {first_seq_end_pos[1]}\n")
    fout.write(f"{second_seq_start_pos[0]} {second_seq_start_pos[1]}\n")
```

Now the solution should be correct for odd values of $n$, which is the condition for 45 points stated in the problem. The computation for even $n$ remains a placeholder as the question specifically asked for the odd $n$ case, which covers the example given.

The previous solution still produced an incorrect result because the calculation of the column for the largest term of the first subsequence was incorrect. 

For an odd $n$, the center of the matrix is $(\frac{n+1}{2}, \frac{n+1}{2})$. For the example with $n = 5$, this is $(3, 3)$. The first subsequence fills the matrix spirally and ends just before it would reach the center on the bottom row. This means that the column for the largest term of the first subsequence should be to the left of the center (not at the center as previously calculated).

We need to find the element in the bottom row that corresponds to the end of the first half of the sequence (which contains value $1$). This element is in the left half of the row, specifically at column index $(n+1)/2$. Since we're considering the largest term of the first subsequence, we need to move one cell to the left, resulting in the column index being $(n+1)/2 - 1$.

The smallest term of the second subsequence, which contains value $n^2$, starts at the top-right quadrant and continues to spiral. This term is one step after the center on the last pass of the spiral. In the example with $n = 5$, the center is $(3, 3)$, and the spiral continues to the left, so the smallest term of the second subsequence is one step to the left and one step down from the center, at position $(4, 2)$.

The correct implementation is:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Calculate positions based on the corrected understanding
if n % 2 == 1:
    # For odd values of n
    first_seq_end_pos = (n, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)
    second_seq_start_pos = (n - 1, 1)
else:
    # For even values of n
    # If n is even, the first subsequence would end in the bottom row, n/2 columns from the left
    # The second subsequence would start in the row just above the middle at the far right column
    first_seq_end_pos = (n, n // 2)
    second_seq_start_pos = (n // 2, n)

# Write to the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{first_seq_end_pos[0]} {first_seq_end_pos[1]}\n")
    fout.write(f"{second_seq_start_pos[0]} {second_seq_start_pos[1]}\n")
```

With these corrected formulas, the solution should now provide the expected output for both odd and even $n$. The problem statement specifies a scenario for odd $n$ for 45 points, which is covered by this solution. However, I also provided a general approach for even $n$ for completeness.

The previous solutions had a misunderstanding of the spiral traversal and the positioning of the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence. The latest solution also provided incorrect logic for even values of $n$. Let's analyze the problem again and provide a corrected solution.

Considering an $n \times n$ spiral matrix, we observe the following:

For an odd $n$:
- The spiral ends exactly at the center of the matrix, which for odd $n$ is at $\left(\frac{n+1}{2}, \frac{n+1}{2}\right)$.
- The last element of the first subsequence (which contains the number 1) is on the bottom row, exactly one column to the left of the center of the matrix. Therefore, its position is $(n, \frac{n+1}{2} - 1)$.
- The first element of the second subsequence (which contains the number $n^2$) is exactly one row above the last element of the first subsequence and at the first column. Therefore, its position is $(n - 1, 1)$.

For an even $n$:
- The spiral ends at the center cell of the top-right quadrant of the matrix, which for even $n$ is at $\left(\frac{n}{2}, \frac{n}{2} + 1\right)$.
- The last element of the first subsequence is on the bottom row, exactly at the center column of the matrix. Therefore, its position is $(n, \frac{n}{2} + 1)$.
- The first element of the second subsequence is one column to the right of the last element of the first subsequence, still on the bottom row. Therefore, its position is $(n, \frac{n}{2} + 2)$.

Let's implement this corrected logic:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Calculate positions based on the spiral pattern observation
if n % 2 == 1:  # n is odd
    first_seq_end_row = n
    first_seq_end_col = (n + 1) // 2 - 1  # One column to the left of the center
    second_seq_start_row = n - 1
    second_seq_start_col = 1  # First column
else:  # n is even
    first_seq_end_row = n
    first_seq_end_col = n // 2 + 1  # Center column of the matrix
    second_seq_start_row = n
    second_seq_start_col = n // 2 + 2  # One column to the right of the end of the first subsequence

# Write to the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{first_seq_end_row} {first_seq_end_col}\n")
    fout.write(f"{second_seq_start_row} {second_seq_start_col}\n")
```

This solution should now accurately compute the positions for both the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence for any given $n$, whether it is odd or even.
