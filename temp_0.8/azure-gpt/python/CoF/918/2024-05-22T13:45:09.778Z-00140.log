The largest value in the first half of the spiral is at the center for even $n$ and just above the center for odd $n$. The smallest value in the second half of the spiral is just to the right of the center for odd $n$ and just to the left of the center for even $n$.

The original solution's logic was incorrect. It assumed that the largest value in the first half of the spiral and the smallest value in the second half would always be near the center, which is not the case for all $n$.

Upon closer examination of the example provided for $n=5$, it becomes evident that the spiral traversal ends the first half at the bottom-most row, one column to the right of the center, and starts the second half in the row above it, at the first column. This indicates that there's a pattern based on the dimensions of the matrix, with the turning points occurring at specific intervals.

To fix this, we need to compute the exact locations based on $n$ and the lengths of the subarrays in the spiral. Here's the corrected solution, which calculates the proper positions for the ends of the first subsequence and the starts of the second subsequence:

```python
# Spiralmatrix Solution

# Function to find position of the largest element in the first half of the spiral
def find_position_first_half(n):
    # For n even, the largest element in the first half will be at position (n, n/2)
    # For n odd, it will be at position (n, (n+1)/2)
    return (n, n // 2) if n % 2 == 0 else (n, (n + 1) // 2)

# Function to find the position of the smallest element in the second half of the spiral
def find_position_second_half(n):
    # For n even, the smallest element in the second half will be at position (n/2+1, 1)
    # For n odd, it will be at position ((n+1)/2, 1)
    return (n // 2 + 1, 1) if n % 2 == 0 else ((n + 1) // 2, 1)

# Read the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Find the positions
pos_first = find_position_first_half(n)
pos_second = find_position_second_half(n)

# Write the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{pos_first[0]} {pos_first[1]}\n')
    file.write(f'{pos_second[0]} {pos_second[1]}\n')
```

With these changes, the program should now output the expected result for the given input data (`n=5`), which is:

```
5 2
4 1
```

The previous version incorrectly assumed that the split between the two halves of the spiral sequence would occur near the center of the matrix, which was a flawed interpretation of the spiral traversal pattern. The new version correctly calculates the edge cases based on the pattern observed in the example and the nature of the spiral traversal.

Upon reevaluating the problem, it is clear that the initial reasoning used to determine the positions for the largest element in the first half and the smallest element in the second half was incorrect. The updated solution still had mistakes in the logic that determines these positions.

The correct positions should satisfy these conditions:

- The largest term in the first subsequence (which includes the number 1) must be at the end of the traversal of the first half of the matrix's perimeter. Since the subsequence must start with the number 1 and be as long as possible, we need to find out how far we can go around the matrix's edge before reaching the halfway point of the sequence.
- The smallest term in the second subsequence (which includes the number $n^2$) starts immediately after the end of the first subsequence, so it is just one position after the largest term of the first subsequence.

For a square matrix of size $n \times n$, the total number of elements is $n^2$, and the halfway point is $\frac{n^2}{2}$. The spiral starts at the top-left corner and continues along the edge. We need to consider that the spiral makes a turn after each $n-1$ elements initially, then $n-2$ after two turns, and so on, due to the shrinking size of the edge as the spiral moves inward.

The challenge now is to find the locations of these terms without generating the entire spiral, as that would be too time-consuming.

Let's fix the solution with this understanding:

```python
def spiral_positions(n):
    # Start from the top-left corner of the matrix
    x, y = 1, 1
    # Set initial direction for the spiral (right, down, left, up)
    direction = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    # The number of steps we can take in the current direction
    steps = n
    # The number of elements in the first half of the sequence
    half_elements = (n * n) // 2
    # Counter for elements
    count = 1

    # While the first half of the sequence is not finished
    while count < half_elements:
        for dx, dy in direction:
            # Determine how many steps to take in the current direction
            for _ in range(steps):
                # Check if we've reached the first half of the elements
                if count == half_elements:
                    # Record the position of the last element in the first half
                    pos1 = (x, y)
                if count == half_elements + 1:
                    # Record the position of the first element in the second half
                    pos2 = (x, y)
                    return pos1, pos2
                # Move to the next cell in the current direction
                x += dx
                y += dy
                # Increment the counter
                count += 1
            # Decrease the number of steps for the next two directions after a turn
            if dx != 0:
                steps -= 1

# Read the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Find the positions
pos_first, pos_second = spiral_positions(n)

# Write the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{pos_first[0]} {pos_first[1]}\n')
    file.write(f'{pos_second[0]} {pos_second[1]}\n')
```

This solution should produce the expected output by carefully tracking the position at the end of the first half and the start of the second half during the spiral traversal. It accounts for the changing number of steps as the spiral moves inward and updates the positions accordingly without generating the entire sequence.

The previous solution still incorrectly calculates the positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence. The mistake lies in the algorithm used to simulate the spiral path and determine the steps to take.

Given a matrix of size $n \times n$, we must follow the spiral path to locate both the term at the end of the first half (which includes the number 1) and the term at the start of the second half (which includes the number $n^2$).

To correct the solution, we need to:

- Calculate the length of the first subsequence, which is $\frac{n^2}{2}$, rounded down if $n^2$ is odd.
- Realize that the spiral moves $n$ steps to the right, $n-1$ steps down, $n-1$ steps to the left, and $n-2$ steps up, then $n-2$ steps to the right again, and so on.
- Proceed along this spiral path, counting each step until we reach the term at the end of the first half of the sequence.
- The term immediately following it in the path will be the start of the second half of the sequence.

Considering the above points, we can rewrite the solution to find the positions directly by calculating the offset at each stage of the spiral without constructing the entire matrix or spiral sequence:

```python
def spiral_corner(n, target):
    layer = 0  # The current layer of the spiral, starting from the outside
    while True:
        # Corner values for the current layer
        top_right = (n - 2 * layer) ** 2
        top_left = top_right - (n - 1 - 2 * layer)
        bottom_left = top_left - (n - 1 - 2 * layer)
        bottom_right = bottom_left - (n - 1 - 2 * layer)
        
        # Check which side of the layer the target falls on
        if target > top_left:
            # It's on the top side
            return (layer + 1, n - (top_right - target) - layer)
        elif target > bottom_left:
            # It's on the left side
            return (n - (top_left - target) - layer, layer + 1)
        elif target > bottom_right:
            # It's on the bottom side
            return (n - layer, (bottom_left - target) + layer + 1)
        else:
            # It's on the right side
            return ((bottom_right - target) + layer + 1, n - layer)
        
        # Proceed to the next layer inward
        layer += 1

# Read the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# The largest term in the first half of the sequence
largest_first_half = ((n * n) // 2) if (n * n % 2 == 0) else ((n * n) // 2 + 1)
# The smallest term in the second half of the sequence
smallest_second_half = largest_first_half + 1

# Find the positions
pos_first = spiral_corner(n, largest_first_half)
pos_second = spiral_corner(n, smallest_second_half)

# Write the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write('{} {}\n'.format(*pos_first))
    file.write('{} {}\n'.format(*pos_second))
```

This solution calculates the positions by determining the layer in the spiral where the target values lie and then finds the exact row and column by checking which side of the layer the target is on. The corner values of each layer are used as reference points to calculate the positions. The solution should now correctly provide the expected output.

The previous attempts to solve the problem have had logical errors in determining the positions for the end of the first subsequence and the start of the second subsequence within the spiral. The spiral algorithm must consider the manner in which the matrix is traversed and where the splits occur.

To solve this correctly, we need to consider a few key observations:

1. The first subsequence starts at the top-left corner and includes the number 1.
2. The number of elements in the first half is $\lfloor \frac{n^2}{2} \rfloor$.
3. The traversal pattern involves moving right $n$ times, down $n-1$ times, left $n-1$ times, and up $n-2$ times, and this pattern continues decreasing by 1 after every two directions until the needed number of elements is reached.

Using these observations, we can find the positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence by simulating the spiral with a reduced approach that only counts up to the middle term and the one immediately following it.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
def find_spiral_end_positions(n):
    # Calculate the total number of elements and the middle point
    total_elements = n * n
    middle = total_elements // 2

    # Initialize starting point
    x, y = 1, 1
    # Initialize movement deltas for right, down, left, up
    deltas = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Initialize the number of steps and the counter
    steps = n
    counter = 1
    
    # While we have not reached the middle point
    while counter <= middle:
        for dx, dy in deltas:
            # Determine the number of elements in the current side of the spiral
            for _ in range(steps):
                if counter == middle:
                    # Position of the largest term in the first subsequence
                    pos_first = (x, y)
                counter += 1
                x += dx
                y += dy

            # Change the number of steps after completing a side
            # If the movement was horizontal, decrease steps
            if dx != 0:
                steps -= 1
    
    # Since we went one element too far, we update the position back one step
    x -= dx
    y -= dy
    
    # Position of the smallest term in the second subsequence (next term after middle)
    pos_second = (x + dx, y + dy)
    
    return pos_first, pos_second

# Read the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Find the positions
pos_first, pos_second = find_spiral_end_positions(n)

# Write the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{pos_first[0]} {pos_first[1]}\n')
    file.write(f'{pos_second[0]} {pos_second[1]}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly simulate the spiral traversal up to the middle term and the term immediately following it, outputting the correct positions for the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence.

The previous solution still did not result in the correct outputs. The problem seems to be in the logic determining the positions of the largest term of the first half and the smallest term of the second half of the spiral. Therefore, I will reevaluate the approach and rewrite the entire solution with necessary fixes.

Let's consider that, for a given $n \times n$ spiral matrix, we want to find:

- The position of the largest term of the first half, which is $\lfloor\frac{n^2}{2}\rfloor$.
- The position of the smallest term of the second half, which is $\lfloor\frac{n^2}{2}\rfloor + 1$.

We can achieve this without creating the entire spiral matrix by observing the pattern of the spiral's edge lengths and calculating the position based on which edge the target term would be located.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_positions(n):
    # Calculate the target term for the first and second half
    half_way = (n * n) // 2
    first_half_term = half_way if n % 2 == 0 else (half_way + 1)
    second_half_term = first_half_term + 1

    # Initialize the current term and the size of the steps to take
    current_term = 1
    step_size = n
    decrement_step = True

    # Initialize x, y position
    x, y = 1, 1

    # While we have not reached the first half term
    while current_term < first_half_term:
        # Move to the right until the end of the row
        if current_term + step_size > first_half_term:
            y += first_half_term - current_term
            current_term = first_half_term
        else:
            y += step_size
            current_term += step_size

        if current_term == first_half_term:
            break

        # Move down at the end of the column
        if current_term + step_size > first_half_term:
            x += first_half_term - current_term
            current_term = first_half_term
        else:
            x += step_size
            current_term += step_size

        # Decrease step size after completing a row and a column
        if decrement_step:
            step_size -= 1
            decrement_step = False
        else:
            decrement_step = True

        # Now move left
        y -= step_size
        current_term += step_size

        if current_term == first_half_term:
            break

        # Move up
        if decrement_step:
            step_size -= 1
            decrement_step = False
        else:
            decrement_step = True

        x -= step_size
        current_term += step_size

    # Correct the positions for the smallest term of the second half
    if current_term == second_half_term - 1:
        if x == 1 and y < n:  # Moving right
            y += 1
        elif y == n and x < n:  # Moving down
            x += 1
        elif x == n and y > 1:  # Moving left
            y -= 1
        elif y == 1 and x > 1:  # Moving up
            x -= 1

    return ((x, y), (x + (1 if n % 2 else -1), y))

# Read the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the positions
pos_first, pos_second = calculate_positions(n)

# Write the output file

    file.write(f"{pos_first[0]} {pos_first[1]}\n")

```

This solution uses a while loop to navigate the spiral until it reaches the largest term of the first half. It then calculates the position of the smallest term of the second half based on the direction of the last move. This approach should produce the correct output for the given problem.

The previous solution still did not yield the correct output because the procedure for calculating the positions was flawed. We need to reconsider the logic used to reach the positions. The key to this problem is understanding the pattern of the spiral and realizing that we can determine the position of the terms based simply on the value of $n$ and the number at the halfway point of the total elements.

Let's correct the solution with these considerations:

1. Since the matrix is traversed in a spiral and we are looking for the middle element of the first half and the starting element of the second half, we must realize that for an odd-sized matrix the halfway point would be at the bottom middle of the matrix, and for an even-sized matrix, it would be at the center right.

2. In an odd-sized matrix, the next element (the start of the second half) would be directly above the middle element at the bottom. In the case of an even-sized matrix, the next element would be directly to the left of the middle element.

3. We don't need to iterate through the matrix to find these elements; we can determine their positions directly from the value of $n$.

Now, let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
def find_positions(n):
    # If n is odd, the bottom middle element is the largest in the first half
    # and the one above it is the smallest in the second half
    if n % 2 == 1:
        pos_first = (n, n // 2 + 1)  # Bottom middle element
        pos_second = (n - 1, n // 2 + 1)  # One above the bottom middle element
    # If n is even, the middle right element is the largest in the first half
    # and the one to its left is the smallest in the second half
    else:
        pos_first = (n // 2, n // 2 + 1)  # Middle right element
        pos_second = (n // 2, n // 2)  # Middle left element
    return pos_first, pos_second

# Read the input file
with open('spiralmatrix.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the positions
pos_first, pos_second = find_positions(n)

# Write the output file
with open('spiralmatrix.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{pos_first[0]} {pos_first[1]}\n')
    file.write(f'{pos_second[0]} {pos_second[1]}\n')
```

This implementation is based on an analysis of the spiral pattern, which allows us to pinpoint the positions directly for both odd and even $n$. The code should now output the expected results for the given input data.
