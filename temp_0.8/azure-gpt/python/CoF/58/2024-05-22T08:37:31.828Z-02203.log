În faţa palatului Prinţesei Mofturoase se află $N$ peţitori aşezaţi la coadă, unul în spatele celuilalt. Fiecare poartă sub mantie un număr de pietre preţioase pe care doreşte să le ofere prinţesei ca dar de nuntă. Pentru a nu semăna vrajbă în rândurile lor, prinţesa a decis să-i determine ca $N-1$ dintre ei să renunţe în chip paşnic, peţitorul rămas devenind alesul prinţesei (indiferent de numărul de pietre preţioase deţinute de acesta).

Doi peţitori vecini la coadă se pot înţelege între ei astfel: cel care are mai puţine pietre preţioase pleacă de la coadă primind de la celălalt un număr de pietre astfel încât să plece acasă cu un număr dublu de pietre faţă de câte avea. Dacă doi peţitori au acelaşi număr de pietre, unul din ei (nu contează care) pleacă luând toate pietrele vecinului său. 

Un peţitor se poate înţelege la un moment dat cu unul singur dintre cei doi vecini ai săi. După plecarea unui peţitor, toţi cei din spatele lui avansează.

De exemplu: pentru configuraţia alăturată de $5$ peţitori, un şir posibil de negocieri care conduc la reducerea cozii la un singur peţitor este: se înţeleg vecinii $4$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $4$, se înţeleg apoi $1$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $1$, se înţeleg apoi $3$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $3$, se înţeleg $2$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $5$. Astfel peţitorul $2$ câştigă mâna preafrumoasei prinţese, oferindu-i $0$ pietre preţioase ca dar de nuntă.

                    temp[i] = temp[i] * 2
                else:
                    temp[i + 1] = temp[i + 1] * 2
                del temp[i + 1]

    fout.write(f"{len(unique_final_values)}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, unique_final_values)) + '\n')
```

This code reads the list of petitioners from `nunta.in`, calculates all possible outcomes of negotiations using recursion, and writes the sorted list of unique final values to `nunta.out`. The solution eliminates duplicate gem counts at the start for efficiency and uses recursion to calculate all negotiation outcomes.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected result and the found output and checking the algorithm, it's clear that the implementation is not correctly simulating the negotiations as described in the problem statement. The mistake lies in the way the negotiations are handled when petitioners have different amounts of gems.

The negotiation logic should be as follows: When two petitioners negotiate, the one with fewer gems receives enough gems from the other so that they leave the queue with double what they initially had. However, the current implementation simply doubles the gems without correctly simulating the exchange between the petitioners.

Let's correct the implementation to properly handle the negotiations:

```python
def get_unique_final_values(n, gems):
    # Initialize a set to hold unique final values
    final_values = set()

    # Recursive function to find all possible outcomes of negotiations
    def negotiate(remaining):
        # Base case: if there's only one petitioner left, add its gem count to the final values
        if len(remaining) == 1:
            final_values.add(remaining[0])
            return

        for i in range(len(remaining) - 1):
            # Copy the list to simulate the negotiation between two petitioners
            new_remaining = remaining.copy()

            if new_remaining[i] == new_remaining[i + 1]:
                # If they have the same amount of gems, one petitioner leaves with all the gems.
                new_remaining.pop(i)
            else:
                # The one with fewer gems takes enough to double their amount and leaves.
                if new_remaining[i] < new_remaining[i + 1]:
                    new_remaining[i + 1] -= new_remaining[i]
                    new_remaining[i] *= 2
                else:
                    new_remaining[i] -= new_remaining[i + 1]
                    new_remaining[i + 1] *= 2
                new_remaining.pop(i + 1)

            # Recursively process the remaining petitioners
            negotiate(new_remaining)

    # Start the recursive negotiation from the initial list of gems
    negotiate(gems)

    # Return the sorted list of unique final values
    return sorted(final_values)

# Read from the input file
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    gems = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Get the unique final values
unique_final_values = get_unique_final_values(n, gems)

# Write to the output file
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{len(unique_final_values)}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, unique_final_values)) + '\n')
```

In this fixed version of the algorithm, when two petitioners with different numbers of gems negotiate, the one with fewer gems takes enough from the other to double their amount, and then they leave. This change should produce the correct sequence of negotiations and ultimately the correct set of unique final values.

Upon reviewing the code and the expected versus actual output, it is clear that the negotiation logic is still flawed. The original recursive approach did not consider all possible negotiation sequences, as some petitioners may negotiate multiple times before leaving.

Let's fix the logic. We will need to simulate each possible negotiation between neighbors and keep track of all unique gem totals for the final petitioner. Since the order of negotiations can affect the outcome, we must consider each petitioner as a possible starting point for negotiations and simulate every possible sequence.

Here is the revised and correct implementation:

```python
def negotiate(peers, index, gems):
    # When only one petitioner remains, add their gems to the possible outcomes
    if len(peers) == 1:
        gems.add(peers[0])
        return

    # Ensure we do not go out of bounds
    if index < 0 or index >= len(peers) - 1:
        return

    # Copy the list to avoid modifying the original during recursion
    next_peers = peers[:]

    # If both petitioners have the same number of gems, remove one
    if next_peers[index] == next_peers[index + 1]:
        next_peers.pop(index)
        negotiate(next_peers, index - 1, gems)  # Continue with previous pair
        negotiate(next_peers, index, gems)  # Continue with next pair
    else:
        # Transfer gems from the petitioner with more to the one with fewer
        if next_peers[index] > next_peers[index + 1]:
            winner, loser = index, index + 1
        else:
            winner, loser = index + 1, index

        # Double the gems of the petitioner with fewer gems
        next_peers[loser] *= 2
        next_peers[winner] -= next_peers[loser]

        # Remove the petitioner who now has doubled their gems and leaves
        next_peers.pop(loser)
        
        # Recursively continue negotiation with the remaining petitioners
        negotiate(next_peers, loser - 1, gems)  # Continue with previous pair
        negotiate(next_peers, loser, gems)  # Continue with next pair

# Read the input data from 'nunta.in'
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitioners = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Set to store all the unique final amounts of gems
unique_gems = set()

# Start the negotiation process from each possible index
for i in range(n - 1):
    negotiate(petitioners, i, unique_gems)

# Write the output data to 'nunta.out'
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(unique_gems)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(unique_gems))) + '\n')
```

This new implementation considers all possible negotiation sequences by recursively negotiating with each pair of neighbors and proceeding with all possible negotiation paths from there. When a petitioner leaves, the recursion continues with both adjacent pairs, ensuring all sequences are explored. After completing all negotiations, the set `unique_gems` will contain all possible final gem totals, which are then written to 'nunta.out'. This corrected version should give the expected result.

The expected output indicates that we need to consider all possible sequences of negotiations, where each negotiation can involve either of the two neighbors of a petitioner. The algorithm still seems to be failing to consider all possible sequences of negotiations.

A key observation to solving this problem is that, when two petitioners negotiate, the one with more gems always gives up enough gems so that the other petitioner ends up with double their original number. However, the previous implementation assumes the negotiation always happens from left to right in sequential order, which is not the case. We should consider each petitioner as a possible starting point for negotiations and simulate all possible sequences of negotiation, ensuring that we check both directions of negotiation.

Let's rewrite the entire solution using a new approach that considers all possible sequences of negotiations. We will simulate each negotiation step and recursively try all possible negotiation pairs:

```python
# Read the input data from 'nunta.in'
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitioners = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Function to perform negotiations recursively
def negotiate(petitioners):
    if len(petitioners) == 1:
        return {petitioners[0]}
    outcomes = set()
    for i in range(len(petitioners) - 1):
        if petitioners[i] < petitioners[i + 1]:
            new_petitioners = petitioners[:i] + [petitioners[i] * 2] + petitioners[i + 2:]
            outcomes.update(negotiate(new_petitioners))
        elif petitioners[i] > petitioners[i + 1]:
            new_petitioners = petitioners[:i + 1] + [petitioners[i + 1] * 2] + petitioners[i + 2:]
            outcomes.update(negotiate(new_petitioners))
        else:
            # If they have the same amount, any of them can leave
            new_petitioners_same_left = petitioners[:i] + petitioners[i + 1:]
            new_petitioners_same_right = petitioners[:i + 1] + petitioners[i + 2:]
            outcomes.update(negotiate(new_petitioners_same_left))
            outcomes.update(negotiate(new_petitioners_same_right))
    return outcomes

# Get all unique outcomes
unique_outcomes = sorted(list(negotiate(petitioners)))

# Write the output data to 'nunta.out'
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(unique_outcomes)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, unique_outcomes)) + '\n')
```

This approach ensures that all possible pairs of neighbors are considered for negotiation at each step. When two petitioners have the same number of gems, we simulate both possibilities (either could leave), and we continue with the rest of the petitioners. This should provide us with all unique outcomes. We then write these unique outcomes, sorted, to the output file `nunta.out`.

The discrepancies between the expected and the found results are due to incorrect handling of the negotiations between the petitioners. The negotiation process must ensure that when a petitioner with fewer gems negotiates, they take gems from the one with more gems so they end up with double their original amount and leave.

The main issue here is the negotiation logic. Let's clarify the rules:

1. If two petitioners have the same amount of gems, either can leave, but not both. The other petitioner stays without changing their gem count.
2. If two petitioners have different amounts of gems, the one with fewer gems takes enough from the one with more gems to double their amount and leaves. The one with more gems loses the exact amount that the other one doubled.

The following solution corrects the logic and considers all possible negotiation sequences:

```python
def negotiate(petitioners):
    # Base case: one petitioner remains.
    if len(petitioners) == 1:
        return {petitioners[0]}
        
    outcomes = set()

    for i in range(len(petitioners) - 1):
        if petitioners[i] < petitioners[i + 1]:
            # The left petitioner has fewer gems; they double their gems and leave.
            new_petitioners = petitioners[:i] + [petitioners[i + 1] - petitioners[i]] + petitioners[i + 2:]
            outcomes |= negotiate(new_petitioners)
        elif petitioners[i] > petitioners[i + 1]:
            # The right petitioner has fewer gems; they double their gems and leave.
            new_petitioners = petitioners[:i] + [petitioners[i] - petitioners[i + 1]] + petitioners[i + 2:]
            outcomes |= negotiate(new_petitioners)
        else:
            # Both have the same number of gems; try both possibilities, one leaving at a time.
            new_petitioners_same_left = petitioners[:i] + petitioners[i + 1:]
            new_petitioners_same_right = petitioners[:i + 1] + petitioners[i + 2:]
            outcomes |= negotiate(new_petitioners_same_left)
            outcomes |= negotiate(new_petitioners_same_right)
            
    return outcomes

# Read the input data from 'nunta.in'
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitioners = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Get all unique outcomes
unique_outcomes = sorted(negotiate(petitioners))

# Write the output data to 'nunta.out'
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(unique_outcomes)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, unique_outcomes)) + '\n')
```

In this corrected solution, when negotiating, we make sure to subtract the doubled amount of gems from the petitioner with more gems. This should cover all possible negotiation sequences and yield the correct set of unique final values. The set `outcomes` collects all unique final gem counts, which are then sorted and written to `nunta.out`. This should produce the expected output.
