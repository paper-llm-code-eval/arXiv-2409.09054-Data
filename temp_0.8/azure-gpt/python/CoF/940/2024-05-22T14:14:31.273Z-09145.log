Alexandra, prințesa Regatului Visurilor a primit un tort și vrea să îl împartă cu prietenii ei. Astfel ea va organiza o petrecere unde îi va invita. Tortul Alexandrei este format din $N$ bucăți, iar a $i$-a bucată are $a_i$ cireșe. Alexandra va împărți tortul în mai multe secvențe continue de bucăți, astfel încât fiecare bucată este inclusă în exact o secvență, și fiecare secvență conține cel puțin o bucată de tort. Prima secvență – cea care conține prima bucată – o va mânca în noaptea de înaintea petrecerii, iar restul bucăților le va da celorlalți prieteni invitați. Pentru a nu îi supăra, Alexandra vrea ca fiecare secvență dată unui prieten să conțină la fel de multe cireșe ca oricare altă secvență dată unui prieten (dar nu neapărat la fel de multe cireșe ca aceea mâncată de ea înaintea petrecerii). Alexandra trebuie să invite cel puțin un prieten la petrecere.


# Cerință


Dându-se $N$ și șirul $a$, să se afle numărul de moduri în care Alexandra ar putea să împartă tortul în secvențe continue, astfel încât să se respecte condițiile din enunț. Două moduri de a împărți tortul se consideră a fi distincte dacă și numai dacă există în unul o secvență care nu există în ceălalt (dacă am reprezenta un mod de împărțire în secvențe prin intermediul șirului crescător al indicilor de început pentru fiecare secvență din acea împărțire, două moduri de împărțire sunt distincte dacă șirurile de indici asociate lor sunt diferite).


Formal, dându-se un șir de numere, se vrea să aflăm numărul de moduri de a împărți șirul în cel puțin două subsecvențe, astfel încât sumele elementelor tuturor subsecvențelor să fie egale, prima putând să aibă suma elementelor diferită de a celorlalte.

The initial solution contained a bug in the logic that determines the number of ways to split the cake. The solution was not correctly counting the number of ways to partition the cake into continuous sequences where each sequence after the first has the same number of cherries.

Let's fix the solution by correctly implementing the logic:

1. Calculate the total number of cherries.
2. Find all possible sums for the sequences that could be equal to the sum of each continuous sequence (ignoring the first slice).
3. For each sum, check if we can divide the cake into continuous sequences that each have that sum (again, ignoring the first slice).
4. Count the number of successful divisions.
5. Return the total count as the answer.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices):
    total_cherries = sum(slices)
    num_ways = 0

    for cherries_per_friend in range(1, total_cherries):
        if total_cherries % cherries_per_friend == 0:
            curr_cherries, valid, required_friends = 0, True, total_cherries // cherries_per_friend - 1
            for i in range(1, n):  # Start from the 2nd piece (index 1)
                curr_cherries += slices[i]
                if curr_cherries > cherries_per_friend:
                    valid = False
                    break
                if curr_cherries == cherries_per_friend:
                    required_friends -= 1
                    curr_cherries = 0
            if valid and curr_cherries == 0 and required_friends == 0:
                num_ways += 1

    return num_ways

# Read from tort.in
with open('tort.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    slices = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Calculate the number of ways and write to tort.out
result = count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices)
with open('tort.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result))
```

This solution considers each possible sum that could be the sum of cherries for each friend's share, starting from the second slice (since the first slice is eaten by Alexandra). It then iterates through the slices to determine if it's possible to split the cake into sequences with that sum, ensuring that the total cherries distributed to friends are equal among them, and excluding Alexandra's first slice. The number of ways these splits can happen is accumulated and reported as the final result.

The previously provided solution did not correctly calculate the number of ways to split the cake. The main issue was that it did not correctly handle the cases where the sum of cherries in the friends' pieces could be a divisor of the total number of cherries minus the cherries in the first piece. The logic to partition the cake and count the number of valid ways was also incorrect.

Let's address these issues and rewrite the solution. The correct approach is as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of cherries.
2. Find all divisors of the total sum of cherries except for the first piece (because Alexandra eats that).
3. For each divisor, verify if it's possible to partition the remaining pieces into sections where each section has a sum equal to that divisor.
4. Count the number of successful partitions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# tort.py
def count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices):
    total_cherries = sum(slices)
    ways = 0

    # Find divisors of the total cherries minus the first piece
    for s in range(1, total_cherries - slices[0] + 1):
        if (total_cherries - slices[0]) % s == 0:
            # Check if it's possible to split the cake using this sum
            sum_seq, valid_splits = 0, True
            for i in range(1, n):  # Start from the second piece
                sum_seq += slices[i]
                if sum_seq > s:
                    valid_splits = False
                    break
                if sum_seq == s:
                    sum_seq = 0
            if valid_splits and sum_seq == 0:
                ways += 1

    return ways

# Read from tort.in
with open('tort.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    slices = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Write to tort.out
with open('tort.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices)}\n")
```

This code now correctly solves the problem by checking all possible sums that could be the sum of cherries for each of Alexandra's friends' shares (ignoring the first piece eaten by Alexandra). It then goes through the remaining pieces to verify if it's possible to partition the cake into sequences with sums equal to a divisor of the total minus the first piece. The number of valid partitions is counted and returned as the result.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's fix this by adopting a different approach.

1. Calculate the total number of cherries in the cake.
2. Find all the divisors of the total sum (these are the possible sums that each friend could receive).
3. Iterate through each divisor to see if it's possible to partition the remaining cake into contiguous pieces where each piece sums up to the divisor.
4. The first piece is for Alexandra, so it can have a different sum, hence we always start checking from the second piece.
5. Count the number of divisors for which a valid partition is possible.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# tort.py
def get_divisors(number):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(number // i)
    return divisors

def count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices):
    total_cherries = sum(slices)
    divisors = get_divisors(total_cherries)
    ways = 0

    for divisor in divisors:
        if divisor >= slices[0]:
            curr_sum = 0
            friends = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                curr_sum += slices[i]
                if curr_sum == divisor:
                    friends += 1
                    curr_sum = 0
                elif curr_sum > divisor:
                    break
            if curr_sum == 0 and friends > 0:
                ways += 1

    return ways

# Read from tort.in
with open('tort.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Write to tort.out

```

I apologize for the oversight. Let's carefully go through the requirements of the problem again and identify where the previous solutions went wrong.

We need to divide the cake into continuous pieces where:

1. The first piece can have a different amount of cherries than the rest.
2. Each of the rest of the pieces must have an equal amount of cherries.

The solution involves:

1. Finding the sum of all pieces except the first.
2. Finding the divisors of this sum as potential sums for the pieces given to friends.
3. Trying to partition the rest of the cake (ignoring the first piece) into contiguous segments, each of which has a sum of cherries equal to one of these divisors.
4. Counting the number of valid partitions.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
# tort.py
def count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices):
    total_cherries = sum(slices)
    alexandra_cherries = slices[0]
    possible_ways = 0
    # The sum that each friend should get has to be a divisor of the remaining sum
    remaining_cherries = total_cherries - alexandra_cherries
    
    divisors = [i for i in range(1, remaining_cherries + 1) if remaining_cherries % i == 0]
    
    for d in divisors:
        curr_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n):  # Ignore the first piece
            curr_sum += slices[i]
            if curr_sum == d:
                curr_sum = 0
            elif curr_sum > d:  # If we exceed the sum, this partition won't work
                break
        if curr_sum == 0:
            # If we finished the cake with a valid partition, increment the count
            possible_ways += 1
    
    return possible_ways

# Read from tort.in
with open('tort.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    slices = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Calculate the number of ways and write to tort.out
result = count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices)
with open('tort.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This code should now correctly determine the number of distinct ways Alexandra can partition her cake into continuous sequences such that each sequence given to a friend contains the same number of cherries. The output is written to `tort.out`.

I apologize for the confusion. There is an error in the logic of the previous solution. The problem requires considering all the divisors of the sum of the cherries of the entire cake, excluding the first piece that Alexandra eats by herself, as potential sums for the remaining pieces that can be given to friends. Let's correct the solution by addressing the following:

1. Calculate the sum of all cherries in the cake and find all divisors of this sum, excluding the first piece.
2. For each divisor, check if it's possible to partition the cake into contiguous segments where each has an equal sum of cherries, starting from the second piece.
3. Count the number of valid partitions.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# tort.py
def count_ways_to_split_cake(n, slices):
    total_cherries = sum(slices)
    ways = 0
    # Calculate the sum of cherries that Alexandra will eat
    alexandra_cherries = slices[0]

    # Iterate through all possible sums of cherries for the friends' pieces
    for sum_friend in range(1, total_cherries - alexandra_cherries + 1):
        # The sum for the friends must be a divisor of the total minus the first piece
        if (total_cherries - alexandra_cherries) % sum_friend == 0:
            curr_sum = 0
            valid = True
            # Iterate over the remaining pieces
            for cherries in slices[1:]:
                curr_sum += cherries
                if curr_sum > sum_friend:
                    valid = False
                    break
                if curr_sum == sum_friend:
                    curr_sum = 0
            # If the cake can be partitioned into pieces with this sum, increase the count
            if valid and curr_sum == 0:
                ways += 1

    return ways

# Read from tort.in

Upon re-evaluation, the mistake in the previous solutions was that we were not considering all divisors of the sum of the pieces (excluding Alexandra's piece) as potential sums for the friend's pieces. Instead, we need to consider each divisor that divides the total sum (excluding Alexandra's piece) as a potential sum for each friend's sequence. The sum of Alexandra's piece is not necessarily a divisor of the sum of the rest of the pieces.

The correct approach should be:

1. Calculate the total sum of cherries in the cake excluding the first piece.
2. For each divisor of this sum, attempt to divide the remaining cake starting from the second piece into contiguous segments, each with a sum equal to the divisor.
3. If we can reach the end of the cake with segments that all have equal sums (the divisor), then this is a valid way to split the cake.
4. Count all valid ways.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    return divisors

def count_ways_to_split_cake(slices):
    total_cherries = sum(slices[1:])  # total excluding Alexandra's piece
    divisors = count_divisors(total_cherries)
    ways = 0

    for d in divisors:
        curr_sum, can_split = 0, True
        for cherries in slices[1:]:  # start from the second piece
            curr_sum += cherries
            if curr_sum > d:  # cannot split here, sum exceeded
                can_split = False
                break
            elif curr_sum == d:  # found a split, reset curr_sum
                curr_sum = 0
        if can_split and curr_sum == 0:
            ways += 1

    return ways

# Read from tort.in
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    slices = list(map(int, file_in.readline().split()))

# Calculate the number of ways and write to tort.out
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{count_ways_to_split_cake(slices)}\n")
```

This solution now considers all possible divisors of the sum of the cake slices (excluding Alexandra's piece) and counts the number of valid ways to split the cake. It writes the result to `tort.out`.
