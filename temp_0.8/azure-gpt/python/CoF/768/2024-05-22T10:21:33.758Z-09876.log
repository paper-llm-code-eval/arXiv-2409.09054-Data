Parcul oraşului a fost neglijat mult timp, astfel că acum toate aleile sunt distruse. Prin urmare, anul acesta Primăria şi-a propus să facă reamenajări. 

Parcul are forma unui pătrat cu latura de $n$ metri şi este înconjurat de un gard care are exact două porţi. Proiectanţii de la Primărie au realizat o hartă a parcului şi au trasat pe hartă un caroiaj care împarte parcul în $n \times n$ zone pătrate cu latura de $1$ metru. Astfel harta parcului are aspectul unei matrice pătratice cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane. Liniile şi respectiv coloanele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$. Elementele matricei corespund zonelor pătrate de latură $1$ metru. O astfel de zonă poate să conţină un copac sau este liberă.

Edilii oraşului doresc să paveze cu un număr minim de dale pătrate cu latura de $1$ metru zonele libere (fără copaci) ale parcului, astfel încât să se obţină o alee continuă de la o poartă la alta.

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine numărul minim de dale necesare pentru construirea unei alei continue de la o poartă la cealaltă.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `alee.in` conţine pe prima linie două valori naturale $n$ şi $m$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând dimensiunea parcului, respectiv numărul de copaci care se găsesc în parc. Fiecare dintre următoarele $m$ linii conţine câte două numere naturale $x$ şi $y$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând poziţiile copacilor în parc ($x$ reprezintă linia, iar $y$ reprezintă coloana zonei în care se află copacul). Ultima linie a fişierului conţine patru numere naturale $x_1 \ y_1 \ x_2 \ y_2$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând poziţiile celor două porţi ($x_1$, $y_1$ reprezintă linia şi respectiv coloana zonei ce conţine prima poartă, iar $x_2$, $y_2$ reprezintă linia şi respectiv coloana zonei ce  conţine cea de a doua poartă). 

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `alee.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural care reprezintă numărul minim de dale necesare pentru construirea aleii. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 175$
* $1 \leq m < n \cdot n$
*	Aleea este continuă dacă oricare două plăci consecutive au o latură comună.
*	Aleea începe cu zona unde se găseşte prima poartă şi se termină cu zona unde se găseşte cea de a doua poartă. 
*	Poziţiile porţilor sunt distincte şi corespund unor zone libere.
*	Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie.

    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we have reached the end
        if (x, y) == end:
            return dist
        
        # Explore all valid moves
        for dx, dy in directions:
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            if is_valid_move(new_x, new_y, grid, n):
                grid[new_x][new_y] = 1  # Mark as visited
                queue.append((new_x, new_y, dist + 1))

    return -1

# Read input data

# Write output data
with open('alee.out', 'w') as file:

```

This solution reads the input from `alee.in`, determines the minimum number of tiles needed to build the alley by performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the grid, and writes the output to `alee.out`. The BFS guarantees the shortest path from the start to the end if one exists, counting the number of steps (tiles) required. The grid is marked with `-1` for trees and `1` for visited tiles.

The error is due to the fact that the `queue` is expecting tuples of length 3, but when adding the start position to the queue, we are giving it an additional value (distance) which is not initially present in the `start` tuple. Since `start` and `end` are read from the file as tuples of length 2, we need to construct a tuple of length 3 (by adding distance) while enqueuing the start position. I will correct this mistake and provide the fixed solution below:

```python
from collections import deque

# Function to check if a move is inside the grid and not a tree
def is_valid_move(x, y, grid, n):
    return 0 < x <= n and 0 < y <= n and grid[x][y] == 0

# Function to find the minimum number of tiles needed to build the alley
def min_tiles_to_build_alley(n, m, trees, start, end):
    # Directions for a move (up, down, left, right)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    grid = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for tree in trees:
        grid[tree[0]][tree[1]] = -1  # Marking the tree positions
    
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])  # (x, y, distance)
    grid[start[0]][start[1]] = 1  # Mark the start position
    
    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we have reached the end
        if (x, y) == end:
            return dist
        
        # Explore all valid moves
        for dx, dy in directions:
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            if is_valid_move(new_x, new_y, grid, n):
                grid[new_x][new_y] = 1  # Mark as visited
                queue.append((new_x, new_y, dist + 1))
    
    # If the loop ends without reaching the end, there's no path
    return -1

# Read input data
with open('alee.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    trees = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    start = tuple(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    end = tuple(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Get the result
tiles_needed = min_tiles_to_build_alley(n, m, trees, start, end)

# Write output data
with open('alee.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{tiles_needed}\n')
```

This corrected solution reads the input from `alee.in`, computes the minimum number of tiles needed to build the alley using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, and writes the result to `alee.out`. The code ensures that tuples in the queue have a length of 3, and it correctly constructs the start tuple with an initial distance of `0`.

The issue seems to be that the grid is initialized with all zeros, which would imply that all the places are available for placing tiles. However, the BFS algorithm also uses a value of `0` to check if a cell is unvisited, which is leading to confusion with trees and unvisited cells. We need to distinguish between unvisited cells and tree cells properly.

I will fix the issue by initializing the grid with an appropriate value (e.g., `-1` for trees, `0` for unvisited cells, and `1` for visited cells). Also, ensure that the BFS algorithm checks for cells with a value of `0` (unvisited cells) when exploring new positions.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

# Function to check if a move is inside the grid and not a tree or visited
def is_valid_move(x, y, grid, n):
    return 0 < x <= n and 0 < y <= n and grid[x][y] == 0

# Function to find the minimum number of tiles needed to build the alley
def min_tiles_to_build_alley(n, m, trees, start, end):
    # Directions for a move (up, down, left, right)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    grid = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Marking the tree positions on the grid
    for tree in trees:
        grid[tree[0]][tree[1]] = -1
    
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 1)])  # (x, y, distance)
    
    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we have reached the end
        if (x, y) == end:
            return dist - 1  # Subtract one to exclude the starting tile
        
        # Explore all valid moves
        for dx, dy in directions:
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            if is_valid_move(new_x, new_y, grid, n):
                grid[new_x][new_y] = 1  # Mark as visited
                queue.append((new_x, new_y, dist + 1))
    
    # If the loop ends without reaching the end, there's no path
    return -1

# Read input data
with open('alee.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    trees = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    start = tuple(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    end = tuple(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Get the result
tiles_needed = min_tiles_to_build_alley(n, m, trees, start, end)

# Write output data
with open('alee.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{tiles_needed}\n')
```

This solution initializes the grid by setting tree positions to `-1`. The BFS algorithm only considers cells with a value of `0` as valid moves, meaning those cells are unvisited and do not contain trees. When the algorithm reaches the end position, it returns the distance minus one because the starting tile is not counted as one that needs to be paved. The result is written to `alee.out`.

After reviewing the previous solution and the given error, it seems that the updated BFS algorithm still could not find a path from the start to the end, which is why it returned `-1`. This is unusual because we've expected that there is always a solution as per the problem statement.

Let's diagnose potential issues:

1. The grid might not be initialized properly after marking the trees. We should verify that the grid setup is correct and that the BFS algorithm is exploring the correct cells.
2. The BFS algorithm itself might not be implemented correctly. We need to check the boundary conditions and ensure we're not revisiting cells that have already been visited.

A potential mistake in the given solution is not marking the starting point as visited. This could create an infinite loop if the starting point is enqueued again.

Here's another attempt with the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

# Function to check if a move is inside the grid and not a tree or visited
def is_valid_move(x, y, grid, n):
    return 0 < x <= n and 0 < y <= n and grid[x][y] == 0

# Function to find the minimum number of tiles needed to build the alley
def min_tiles_to_build_alley(n, trees, start, end):
    # Directions for a move (up, down, left, right)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    grid = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Marking the tree positions on the grid
    for tree in trees:
        grid[tree[0]][tree[1]] = -1
    
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])  # (x, y, distance)
    grid[start[0]][start[1]] = 1  # Mark the start position as visited
    
    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we have reached the end
        if (x, y) == end:
            return dist
        
        # Explore all valid moves
        for dx, dy in directions:
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            if is_valid_move(new_x, new_y, grid, n):
                grid[new_x][new_y] = 1  # Mark as visited
                queue.append((new_x, new_y, dist + 1))
    
    # If the loop ends without reaching the end, there's no path
    return -1

# Read input data
with open('alee.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    trees = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    start = tuple(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    end = tuple(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Get the result
tiles_needed = min_tiles_to_build_alley(n, trees, start, end)

# Write output data
with open('alee.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{tiles_needed}\n')
```

In this solution, I made sure to mark the starting position as visited before starting the BFS search. Now, the BFS should correctly process the grid without getting stuck in an infinite loop or missing the correct path. This should ensure the code returns the correct minimum number of tiles required to build the alley, as expected.

It appears that there is a bug in the BFS implementation. It's possible that the algorithm is not correctly processing the grid or the tree positions are not correctly marked. Let's review the logic and update the solution accordingly.

We need to ensure the BFS algorithm does the following:

1. Marks the positions of trees correctly and does not allow moves to those positions.
2. Starts the BFS from the first gate and only considers cells within the grid bounds and those that are not trees.
3. Updates the distance correctly and stops as soon as it reaches the second gate.
4. Properly returns the minimum number of moves required to get from the first gate to the second gate.

BFS should be the right algorithm for this task, so let's try to identify and fix any issues in the previous code:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_shortest_path(grid, start, end):
    queue = deque([start])
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, down, left, up
    while queue:
        x, y, steps = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == end:
            return steps
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 < nx <= len(grid) - 1 and 0 < ny <= len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                grid[nx][ny] = steps + 1  # Mark the cell with the number of steps
                queue.append((nx, ny, steps + 1))
    return -1  # If no path is found

# Read input data
with open('alee.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]  # Initialize grid with 0
    for _ in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid[x][y] = -1  # Mark trees with -1
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Run BFS to find the shortest path
min_steps = bfs_shortest_path(grid, (x1, y1, 0), (x2, y2))

# Write output data
with open('alee.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_steps) + '\n')
```

This solution does the following:

1. Initializes the grid with `0` to represent open spaces and `-1` for tree locations.
2. Starts the BFS search from the first gate position with an initial step count of `0`.
3. Explores each direction only if the cell is within the bounds and is not a tree (`grid[nx][ny] == 0`).
4. Marks cells with the number of steps taken to get there, ensuring it only visits each cell once.
5. Returns the number of steps as soon as it reaches the second gate.

This code should adhere to the problem constraints and find the minimum path successfully. We are now checking for valid moves with the right grid values and correctly initializing the grid.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found output indicates an off-by-one error in counting the number of steps in the BFS algorithm. This can happen if the starting point is not being counted as a step when it should be. To correct this, we must ensure that the initial step count is set to 1 when we start from the first gate, as we have to count the starting tile as well.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_shortest_path(grid, start, end, n):
    # Directions for a move (right, down, left, up)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 1)])  # Start with a step count of 1
    grid[start[0]][start[1]] = 1  # Mark the starting cell as visited

    while queue:
        x, y, steps = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == end:
            return steps
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 1 <= nx <= n and 1 <= ny <= n and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                grid[nx][ny] = steps + 1  # Mark the cell with the number of steps
                queue.append((nx, ny, steps + 1))
    return -1  # If no path is found

# Read input data
with open('alee.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]  # Initialize grid with 0
    for _ in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid[x][y] = -1  # Mark trees with -1
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Run BFS to find the shortest path
min_steps = bfs_shortest_path(grid, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), n)

# Write output data
with open('alee.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_steps) + '\n')
```

The BFS algorithm is initialized with a step count of 1 to account for the starting tile. This should ensure that the number of steps returned by the `bfs_shortest_path` function matches the expected minimum number of tiles needed to build the alley. The solution now correctly writes this number to the `alee.out` file.
