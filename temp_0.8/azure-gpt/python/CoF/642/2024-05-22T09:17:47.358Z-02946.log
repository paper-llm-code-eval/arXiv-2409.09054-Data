Definim un număr ***liber de pătrate*** ca fiind un număr natural care nu are ca divizor niciun pătrat perfect mai mare ca $1$. Prin convenție, $1$ este considerat *liber de pătrate*.

Așadar, șirul numerelor *libere de pătrate* este: $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, \dots$

Se consideră un șir de $N$ numere naturale $X_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, unde $N$ este un număr natural.

Definim o ***bisecvență*** ca un subșir nevid obținut prin eliminarea dintr-o secvență a unui număr care nu este la începutul sau la sfârșitul secvenței.

# Cerințe
1) Să se determine câte numere *libere de pătrate* conține șirul dat.
2) Să se determine cea mai lungă *bisecvență* din șir formată din numere *libere de pătrate*, obținută prin eliminarea unui număr care **nu** este *liber de pătrate*.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `oneout.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$, reprezentând cerința, pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$ iar pe a treia linie $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, în fișierul de ieșire `oneout.out` se va scrie numărul de numere *libere de pătrate* din șir.

Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$:
- Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `oneout.out` se vor scrie două numere $L$ și $K$ despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $L$ reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *bisecvențe* cu proprietățile cerute, iar $K$ reprezintă numărul de *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă existente în șir.
- Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor scrie indicii de început și de sfârșit ai fiecărei *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă găsite, în ordinea crescătoare a indicelui de start, despărțite printr-un spațiu.
- Dacă șirul nu conține nicio *bisecvență* cu proprietățile cerute, în fișierul de ieșire se va scrie `-1`.

# Restricții și precizări
- $3 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $2 \leq X_i \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Lungimea unei *bisecvențe* reprezintă numărul de numere din aceasta.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 37 de puncte $C = 1$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 24 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 25$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 63 de puncte $C = 2$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 23 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 101$.

Upon examining the original solution, I see that the methodology for computing the longest bisubsequence was flawed. The original solution did not correctly handle the situation where non-square-free numbers had to be skipped and only one such number should be removed to form the bisubsequence. Also, it did not correctly compute the start and end indices of the bisubsequences.

I will now provide a corrected solution that will correctly identify the longest bisubsequence by only considering sequences where exactly one non-square-free number has been removed, and that number was not at the start or end of the sequence. The indices will be adjusted accordingly to match the problem description.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import math

# Check if a number is square-free (liber de pătrate)
def is_square_free(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            n //= i
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
    return True

# Function to solve the challenge based on the problem statement
def solve_challenge(task, numbers):
    square_free_count = 0
    square_free_indices = []

    # Count square-free numbers and keep track of their indices
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        if is_square_free(num):
            square_free_count += 1
            square_free_indices.append(i)

    if task == 1:
        return str(square_free_count)

    elif task == 2:
        max_len = 0
        max_count = 0
        longest_sequences = []

        # Find the longest bisubsequences
        for start in range(len(square_free_indices)):
            for end in range(start + 1, len(square_free_indices)):
                # Calculate the length of the current sequence
                length = square_free_indices[end] - square_free_indices[start] - 1
                if length > max_len:
                    max_len = length
                    max_count = 1
                    longest_sequences = [(square_free_indices[start] + 1, square_free_indices[end])]
                elif length == max_len:
                    max_count += 1
                    longest_sequences.append((square_free_indices[start] + 1, square_free_indices[end]))

        if max_len == 0:
            return "-1"

        result = f"{max_len} {max_count}\n"
        result += "\n".join(f"{start} {end}" for start, end in longest_sequences)
        return result

# Read input data
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process data based on the problem requirement and write to output file
with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
    result = solve_challenge(c, arr)
    file.write(result)
```

This solution should work correctly for the provided test case and other cases as well. It reads the input from `oneout.in`, processes the data to find the square-free numbers and the longest bisubsequence, and writes the result to `oneout.out`.

The previous solution still has a bug: it incorrectly calculates the length of each sequence because it is counting all the numbers between the starting and ending indices of square-free numbers, including the non-square-free number itself. However, according to the problem statement, we should only consider the longest bisubsequence formed by removing one non-square-free number from the sequence. We should also ensure that the number removed is not the first or last number in the sequence.

The expected output indicates that the longest bisubsequence has a length of 3, and it starts at index 1 and ends at index 4. The numbers at these indices are square-free, but the number at index 3 (12) is not square-free and is being removed to form the bisubsequence.

The solution needs to properly iterate through the array and check for continuous sequences of square-free numbers, keeping track of the longest one found so far. If a non-square-free number is encountered, it should check whether removing that number forms a longer bisubsequence.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
import math

# Efficient function to check if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(n):
    for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (p * p) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to process the challenge based on the task required
def process_challenge(task, numbers):
    if task == 1:
        # Task 1: Count square-free numbers
        return str(sum(is_square_free(num) for num in numbers))

    elif task == 2:
        # Task 2: Find the longest bisubsequence of square-free numbers
        longest = 0
        longest_indices = []
        current_start = None
        num_bisequences = 0

        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            if is_square_free(numbers[i]):
                if current_start is None:
                    current_start = i
            else:
                if current_start is not None:
                    length = i - current_start
                    if length > longest:
                        longest = length
                        longest_indices = [(current_start, i)]
                        num_bisequences = 1
                    elif length == longest:
                        longest_indices.append((current_start, i))
                        num_bisequences += 1
                current_start = None

        # Check for the case when the array ends with a square-free number
        if current_start is not None:
            length = len(numbers) - current_start
            if length > longest:
                longest = length
                longest_indices = [(current_start, len(numbers))]
                num_bisequences = 1
            elif length == longest:
                longest_indices.append((current_start, len(numbers)))
                num_bisequences += 1

        # No valid bisubsequences found
        if longest == 0:
            return "-1"

        # Construct the result string
        result = f"{longest - 1} {num_bisequences}\n"  # Subtract 1 because we remove one non-square-free number
        result += "\n".join(f"{start + 1} {end - 1}" for start, end in longest_indices)
        return result

# Read input data
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process data based on the problem requirement and write to output file
with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
    result = process_challenge(c, arr)
    file.write(result)
```

This should produce the correct output according to the challenge's specifications. The implementation now correctly handles both tasks, identifying square-free numbers and the longest bisubsequence that can be obtained by removing a single non-square-free number that is not at the beginning or end of the sequence.

The provided solution does not correctly identify bisubsequences (a subsequence with exactly one non-square-free number being removed) according to the problem's definition. The expected output indicates that we should look for continuous sequences of square-free numbers that can be achieved by removing a single value that is not square-free from the sequence, ensuring that the removed non-square-free number is not at the starting or ending of the sequence.

To fix this, we need to change the approach: We will iterate over the numbers and look for sequences of square-free numbers. When we encounter a non-square-free number, we'll check if it can be removed to form a valid bisubsequence, considering it's not the first or last element. We'll keep track of the longest such sequences and their start and end indices.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):

# Initialize variables for longest bisubsequence

# Task 1: Count square-free numbers in the sequence
if c == 1:
    count_square_free = sum(is_square_free(num) for num in numbers)
    result = str(count_square_free)

# Task 2: Find the longest bisubsequence(s)
elif c == 2:
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        # Start of a potential bisubsequence
        if is_square_free(numbers[i]):
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and is_square_free(numbers[j]):
                j += 1
            
            # Now j is the index of the first non-square-free after a sequence of square-free numbers
            if j < n - 1:  # The non-square-free number cannot be the last one
                k = j + 1
                while k < n and is_square_free(numbers[k]):
                    k += 1
                # Now k is the end of the bisubsequence
                length = k - i - 1  # Exclude the non-square-free number
                if length > longest_length:
                    longest_length = length
                    longest_count = 1
                    longest_bisubsequences = [(i + 1, k)]
                elif length == longest_length:
                    longest_count += 1
                    longest_bisubsequences.append((i + 1, k))
                i = k  # Continue from the end of the bisubsequence
            else:
                break  # No valid bisubsequence can be found starting from index i
        else:

The result differs from the expected output because the end index of the bisubsequence is not correctly calculated. The value at index `j` is the first non-square-free number after a sequence of square-free numbers, so the bisubsequence should end at `j`, not `k - 1`. 

Also, the start index should be incremented by 1, as arrays in Python are zero-indexed, but the problem statement seems to expect one-indexing based on the expected output.

Let's correct the solution to properly calculate the bisubsequence indices:

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(n):
    for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (p * p) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to find the longest bisubsequence
def find_longest_bisubsequence(numbers):
    max_len = 0
    bisubsequences = []
    sq_free_seq_start = None

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if is_square_free(numbers[i]):
            if sq_free_seq_start is None:
                sq_free_seq_start = i
        else:
            if sq_free_seq_start is not None and i - sq_free_seq_start > max_len and i - sq_free_seq_start > 1:
                bisubsequences = [(sq_free_seq_start + 1, i)]
                max_len = i - sq_free_seq_start
            elif sq_free_seq_start is not None and i - sq_free_seq_start == max_len:
                bisubsequences.append((sq_free_seq_start + 1, i))
            sq_free_seq_start = None

    return (max_len, bisubsequences)

# Read input data
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process data based on the problem requirement and write to output file
if c == 1:
    count_square_free = sum(is_square_free(num) for num in numbers)
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count_square_free) + '\n')
elif c == 2:
    max_len, bisubsequences = find_longest_bisubsequence(numbers)
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        if max_len == 0:
            file.write('-1\n')
        else:
            file.write(f"{max_len - 1} {len(bisubsequences)}\n")  # subtract 1 for the non-square-free number
            for start, end in bisubsequences:
                file.write(f"{start} {end}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly identify the start and end indices of the longest bisubsequence(s), write the correct number of such bisubsequences, and adhere to the problem statement's expectations. The length reported for the bisubsequence is also decremented by 1 as expected, to account for the non-square-free number that is removed. The result is written to `oneout.out`.

The output differs from the expected result because the algorithm incorrectly calculates the bisubsequence. We need to find the longest bisubsequence that includes square-free numbers and results from removing exactly one non-square-free number. The indices for such bisubsequences are also not correctly mapped to the expected output format.

Let's implement the solution with a proper approach:

1. Iterate over the sequence to identify square-free numbers.
2. Keep track of the start and end indices of sequences of square-free numbers.
3. When a non-square-free number is encountered, check if removing it results in a longer bisubsequence.
4. Ensure the indices are adjusted to one-based indexing as expected in the output.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (i * i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to find the longest bisubsequence
def longest_bisubsequence(arr):
    square_free_indices = [-1]  # Start with an invalid index to handle leading non-square-free numbers
    # Identify all square-free numbers and their indices
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if is_square_free(num):
            square_free_indices.append(i)

    # Append an invalid index at the end to handle trailing non-square-free numbers
    square_free_indices.append(len(arr))

    max_length = 0
    bisubsequences = []
    # Iterate through square_free_indices to find the longest bisubsequence
    for i in range(1, len(square_free_indices) - 1):
        # Calculate the length excluding the current non-square-free number
        length = square_free_indices[i + 1] - square_free_indices[i - 1] - 1
        if length > max_length:
            max_length = length
            bisubsequences = [(square_free_indices[i - 1] + 2, square_free_indices[i + 1])]  # Convert to 1-based indexing
        elif length == max_length:
            bisubsequences.append((square_free_indices[i - 1] + 2, square_free_indices[i + 1]))  # Convert to 1-based indexing

    return max_length, bisubsequences

# Read input data
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the task
if task == 1:
    result = sum(is_square_free(num) for num in numbers)
elif task == 2:
    max_length, bisubsequences = longest_bisubsequence(numbers)
    if max_length == 0:
        result = "-1"
    else:
        bisubsequences_output = "\n".join(f"{start} {end}" for start, end in bisubsequences)
        result = f"{max_length} {len(bisubsequences)}\n{bisubsequences_output}"

# Write output data
with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{result}\n" if task == 1 else result)
```

Now, the code should correctly find the longest bisubsequence by considering the sequences of square-free numbers and properly handling non-square-free numbers that need to be removed. The indices are converted to 1-based indexing, and the output is written to the file `oneout.out` as expected.

The found output is incorrect because the approach taken to identify the bisubsequences is not considering the correct indices for bisubsequences. Specifically, the code incorrectly includes the non-square-free number in the bisubsequence, which results in an incorrect start index.

To fix the issues, we need to adjust the strategy to properly find the longest sequence of square-free numbers that can be created by removing exactly one non-square-free number. We should also ensure that the non-square-free number is not the first or last number of the list.

Let's write a new solution with this approach:

```python
import math

# Check if a number is square-free (liber de pătrate)
def is_square_free(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for factor in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (factor * factor) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Read input data from file
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    nums = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Solve task 1: count square-free numbers in the sequence
if c == 1:
    square_free_count = sum(is_square_free(x) for x in nums)
    result = str(square_free_count)

# Solve task 2: find the longest bisubsequence
elif c == 2:
    longest_seq = 0
    seq_count = 0
    sequences = []

    # Iterate through the numbers to find the longest bisubsequence
    for i in range(1, n - 1):  # Start from 1 and end at n-2 to avoid the ends
        if not is_square_free(nums[i]):
            left = i - 1
            right = i + 1
            # Expand to the left
            while left >= 0 and is_square_free(nums[left]):
                left -= 1
            # Expand to the right
            while right < n and is_square_free(nums[right]):
                right += 1
            # Calculate the length of the bisubsequence
            length = right - left - 2  # Exclude the non-square-free number and the ends
            if length > longest_seq:
                longest_seq = length
                sequences = [(left + 2, right)]  # Store 1-based index
                seq_count = 1
            elif length == longest_seq:
                sequences.append((left + 2, right))
                seq_count += 1

    if longest_seq == 0:
        result = '-1'
    else:
        result = f"{longest_seq} {seq_count}\n"
        result += "\n".join(f"{start} {end - 1}" for start, end in sequences)

# Write output data
with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(result + ('\n' if c == 1 else ''))
```

This solution should now find the correct bisubsequences as per the problem statement. It ensures that the non-square-free number that gets removed to form a bisubsequence is not at the beginning or end of the sequence. The start and end indices for the sequences are reported in a 1-based format, and the output is written to `oneout.out`.
