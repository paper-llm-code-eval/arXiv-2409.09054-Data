Definim un număr ***liber de pătrate*** ca fiind un număr natural care nu are ca divizor niciun pătrat perfect mai mare ca $1$. Prin convenție, $1$ este considerat *liber de pătrate*.

Așadar, șirul numerelor *libere de pătrate* este: $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, \dots$

Se consideră un șir de $N$ numere naturale $X_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, unde $N$ este un număr natural.

Definim o ***bisecvență*** ca un subșir nevid obținut prin eliminarea dintr-o secvență a unui număr care nu este la începutul sau la sfârșitul secvenței.

# Cerințe
1) Să se determine câte numere *libere de pătrate* conține șirul dat.
2) Să se determine cea mai lungă *bisecvență* din șir formată din numere *libere de pătrate*, obținută prin eliminarea unui număr care **nu** este *liber de pătrate*.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `oneout.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$, reprezentând cerința, pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$ iar pe a treia linie $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, în fișierul de ieșire `oneout.out` se va scrie numărul de numere *libere de pătrate* din șir.

Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$:
- Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `oneout.out` se vor scrie două numere $L$ și $K$ despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $L$ reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *bisecvențe* cu proprietățile cerute, iar $K$ reprezintă numărul de *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă existente în șir.
- Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor scrie indicii de început și de sfârșit ai fiecărei *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă găsite, în ordinea crescătoare a indicelui de start, despărțite printr-un spațiu.
- Dacă șirul nu conține nicio *bisecvență* cu proprietățile cerute, în fișierul de ieșire se va scrie `-1`.

# Restricții și precizări
- $3 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $2 \leq X_i \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Lungimea unei *bisecvențe* reprezintă numărul de numere din aceasta.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 37 de puncte $C = 1$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 24 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 25$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 63 de puncte $C = 2$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 23 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 101$.

The results differ because the algorithm incorrectly calculates the length of the subsequence and includes the non-square-free number within the range. The length should be the number of square-free numbers between two non-square-free numbers, not including the indices of those non-square-free numbers themselves.

The issue lies in the implementation of the Task 2 logic, specifically how the start and end indices of the subsequence are determined and how the length is calculated. The calculation of the length of the subsequence (`length = end - start`) incorrectly includes the non-square-free number, leading to an off-by-one error. Instead, the length should be calculated as `length = end - start - 1`.

Additionally, when writing the output for Task 2 to the `oneout.out` file, the indices for the subsequences should be incremented by 1 to match the problem statement, which asks for 1-based indices.

Let's fix the solution based on the observations:

```python
# This function determines if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(x):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):

# Task 1: Count square-free numbers
if task == 1:
    result = sum(1 for x in sequence if is_square_free(x))
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Task 2: Find the longest subsequence of square-free numbers
elif task == 2:
    max_length = 0
    subsequences = []
    last_non_free = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if not is_square_free(sequence[i]):
            if i - last_non_free - 1 > max_length:
                max_length = i - last_non_free - 1
                subsequences = [(last_non_free + 2, i)]
            elif i - last_non_free - 1 == max_length:
                subsequences.append((last_non_free + 2, i))
            last_non_free = i
    
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        if not subsequences:
            outfile.write('-1\n')

            for subseq in subsequences:
                outfile.write(f'{subseq[0]} {subseq[1] - 1}\n')
```

This updated solution should now provide the correct results by accurately determining the length of the bisubsequences and by correctly formatting the output with 1-based indices.

The discrepancy in the results is due to a mistake in the calculation of the bisubsequence's length and the indices recorded in the output. The issue arises from not correctly identifying subsequences that contain square-free numbers only. The program should identify the longest contiguous subsequence of square-free numbers which is possible by removing one non-square-free number.

The previous solution attempt does not account for the fact that the non-square-free number we remove could be at either end of the contiguous sequence of square-free numbers. To fix this, we need to iterate through the sequence to find all contiguous subsequences of square-free numbers, keeping track of their lengths, and then consider the removal of a single non-square-free number from either end to find the longest valid bisubsequence.

Let's correct the implementation:

```python
# This function determines if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(x):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
        if x % (i*i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Read input file
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as infile:
    task = int(infile.readline().strip())
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Task 1: Count square-free numbers
if task == 1:
    result = sum(1 for x in sequence if is_square_free(x))
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Task 2: Find the longest subsequence of square-free numbers
elif task == 2:
    max_length = 0
    subsequences = []
    start = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if not is_square_free(sequence[i]):
            length = i - start
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                subsequences = [(start, i)]
            elif length == max_length:
                subsequences.append((start, i))
            start = i + 1

    # Check the last subsequence if it ends with square-free numbers
    if is_square_free(sequence[-1]):
        length = n - start
        if length > max_length:
            max_length = length
            subsequences = [(start, n)]
        elif length == max_length:
            subsequences.append((start, n))

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        if max_length <= 1:
            outfile.write('-1\n')
        else:
            # The actual length of bisubsequence is max_length - 1, as one non-square-free number is removed
            outfile.write(f'{max_length - 1} {len(subsequences)}\n')
            for subseq in subsequences:
                # Output the indices of the bisubsequence (1-based), considering the removal of a non-square-free number
                # The non-square-free number can be removed from either end, hence subseq[0] + 1 and subseq[1] - 1
                outfile.write(f'{subseq[0] + 1} {subseq[1] - 1}\n')
```

This corrected solution should now provide the right results by accurately determining the longest bisubsequence and by correctly formatting the output with 1-based indices. It also handles the case where the last subsequence ends with square-free numbers. The length of each bisubsequence is the number of square-free numbers in it, which is one less than the length of the contiguous subsequence of square-free numbers that includes a non-square-free number at one end.

The results differ because the solution is incorrectly calculating the longest bisubsequence. The bisubsequence should be a contiguous subsequence of square-free numbers, with a single non-square-free number removed, which is not at the start or end of the sequence. The current implementation is considering removing a non-square-free number only at the ends, which is incorrect.

To correct this, we need to check for contiguous subsequences of square-free numbers and see if we can extend them by including a non-square-free number from either side (but not both). This requires a different approach to the problem.

Let's fix the solution by implementing the correct algorithm:

```python
# This function determines if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(x):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
        if x % (i*i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Read input file

    sequence = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Task 1: Count square-free numbers
if task == 1:
    result = sum(1 for x in sequence if is_square_free(x))
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Task 2: Find the longest bisubsequence of square-free numbers
elif task == 2:
    max_length = 0
    subsequences = []
    start = 0
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if not is_square_free(sequence[i]):
            # Check the sequence to the left of the non-square-free number
            left_seq_length = i - start
            # Check the sequence to the right of the non-square-free number
            end = i + 1
            while end < n and is_square_free(sequence[end]):
                end += 1
            right_seq_length = end - (i + 1)
            # The length of the bisubsequence is the sum of both sides
            length = left_seq_length + right_seq_length
            if length > max_length:
                max_length = length
                subsequences = [(start+1, end-1)]  # Convert to 1-based index, exclude the non-square-free
            elif length == max_length:
                subsequences.append((start+1, end-1))  # Convert to 1-based index, exclude the non-square-free
            start = i + 1

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        if max_length == 0:
            outfile.write('-1\n')
        else:
            outfile.write(f'{max_length} {len(subsequences)}\n')
            for subseq in subsequences:
                outfile.write(f'{subseq[0]} {subseq[1]}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly determine the longest bisubsequence by considering the removal of non-square-free numbers that are not at the beginning or the end of the sequence. It also ensures that only the length of the remaining square-free numbers is counted. The output is adjusted to be 1-based as per the problem statement.

The results differ because the last bisubsequence is being ended prematurely. When identifying the bisubsequence, it must include the square-free numbers to the right of the last non-square-free number. The previous fix attempted to resolve this issue but fell short by not appropriately updating the start index after considering a non-square-free number. Additionally, the end index of the last bisubsequence was not recorded correctly.

Let's implement the solution correctly now:

```python
# This function determines if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(x):
    for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
        if x % (i*i) == 0:

# Task 1: Count square-free numbers
if task == 1:
    result = sum(1 for x in sequence if is_square_free(x))
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:

# Task 2: Find the longest bisubsequence of square-free numbers
elif task == 2:
    max_length = 0
    bisubsequences = []
    free_start = 0 if is_square_free(sequence[0]) else -1
    free_end = -1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if is_square_free(sequence[i]):
            if free_start == -1:
                free_start = i
            free_end = i
        elif free_end - free_start + 1 > max_length:
            max_length = free_end - free_start + 1
            bisubsequences = [(free_start + 1, free_end + 1)]  # Convert to 1-based indexing
            free_start = -1  # Reset the start index for the next subsequence
        else:
            free_start = -1  # Reset the start index for the next subsequence

    # Handle the case where the sequence ends with a square-free number
    if free_end - free_start + 1 > max_length:
        max_length = free_end - free_start + 1
        bisubsequences = [(free_start + 1, free_end + 1)]

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        if not bisubsequences:

            for bisubseq in bisubsequences:
                outfile.write(f'{bisubseq[0]} {bisubseq[1]}\n')
```

This solution takes into account all square-free numbers between non-square-free numbers and correctly updates the indices when a non-square-free number is encountered. The start index of the next square-free subsequence is reset after a non-square-free number is found. The end index is recorded correctly for the last bisubsequence. The output uses 1-based indexing as per the problem statement, and it should now produce the expected result.

The differences in the results are due to a bug in the updated solution, which incorrectly resets the start index (`free_start`) after encountering a non-square-free number and fails to consider that the non-square-free number could be in the middle of a longer bisubsequence.

The updated solution should keep track of the start and end indices of square-free subsequences and consider removing one non-square-free number from these subsequences to find the longest one.

Let's fix the solution by implementing this strategy correctly:

```python
# This function checks if a number is square-free by dividing by all square numbers up to its square root
def is_square_free(x):
    if x == 1:

This revision correctly resets the start index (`current_start`) and length (`current_length`) after encountering a non-square-free number. It also properly considers subsequences of square-free numbers that have a non-square-free number at the end, which can be removed to form a bisubsequence. The output is now in 1-based indexing, and it should produce the expected result.

The issue with the previous solution is that it resets the `current_start` and `current_length` whenever it encounters a non-square-free number, which means it doesn't correctly account for a non-square-free number that can be removed from the middle of a sequence to potentially create a longer bisubsequence.

To fix the solution, we'll need to iterate over the sequence, keeping track of the number of consecutive square-free numbers. When we encounter a non-square-free number, we'll need to remember the last position where we saw a non-square-free number to consider removing it to potentially form a longer bisubsequence. This requires maintaining variables for the previous non-square-free index, the start of the current square-free sequence, and the length of the longest bisubsequence found so far.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
# This function determines if a number is square-free
def is_square_free(x):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
        if (x % (i * i)) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Read input file
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as infile:
    task = int(infile.readline().strip())
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Task 1: Count square-free numbers
if task == 1:
    result = sum(is_square_free(x) for x in sequence)
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Task 2: Find the longest bisubsequence of square-free numbers
elif task == 2:
    max_length = 0
    prev_non_free_index = -1
    start_index = 0
    bisubsequences = []

    for i in range(n):
        if is_square_free(sequence[i]):
            if max_length < i - start_index:
                max_length = i - start_index
                bisubsequences = [(start_index + 1, i)]
        else:
            if i - prev_non_free_index > max_length and prev_non_free_index != -1:
                max_length = i - prev_non_free_index
                bisubsequences = [(prev_non_free_index + 2, i)]
            start_index = i
            prev_non_free_index = i

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as outfile:
        if max_length == 0:
            outfile.write('-1\n')
        else:
            outfile.write(f'{max_length} {len(bisubsequences)}\n')
            for start, end in bisubsequences:
                outfile.write(f'{start} {end}\n')
```

In this fixed solution, we keep track of the previous non-square-free index (`prev_non_free_index`) and the start of the current sequence of square-free numbers (`start_index`). When we encounter a non-square-free number, we check if the sequence length since the last non-square-free number is the longest we've seen so far, considering removal of the previous non-square-free number. We then update `start_index` to the current index and `prev_non_free_index`. The output is written with 1-based indices, excluding the non-square-free number at the current index.

This solution should produce the expected result.
