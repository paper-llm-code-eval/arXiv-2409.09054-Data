Pasiunea Mirunei este să coloreze. Vacanţa trecută şi-a petrecut-o la bunica ei la ţară şi pentru că se cam plictisea s-a gândit să vopsească gardul de la casa bunicii.

Gardul este compus din $N$ scânduri dispuse una lângă alta. Miruna a găsit în garajul bunicii $5$ cutii de vopsea de culori diferite: **albă**, **albastră**, **roşie**, **verde** şi **galbenă**. Când a vopsit gardul, Miruna a respectat următoarele reguli:
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **alb**, următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **albastru**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **albastru**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **alb** sau **roşu**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **roşu**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **albastru** sau **verde**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **verde**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **roșu** sau **galben**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **galben**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **verde**

După ce a și-a terminat treaba Miruna își admira “opera de artă” și se întreba în câte moduri diferite ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii. 

# Cerinţă

Upon reviewing the provided code and the discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs, it appears that there is an issue with the state transitions in the `count_coloring_ways` function. The transitions must strictly follow the rules set in the problem statement, however, there has been a misunderstanding concerning the possible transitions from "red" and "blue." Let's correct the transition logic to adhere to the rules of the problem.

Here are the correct transitions according to the rules:
- White can only follow blue.
- Blue can follow white or red.
- Red can follow blue.
- Green can follow red.
- Yellow can only follow green.

Now, let's fix the solution by updating the state transition logic, and rewrite the entire solution:

```python
# culori.py
def read_number_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def write_number_to_file(file_path, number):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(number) + '\n')

def count_coloring_ways(n):
    # Initialize the counts for a single board
    # The count is stored as follows:
    # [white, blue, red, green, yellow]
    # At the start, we can pick any of the colors hence initializing all to 1
    counts = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

    # Update the counts for each additional board
    for _ in range(1, n):
        new_counts = [0] * 5
        new_counts[0] = counts[1]  # White can only follow blue
        new_counts[1] = counts[0] + counts[2]  # Blue can follow white or red
        new_counts[2] = counts[1]  # Red can only follow blue
        new_counts[3] = counts[2]  # Green can only follow red
        new_counts[4] = counts[3]  # Yellow can only follow green
        counts = new_counts

    return sum(counts)

# Read N from file
N = read_number_from_file('culori.in')

# Count the ways to color the fence
result = count_coloring_ways(N)

# Write the result to file
write_number_to_file('culori.out', result)
```

The above code should now correctly calculate the number of ways Miruna can paint the fence according to the rules given and write the correct result to the output file 'culori.out'.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that there's still an error in the state transition logic. To resolve this, we need to carefully reconsider the rules provided in the problem statement and map out how each color can be followed by another:

- White can only be followed by blue.
- Blue can be followed by white or red.
- Red can be followed by blue or green.
- Green can be followed by red or yellow.
- Yellow can only be followed by green.

With these rules in mind, we need to correctly update the state transition counts for each color on each step. Let's correct the code with these proper transitions:

```python
# culori.py
def read_number_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def write_number_to_file(file_path, number):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(number) + '\n')

def count_coloring_ways(n):
    # Initialize the counts for a single board
    # The count is stored as follows:
    # [white, blue, red, green, yellow]
    counts = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # The first board can only be white

    # Update the counts for each additional board
    for _ in range(1, n):
        new_counts = [0] * 5
        new_counts[0] = counts[1]  # White can only follow blue
        new_counts[1] = counts[0] + counts[2]  # Blue can follow white or red
        new_counts[2] = counts[1] + counts[3]  # Red can follow blue or green
        new_counts[3] = counts[2] + counts[4]  # Green can follow red or yellow
        new_counts[4] = counts[3]  # Yellow can only follow green
        counts = new_counts

    return sum(counts)

# Read N from file
N = read_number_from_file('culori.in')

# Count the ways to color the fence
result = count_coloring_ways(N)

# Write the result to file
write_number_to_file('culori.out', result)
```

This code correctly handles the state transitions according to the provided rules and should now give the correct number of ways the fence can be painted, outputting the result to 'culori.out'.

Apologies for the confusion with the previous responses. Let's re-evaluate the problem and implement the correct transition logic based on the rules provided in the problem statement.

The rules for the color transitions, once more, are as follows:

- White can only be followed by blue.
- Blue can be followed by white or red.
- Red can be followed by blue or green.
- Green can be followed by red or yellow.
- Yellow can only be followed by green.

We should initialize our counts with the first board painted with any color, as the question doesn't specify a starting color. Then we'll implement the correct transitions according to the rules for each subsequent board.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def count_coloring_ways(n):
    # The counts are stored as follows: [white, blue, red, green, yellow]
    # The first board can be painted with any of the 5 colors
    counts = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # One way to paint each color for the first board

    # Update the counts for each additional board
    for _ in range(1, n):
        new_white = counts[1]  # White can only follow blue
        new_blue = counts[0] + counts[2]  # Blue can follow white or red
        new_red = counts[1] + counts[3]  # Red can follow blue or green
        new_green = counts[2] + counts[4]  # Green can follow red or yellow
        new_yellow = counts[3]  # Yellow can only follow green

        # Update counts for the next iteration
        counts = [new_white, new_blue, new_red, new_green, new_yellow]

    return sum(counts)

# Read N from file
with open('culori.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Count the ways to color the fence
result = count_coloring_ways(N)

# Write the result to file
with open('culori.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This code should now properly follow the rules and calculate the correct number of ways the fence can be painted. It reads the number of boards from `culori.in`, computes the possible arrangements, and writes the result to `culori.out`.
