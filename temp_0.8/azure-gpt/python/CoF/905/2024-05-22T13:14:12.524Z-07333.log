Împăratul cel bătrân vrea să împartă sacii cu galbeni din vistieria palatului celor $K$ feciori ai săi, numerotați de la $1$ la $K$ în ordinea vârstei. Feciorul cu numărul $1$ este cel mai mare, iar mezinul are numărul $K$.

În vistierie sunt $N$ saci plini cu galbeni, așezați în linie, atât de grei încât nu li se poate schimba ordinea, iar pe fiecare sac este scris numărul de galbeni pe care îi conține.
\
Împăratul îl cheamă pe unul dintre feciori și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_1$ saci!”. Feciorul ia sacii și pleacă fericit. Apoi, împăratul cheamă alt fecior și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_2$ saci dintre cei rămași!”. Și așa mai departe, până ajunge la ultimul fecior chemat, căruia îi dă toți sacii rămași.

El nu are o ordine anume în care își cheamă feciorii dar are grijă să cheme fiecare fecior exact o dată. Totodată, pentru a evita certurile între ei, este atent ca fiecare fecior să primească cel puțin un sac cu galbeni, dar **să NU primească în total mai mulți galbeni ca un frate mai mare decât el**. Cel mai mic dintre feciorii împăratului este și cel mai viteaz, așa că împăratul ar vrea să îi dea lui o sumă de bani cât mai mare, fără a-i supăra pe ceilalți feciori ai săi.

# Cerință
Cum ar putea împărți împăratul sacii?

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mostenire.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $K$, separate de un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural, reprezentând numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac, în ordinea în care aceștia urmează să fie distribuiți fiilor.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `mostenire.out` va conține pe prima linie suma de galbeni pe care o va primi fiul cel mic de la împărat. Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al feciorului, respectiv numărul de saci $x_i$ pe care îi primește acesta, în ordinea în care au fost chemați de împărat.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq K \leq 100$
- $K \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac va fi între $1$ și $100\ 000$.
- Galbenii din oricare dintre saci nu pot fi împărțiți mai multor frați.
- Numărul total de galbeni aflați în vistierie este mai mic sau egal cu $10^9$.
- Împăratul cel bătrân nu are doi feciori cu aceeași vârstă.
- **Puteți afișa orice soluție în care mezinul primește numărul maxim posibil de galbeni**.
- Pentru fiecare test, afișarea corectă a numărului maxim de galbeni primiți de mezin este notată cu $40\%$ din punctajul alocat testului.
- Pentru teste valorând 10 puncte, $N = K$ și $N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste valorând 30 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 15$.
- Pentru teste valorând 50 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 100$.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's re-evaluate the problem and correct the solution accordingly.

The initial solution attempted to use a binary search to find the maximum number of gold the youngest son can receive, but there were issues in the logic used to perform this search. The calculation of the maximum gold for the youngest son did not correctly account for the constraints and order of son distribution. Additionally, the distribution logic did not correctly handle the allocation of sacks to the sons based on the youngest son's maximum gold.

The critical aspect to consider is that we need to ensure that the youngest son gets the maximum possible gold, which implies that we should try to give each elder son the least amount of gold while respecting the constraints. This would mean starting with the youngest son and ensuring he gets at least one sack, then proceeding to the next younger son, and so on.

Let's correct the solution with a new approach:

1. Sort the sacks in non-increasing order to allocate the larger sacks to the elder sons first, as required by the constraints.
2. Perform a binary search on the maximum possible gold the youngest son can receive.
3. Check if the allocation is possible with each binary search iteration by giving each son at least one sack and not more gold than the elder son received.

We'll rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def is_possible(K, sacks, mid):
    counts = [1] * K  # Each son should get at least one sack
    sums = [0] * K    # Sums of gold for each son
    son = K - 1       # Start with the youngest son

    # Distribute sacks
    for sack in reversed(sacks):
        if sums[son] + sack <= mid:  # If we can add the sack to the current son
            sums[son] += sack
        else:  # Move to the next elder son
            son -= 1
            if son < 0:
                return False  # Not possible to distribute to all sons
            sums[son] += sack
            counts[son] += 1

    # Check if all sons got at least one sack
    return all(count >= 1 for count in counts)


def distribute_gold(N, K, sacks):
    left, right = 0, sum(sacks)
    res = 0

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if is_possible(K, sacks, mid):
            res = mid  # Found a possible distribution
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    # Determine the actual distribution
    sums = [0] * K
    counts = [0] * K
    son = K - 1
    for sack in reversed(sacks):
        if sums[son] + sack <= res:
            sums[son] += sack
            counts[son] += 1
        else:
            son -= 1
            sums[son] += sack
            counts[son] += 1

    return res, sums, counts


# Read from 'mostenire.in'
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(infile.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

# Sort the sacks in non-increasing order
sacks.sort(reverse=True)

# Calculate distribution
youngest_son_gold, sums, counts = distribute_gold(N, K, sacks)

# Write to 'mostenire.out'
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{youngest_son_gold}\n")
    for i in range(K):
        son = K - i
        outfile.write(f"{son} {counts[i]}\n")
```

This rewritten solution should correctly determine the maximum number of gold the youngest son can receive and determine the allocation for each son while respecting the constraints. It writes the result to `mostenire.out` based on the calculated distribution.

The expected output indicates that the youngest son (son number 3) should receive 4 sacks totaling 10 gold coins, while the eldest son (son number 1) and the middle son (son number 2) should each receive 2 sacks. The original algorithm wrongly sorted the sacks in descending order, which led to incorrect distribution, as it allowed the possibility of elder sons receiving fewer sacks than the younger ones.

To correct this, we must ensure that we follow the rule that each son must receive at least one sack and that no younger son receives more gold than an elder son. We need to distribute the sacks without sorting them, as we cannot change their order.

Here is a corrected implementation of the solution:

```python
def distribute_gold(N, K, sacks):
    # We use binary search to find the minimal greatest sum that can be achieved by the youngest son.
    # This is the maximum amount of gold that the youngest son can receive.
    left, right = min(sacks), sum(sacks) // K
    while left < right:
        mid = (right + left + 1) // 2
        count, current_sum = 1, 0
        for gold in sacks:
            if current_sum + gold <= mid:
                current_sum += gold
            else:
                count += 1
                current_sum = gold
        if count <= K:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    youngest_son_gold = left
    remaining_gold = sum(sacks)
    distribution = []

    # Now we distribute the gold to each son,
    # starting from the eldest to the youngest.
    for i in range(1, K+1):
        current_sum = 0
        while current_sum + sacks[0] <= youngest_son_gold and remaining_gold - sacks[0] >= youngest_son_gold * (K-i):
            current_sum += sacks.pop(0)
            remaining_gold -= current_sum
        distribution.append((i, current_sum // youngest_son_gold))

    # Finally, we assign the remaining sacks to the youngest son.
    distribution.append((K, len(sacks)))

    return youngest_son_gold, distribution

# Read from 'mostenire.in'
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(infile.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate distribution
youngest_son_gold, distribution = distribute_gold(N, K, sacks)

# Write to 'mostenire.out'
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{youngest_son_gold}\n")
    for son_info in distribution:
        outfile.write(f"{son_info[0]} {son_info[1]}\n")
```

This implementation reads the number of sacks and the number of sons from 'mostenire.in', determines the maximum gold the youngest son can receive, calculates the distribution of gold among the sons, and writes the results to 'mostenire.out'. It does not sort the sacks and ensures that the order of the sacks is preserved.

The previously provided solution still did not meet the requirements. The primary issue is with the way the binary search is conducted and how the distribution is calculated post-search. The binary search should find the maximum sum the youngest son can get, which is then used as a constraint for what each son can get at most. The distribution logic should ensure that each son gets as few sacks as possible starting from the eldest to the youngest while adhering to the constraints.

Let's rewrite the solution, ensuring that we allocate at least one sack to each son, and that no younger son gets more gold than any older son.

```python
def allocate_sacks(N, K, sacks):
    # Start with the maximum amount the youngest can get, which is the sum of all sacks divided by K
    max_gold_for_youngest = sum(sacks) // K
    
    # Initialize distribution array and the current sum for the youngest son
    distribution = [0] * (K + 1)
    current_sum = 0

    # Iterate from the end (youngest son) to the beginning (eldest son)
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        if current_sum + sacks[i] <= max_gold_for_youngest:
            current_sum += sacks[i]
            distribution[K] += 1
        else:
            # Move to the next son if the current sum would be too high
            K -= 1
            current_sum = sacks[i]
            distribution[K] += 1
    
    # The youngest son's gold is the current sum after distribution
    youngest_son_gold = current_sum
    return youngest_son_gold, distribution[1:]

# Read from 'mostenire.in'
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(infile.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate distribution
youngest_son_gold, distribution = allocate_sacks(N, K, sacks)

# Write to 'mostenire.out'
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{youngest_son_gold}\n")
    current_son = 1
    for sacks_given in distribution:
        outfile.write(f"{current_son} {sacks_given}\n")
        current_son += 1
```

This approach calculates the maximum gold the youngest son can get by dividing the total gold by the number of sons. It then iterates backwards through the sacks, allocating as few as possible to each son while ensuring the youngest son does not receive more than the maximum calculated amount. It writes the allocation to `mostenire.out` starting from the eldest to the youngest son, ensuring each son is given at least one sack and the constraints are met.

The output is incorrect because the code doesn't ensure that each son receives the correct number of sacks. The allocation strategy needs to ensure that each son receives at least one sack, and the distribution of sacks must start from the eldest son and then proceed to the youngest, with no younger son receiving more gold than their elder brothers.

Here's the correct strategy:
1. Use binary search to find the maximum amount of gold the youngest son can get, considering that each son must get at least one sack.
2. Once the maximum amount is found, distribute the sacks from the first to the last, ensuring each son receives the correct number of sacks.

We'll rewrite the entire solution with this strategy in mind:

```python
def is_valid_distribution(sacks, K, max_gold):
    sons = [0] * K
    current_son = 0
    for sack in sacks:
        # Try to give the current son the current sack
        if sons[current_son] + sack <= max_gold:
            sons[current_son] += sack
        else:
            # Move to the next son if the current son cannot take more
            current_son += 1
            if current_son >= K:
                return False
            sons[current_son] = sack
    return True

def binary_search_max_gold(sacks, K):
    left, right = 0, sum(sacks)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if is_valid_distribution(sacks, K, mid):
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return left

def allocate_sacks(sacks, K, max_gold):
    distribution = [(i + 1, 0) for i in range(K)]
    current_son = 0
    sacks_for_current_son = 0
    for sack in sacks:
        if distribution[current_son][1] + sack <= max_gold:
            sacks_for_current_son += 1
            distribution[current_son] = (distribution[current_son][0], sacks_for_current_son)
        else:
            current_son += 1
            sacks_for_current_son = 1
            distribution[current_son] = (distribution[current_son][0], sacks_for_current_son)
    return distribution

# Read from 'mostenire.in'
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(infile.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Binary search to find the maximum gold the youngest son can get
max_gold_for_youngest = binary_search_max_gold(sacks, K)

# Allocate sacks based on the maximum gold the youngest son can get
distribution = allocate_sacks(sacks, K, max_gold_for_youngest)

# Write to 'mostenire.out'
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{max_gold_for_youngest}\n")
    for son_num, sack_count in distribution:
        outfile.write(f"{son_num} {sack_count}\n")
```

This solution should provide the correct output by first determining the maximum gold amount that the youngest son can receive using a binary search. Then, it allocates the sacks to each son without giving any younger son more gold than the amount determined for the youngest. The output is written to `mostenire.out` in the required format.

The output is incorrect because the algorithm does not correctly divide the sacks among the sons according to the rules set by the emperor. The key to the solution is to ensure that the youngest son receives the maximum possible number of gold coins, while also making sure that no younger son receives more gold than an older one.

To achieve this, we can utilize a greedy approach that works as follows:

1. Starting from the eldest son, allocate him the minimum number of sacks such that any remaining sacks cannot give a greater sum to the younger sons.
2. Repeat this process for each son in descending age order until we reach the youngest son, who will receive the remaining sacks.

We can do this by iterating over the sacks from the start (eldest son's perspective) and allocating sacks to each son based on the conditions mentioned.

Let's implement this corrected solution:

```python
def distribute_gold(N, K, sacks):
    # Initialize the result list with K zeros (to store number of sacks each son gets)
    result = [0] * K
    # Start from the eldest son
    current_son = 0
    # Remaining number of sons to consider
    remaining_sons = K
    # Iterate over the sacks from eldest to youngest
    for i in range(N):
        # Check if the current son can take the current sack without
        # causing the sum of the remaining sacks to be greater than
        # the sum of the current son
        if sum(sacks[i:]) / remaining_sons <= sacks[i]:
            result[current_son] += 1
        else:
            # If not, move to the next son
            current_son += 1
            remaining_sons -= 1
            result[current_son] += 1

    # The sum for the youngest son
    youngest_sum = sum(sacks[-result[-1]:])

    return youngest_sum, result

# Read from 'mostenire.in'
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(infile.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate distribution
youngest_son_gold, distribution = distribute_gold(N, K, sacks)

# Write to 'mostenire.out'
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{youngest_son_gold}\n")
    sacks_taken = 0
    for son, sacks_count in enumerate(distribution, start=1):
        outfile.write(f"{son} {sacks_count}\n")
        sacks_taken += sacks_count
```

This solution should now correctly distribute the sacks according to the emperor's rules, ensuring that the youngest son receives the maximum possible sum of gold. It writes the result to `mostenire.out` with each son's number and the respective number of sacks they receive, in the order the emperor calls them.

---------- assistant ----------

The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which implies that the solution attempts to access an index in the `result` list that does not exist. This error occurs in the `distribute_gold` function where the `current_son` variable is used as an index for the `result` list. If the code incorrectly increments `current_son` beyond the last index of `result`, it will cause an out-of-bounds access.

The logic needs to ensure that the current son's index is always within the bounds of the list. It seems that the allocation logic is flawed, as it doesn't correctly handle moving to the next son when necessary. 

Let's rewrite the solution while incorporating correct logic for distributing the sacks to the sons:

```python
def distribute_sacks(N, K, sacks):
    # Initialize the list to store the distribution to each son
    distribution = [0] * K
    # Initialize each son's share with the first son getting the first sack
    shares = [sacks[0]] + [0] * (K-1)
    current_son = 0
    
    # Assign sacks to sons
    for i in range(1, N):
        # If the next sack can be given to the current son without violating the rule
        # that a younger son should not get more, give it to the current son.
        # Otherwise, move on to the next son.
        if current_son < K-1 and (shares[current_son]+sacks[i] > shares[current_son+1]):
            current_son += 1
        
        shares[current_son] += sacks[i]
        distribution[current_son] += 1
    
    # The youngest son's share is the last element in shares list
    youngest_share = shares[-1]

    # Correct the distribution to ensure each son gets at least one sack
    for i in range(K-1, 0, -1):
        if distribution[i] == 0:
            distribution[i] = 1
            distribution[i-1] -= 1

    return youngest_share, distribution

# Read input from 'mostenire.in'
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(infile.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate the distribution
youngest_share, distribution = distribute_sacks(N, K, sacks)

# Write the output to 'mostenire.out'
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{youngest_share}\n")
    for i, count in enumerate(distribution, 1):
        outfile.write(f"{i} {count}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly enforce that the youngest son does not receive more gold than any of the older sons, while also ensuring that each son receives at least one sack. The distribution is written to `mostenire.out` following the emperor's rules.
