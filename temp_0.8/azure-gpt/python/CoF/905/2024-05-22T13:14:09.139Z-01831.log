Împăratul cel bătrân vrea să împartă sacii cu galbeni din vistieria palatului celor $K$ feciori ai săi, numerotați de la $1$ la $K$ în ordinea vârstei. Feciorul cu numărul $1$ este cel mai mare, iar mezinul are numărul $K$.

În vistierie sunt $N$ saci plini cu galbeni, așezați în linie, atât de grei încât nu li se poate schimba ordinea, iar pe fiecare sac este scris numărul de galbeni pe care îi conține.
\
Împăratul îl cheamă pe unul dintre feciori și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_1$ saci!”. Feciorul ia sacii și pleacă fericit. Apoi, împăratul cheamă alt fecior și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_2$ saci dintre cei rămași!”. Și așa mai departe, până ajunge la ultimul fecior chemat, căruia îi dă toți sacii rămași.

El nu are o ordine anume în care își cheamă feciorii dar are grijă să cheme fiecare fecior exact o dată. Totodată, pentru a evita certurile între ei, este atent ca fiecare fecior să primească cel puțin un sac cu galbeni, dar **să NU primească în total mai mulți galbeni ca un frate mai mare decât el**. Cel mai mic dintre feciorii împăratului este și cel mai viteaz, așa că împăratul ar vrea să îi dea lui o sumă de bani cât mai mare, fără a-i supăra pe ceilalți feciori ai săi.

# Cerință
Cum ar putea împărți împăratul sacii?

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mostenire.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $K$, separate de un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural, reprezentând numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac, în ordinea în care aceștia urmează să fie distribuiți fiilor.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `mostenire.out` va conține pe prima linie suma de galbeni pe care o va primi fiul cel mic de la împărat. Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al feciorului, respectiv numărul de saci $x_i$ pe care îi primește acesta, în ordinea în care au fost chemați de împărat.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq K \leq 100$
- $K \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac va fi între $1$ și $100\ 000$.
- Galbenii din oricare dintre saci nu pot fi împărțiți mai multor frați.
- Numărul total de galbeni aflați în vistierie este mai mic sau egal cu $10^9$.
- Împăratul cel bătrân nu are doi feciori cu aceeași vârstă.
- **Puteți afișa orice soluție în care mezinul primește numărul maxim posibil de galbeni**.
- Pentru fiecare test, afișarea corectă a numărului maxim de galbeni primiți de mezin este notată cu $40\%$ din punctajul alocat testului.
- Pentru teste valorând 10 puncte, $N = K$ și $N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste valorând 30 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 15$.
- Pentru teste valorând 50 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 100$.

This python code snippet reads the input from `mostenire.in`, processes the data according to the problem requirements, and writes the result to `mostenire.out`. The algorithm ensures that the youngest sibling receives the maximum possible gold without his share exceeding the older siblings'. The time complexity is optimized by working from the youngest sibling back to the oldest, taking into account the number of sacks each sibling can receive without violating the rules.

Upon inspecting the output discrepancy, we can observe that the results differ because the code doesn't properly distribute the sacks according to the rules described in the challenge. The algorithm distributed more gold to the youngest (mezinul) than to the other siblings, which violates the rule that a younger sibling should not receive more gold than an older one.

Let's address this by implementing a different algorithm that takes into account the constraints:

1. The youngest should receive the largest sum possible, but not more than any older sibling.
2. Siblings are considered in reverse order, with the youngest being the last.

We can use binary search to find the maximum sum that the youngest can receive by trying to distribute the sacks starting with the maximum sum possible for the youngest and decreasing it until we find a valid distribution.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def valid_distribution(gold, K, max_gold_for_youngest):
    count = 0
    current_sum = 0
    for g in reversed(gold):
        if current_sum + g <= max_gold_for_youngest:
            current_sum += g
        else:
            current_sum = g
            count += 1
            if count == K:
                return False
    return True

# Read data from "mostenire.in"
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, K = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Binary search to find the maximum sum for the youngest
left, right = 0, sum(sacks)
max_gold_for_youngest = 0
while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if valid_distribution(sacks, K - 1, mid):
        max_gold_for_youngest = mid
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid - 1

# Distribute the sacks according to the found max sum for the youngest
distribution = [0] * K
current_sum = 0
current_kid = K - 1
for sack in reversed(sacks):
    if current_sum + sack <= max_gold_for_youngest and current_kid > 0:
        current_sum += sack
    else:
        distribution[current_kid] += 1
        if current_kid > 0:
            current_sum = sack
            current_kid -= 1

distribution[0] += 1  # Add the last sack to the oldest

# Write output to "mostenire.out"
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{max_gold_for_youngest}\n")
    sacks_distributed = 0
    for i, dist in enumerate(distribution[::-1]):
        fout.write(f"{K - i} {dist}\n")
        sacks_distributed += dist

fout.close()
fin.close()
```

This code reads and processes the data to find the maximum sum of gold that the youngest sibling can receive without getting more than the older siblings. It then distributes the sacks accordingly, ensuring that the distribution is valid and writes the results to `mostenire.out`.

The revised solution still does not yield the expected output. The main issue with the previous code is that it does not correctly implement the specified algorithm to ensure the youngest sibling receives the maximum possible sum of gold, while also adhering to the rule that no younger sibling should receive more than any older sibling.

Let's approach the problem with a new strategy. We will start by assigning one sack to each sibling from the oldest to the youngest. Then, we will attempt to assign the remaining sacks to the youngest sibling without violating the rule that each older sibling should receive at least as much gold as any younger sibling.

Here's the corrected solution, which follows the correct algorithm:

```python
# Read input
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

# Algorithm
def allocate_sacks(sacks, K):
    # Distribute one sack to each sibling to ensure each gets some gold
    gold_per_sibling = [0] * K
    for i in range(K):
        gold_per_sibling[i] = sacks.pop()

    # Attempt to give the remaining sacks to the youngest while ensuring fairness
    while sacks:
        # Give a sack to the youngest if it doesn't violate the rule
        if gold_per_sibling[-1] + sacks[-1] <= gold_per_sibling[-2]:
            gold_per_sibling[-1] += sacks.pop()
        else:
            # Find the right sibling to give the next sack
            for i in range(K - 2, -1, -1):
                if i == 0 or gold_per_sibling[i] + sacks[-1] <= gold_per_sibling[i - 1]:
                    gold_per_sibling[i] += sacks.pop()
                    break
    
    return gold_per_sibling

# Get the gold distribution
gold_distribution = allocate_sacks(sacks, K)

# Write output
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{gold_distribution[-1]}\n")
    # The oldest sibling is sibling 1, youngest is sibling K
    sacks_distributed = [0] * K
    for idx, gold in enumerate(gold_distribution):
        sibling_number = K - idx  # Reverse the order for output
        # Count how many sacks each sibling received
        sacks_distributed[sibling_number - 1] = gold_distribution[idx] - sum(sacks_distributed)
        file.write(f"{sibling_number} {sacks_distributed[sibling_number - 1]}\n")
```

This solution should correctly distribute the sacks and assign the maximum possible sum of gold to the youngest sibling, while respecting the rule that no younger sibling receives more than an older sibling. Now the output should match the expected result.

The latest implementation still doesn't produce the expected result, and it seems the allocation logic is flawed. We must ensure that each sibling gets a number of gold pieces that is not greater than what an older sibling gets, and the youngest should end up with the greatest permissible sum. The process must be done in such a way that every sibling receives at least one sack, starting from the eldest to the youngest.

To fix the solution, we will implement a different approach that first finds the maximum sum of gold the youngest can get, which will be the least amount that can be given to the eldest without breaking the rules. Then we will distribute the rest of the sacks in reverse order from youngest to eldest, ensuring that no younger sibling gets more gold than any older sibling.

Here is the corrected solution, which adheres to the problem constraints:

```python
# Helper function to determine if a certain minimum amount can be allocated
# to each of the siblings while allowing the youngest to have the maximum sum.
def can_allocate_siblings(sacks, K, min_amount):
    siblings = [0] * K
    for sack in reversed(sacks):
        if siblings[-1] + sack <= min_amount:
            siblings[-1] += sack
        else:
            if K == 1:
                return False
            K -= 1
            siblings[K-1] += sack
    return True

# Read input
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Binary search to find the maximum possible amount for the youngest sibling
left, right = 0, sum(sacks) // K
max_amount_for_youngest = 0
while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if can_allocate_siblings(sacks, K, mid):
        max_amount_for_youngest = mid
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid - 1

# Allocate sacks starting with the youngest sibling
allocation = [(0, 0)] * K  # Each tuple will hold (sibling_number, number_of_sacks)
current_sibling = K
current_amount = 0
current_sacks = 0
for sack in sacks:
    if current_sibling == 1 or current_amount + sack <= max_amount_for_youngest:
        current_amount += sack
        current_sacks += 1
    else:
        allocation[current_sibling-1] = (current_sibling, current_sacks)
        current_sibling -= 1
        current_amount = sack
        current_sacks = 1
allocation[current_sibling-1] = (current_sibling, current_sacks)

# Write output
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_amount_for_youngest}\n")
    for alloc in allocation:
        file.write(f"{alloc[0]} {alloc[1]}\n")
```

This solution uses a binary search to find the maximum sum of gold the youngest sibling can have, which is then used as a constraint for distributing the sacks. The final allocation of sacks to siblings is output to `mostenire.out`. This should provide the correct output as per the specified in the expected result.

The result still differs from the expected output because the previous solution does not distribute the sacks in a way that ensures each sibling receives the correct number of sacks with the appropriate sum of gold. The allocation process did not respect the constraint that each younger sibling should not have more gold than an older one.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we allocate the sacks from the eldest to the youngest while maintaining the sum of gold for each sibling correctly. The eldest can receive at most `(total gold - sum of K-1 smallest sacks)/K`, and then we proceed to allocate sacks to the other siblings accordingly.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
# Read input
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Sort the sack values to make distribution easier
sacks.sort()

# Determine the maximum amount of gold that the oldest child can receive
# by ensuring that there would be at least one sack for each of the other children
max_gold_for_oldest = (sum(sacks) - sum(sacks[:K-1])) // K

# Distribute the sacks starting from the oldest child
distribution = []
current_sum = 0
current_kid = 1
sack_count = 0
for sack in sacks:
    if current_kid < K and (current_sum + sack > max_gold_for_oldest or sack_count == N - K + current_kid):
        distribution.append((current_kid, sack_count))
        current_kid += 1
        current_sum = sack
        sack_count = 1
    else:
        current_sum += sack
        sack_count += 1
distribution.append((current_kid, sack_count))  # Allocate remaining sacks to the youngest

# Write output
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    gold_for_youngest = sum(sacks[-distribution[-1][1]:])
    file.write(f"{gold_for_youngest}\n")
    for sibling_number, num_sacks in distribution:
        file.write(f"{sibling_number} {num_sacks}\n")
```

This solution takes a different approach by pre-sorting the sacks, computing the maximum amount of gold the oldest sibling could get, and then distributing the sacks while enforcing the constraints. It writes the result to `mostenire.out` and should now match the expected output.

The previously proposed solutions still do not solve the problem correctly. The main issue appears to be in ensuring that the youngest sibling receives the maximum possible sum of gold while also ensuring that each older sibling does not receive less gold than the younger ones.

The expected output suggests that the youngest sibling should receive the last four sacks (with 5, 6, 7, and 8 gold pieces, respectively), totaling 26 gold, while the oldest sibling should receive the first two sacks and the second sibling the next two sacks.

To implement a solution that correctly follows the problem constraints, I will try a different approach. Since the youngest should receive the maximum possible sum, and we know that every brother must receive at least one sack, we can iterate over the possible sums for the youngest brother in decreasing order and try to distribute the rest to the other brothers, ensuring no brother receives less than the brother before him (younger brothers).

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Sort sacks to simplify finding the max sum for the youngest
sacks.sort()

def distribute_sacks(K, sacks):
    for start in range(N-K+1):
        # Sum for youngest brother is the sum of the last K-start sacks
        sum_for_youngest = sum(sacks[-(K-start):])

        # Sums for other brothers initialized to 0
        sums = [0] * (K-1)

        # Distribute remaining sacks to other brothers
        remaining = list(reversed(sacks[:N-K+start]))
        valid = True
        for i in range(K-2, -1, -1):
            while sums[i] < sum_for_youngest and remaining:
                sums[i] += remaining.pop()
            if i > 0 and sums[i] <= sums[i-1]:
                valid = False
                break

        if valid and not remaining:
            # Found valid distribution
            result = [0] * K
            result[K-1] = len(sacks) - (N-K+start)
            previous = N-K+start
            for i in range(K-2, -1, -1):
                result[i] = previous - (N-K+start - sum(sacks[:previous]) // sum_for_youngest)
                previous -= result[i]
            return sum_for_youngest, result
    return 0, []

# Distribute and get the result
max_sum_for_youngest, distribution = distribute_sacks(K, sacks)

# Write output
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_sum_for_youngest}\n")
    for i in range(K):
        file.write(f"{i+1} {distribution[i]}\n")
```

This implementation tries to find a maximum sum for the youngest sibling starting from the end of the sorted sacks list and checks if the remaining sacks can be distributed among the other siblings without violating the constraints. Once a valid distribution is found, it writes the results to `mostenire.out`. This should now correctly solve the problem and produce the expected output.

The output is incorrect because the algorithm does not properly allocate the sacks to the siblings according to the rules: each sibling must receive at least one sack, and no younger sibling should receive more gold than an older one.

To correct the solution, we will implement an algorithm that starts by finding the maximum sum for the youngest sibling that does not exceed the total sum divided by the number of siblings (K). We then work backwards to allocate sacks to each sibling. Note that we should consider the cases where the sum for the youngest can be increased by giving more sacks to older siblings while still respecting the rule.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# We define a function to find the maximum sum for the youngest sibling.
def find_max_sum_for_youngest(sacks, K):
    # Reverse the sack list to start allocation from the largest values.
    sacks = sacks[::-1]
    # Start with the maximum possible sum for the youngest.
    max_sum = sum(sacks) // K
    # Calculate sums for each sibling starting with the youngest.
    sums = [0] * K
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(K):
            # Allocate the sack to the j-th sibling if possible.
            if sums[j] + sacks[i] <= max_sum or j == K - 1:
                sums[j] += sacks[i]
                break
    return min(sums)

# Read input
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Find the maximum sum for the youngest sibling.
max_sum_for_youngest = find_max_sum_for_youngest(sacks, K)

# Allocate the sacks following the previously computed maximum sum.
sacks = sacks[::-1]  # Reverse back to original order for allocation.
allocation = [0] * K
current_sum = 0
for sack in sacks:
    for i in range(K):
        if current_sum + sack <= max_sum_for_youngest and allocation[i] < N - K + i + 1:
            allocation[i] += 1
            current_sum += sack
            break
    else:
        current_sum = sack
        allocation[K - 1] += 1

# Write output
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_sum_for_youngest}\n")
    for i in range(K-1, -1, -1):
        file.write(f"{K-i} {allocation[i]}\n")
```

The main idea of this solution is to allocate the sacks in such a way that the youngest sibling receives the maximum sum of gold possible while still following the rule of not receiving more than the older siblings. This solution maintains a running sum of the gold allocated to each sibling and writes the final allocation to `mostenire.out`.
