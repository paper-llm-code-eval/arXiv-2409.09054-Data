Împăratul cel bătrân vrea să împartă sacii cu galbeni din vistieria palatului celor $K$ feciori ai săi, numerotați de la $1$ la $K$ în ordinea vârstei. Feciorul cu numărul $1$ este cel mai mare, iar mezinul are numărul $K$.

În vistierie sunt $N$ saci plini cu galbeni, așezați în linie, atât de grei încât nu li se poate schimba ordinea, iar pe fiecare sac este scris numărul de galbeni pe care îi conține.
\
Împăratul îl cheamă pe unul dintre feciori și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_1$ saci!”. Feciorul ia sacii și pleacă fericit. Apoi, împăratul cheamă alt fecior și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_2$ saci dintre cei rămași!”. Și așa mai departe, până ajunge la ultimul fecior chemat, căruia îi dă toți sacii rămași.

El nu are o ordine anume în care își cheamă feciorii dar are grijă să cheme fiecare fecior exact o dată. Totodată, pentru a evita certurile între ei, este atent ca fiecare fecior să primească cel puțin un sac cu galbeni, dar **să NU primească în total mai mulți galbeni ca un frate mai mare decât el**. Cel mai mic dintre feciorii împăratului este și cel mai viteaz, așa că împăratul ar vrea să îi dea lui o sumă de bani cât mai mare, fără a-i supăra pe ceilalți feciori ai săi.

# Cerință
Cum ar putea împărți împăratul sacii?

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mostenire.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $K$, separate de un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural, reprezentând numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac, în ordinea în care aceștia urmează să fie distribuiți fiilor.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `mostenire.out` va conține pe prima linie suma de galbeni pe care o va primi fiul cel mic de la împărat. Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al feciorului, respectiv numărul de saci $x_i$ pe care îi primește acesta, în ordinea în care au fost chemați de împărat.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq K \leq 100$
- $K \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac va fi între $1$ și $100\ 000$.
- Galbenii din oricare dintre saci nu pot fi împărțiți mai multor frați.
- Numărul total de galbeni aflați în vistierie este mai mic sau egal cu $10^9$.
- Împăratul cel bătrân nu are doi feciori cu aceeași vârstă.
- **Puteți afișa orice soluție în care mezinul primește numărul maxim posibil de galbeni**.
- Pentru fiecare test, afișarea corectă a numărului maxim de galbeni primiți de mezin este notată cu $40\%$ din punctajul alocat testului.
- Pentru teste valorând 10 puncte, $N = K$ și $N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste valorând 30 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 15$.
- Pentru teste valorând 50 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 100$.

    min_gold = total_gold // K

    # Initialize the allocation of sacks to sons
    allocation = [0] * K
    current_sum = 0
    son_index = K - 1
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        if current_sum + sacks[i] > min_gold and son_index > 0:
            # Move to the next son if the current allocation exceeds the minimum
            son_index -= 1
            current_sum = 0
        current_sum += sacks[i]
        allocation[son_index] += 1

    # The sum for the youngest son is the sum of sacks from allocation[0] to allocation[K-1]
    youngest_sum = sum(sacks[:allocation[K - 1]])

    return youngest_sum, allocation

# Read data from file

    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

    for i in range(K):
        file.write(f'{i+1} {allocation[i]}\n')
        current_sack += allocation[i]
```

This solution first computes the maximum gold the youngest son can get by ensuring each son gets at least an equal share, then greedily allocates the sacks from the end to fulfill the condition that no younger son gets more gold than an older son. The allocation list tracks how many sacks each son gets, and the final output is written to `mostenire.out`.

The initial solution incorrectly defined the minimum amount of gold each son should receive and did not correctly allocate the sacks according to the given rules. The greedy approach was not the correct way to ensure the youngest son gets the maximum amount of gold.

The correct approach should start by allocating at least one sack to each son, starting from the youngest, and then allocate the remaining sacks in a way that maximizes the youngest son's share without allowing any younger son to have more gold than an older son.

Let's correct the implementation:

```python
def allocate_sacks(N, K, sacks):
    # Reverse sort the sacks to allocate the largest ones to the youngest son
    sacks_sorted = sorted(sacks, reverse=True)

    # Initialize allocation with one sack per son
    allocation = [1] * K
    gold_allocated = [sacks_sorted[i] for i in range(K)]
    remaining_sacks = N - K

    # Allocate remaining sacks starting from the youngest son
    for i in range(remaining_sacks):
        # Find which son should get the next sack
        min_gold = min(gold_allocated[:-1])  # Exclude the youngest son
        youngest_son_index = gold_allocated.index(min_gold) + 1
        # Allocate the next largest sack to the selected son
        allocation[youngest_son_index] += 1
        gold_allocated[youngest_son_index] += sacks_sorted[K + i]

    # Calculate the total gold for the youngest son
    youngest_gold = gold_allocated[-1]

    # Construct the order of allocation
    order = [(K - i, allocation[i]) for i in range(K - 1, -1, -1)]

    return youngest_gold, order

# Read data from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate distribution
youngest_gold, order = allocate_sacks(N, K, sacks)

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{youngest_gold}\n')
    for son_number, sack_count in order:
        file.write(f'{son_number} {sack_count}\n')
```

This implementation ensures that each son gets at least one sack, starting with the youngest. It then proceeds to allocate the remaining sacks by always giving the next largest sack to the son whose current total gold is closest to the gold of the youngest son, excluding the youngest son himself. This way, the youngest son's share is maximized while respecting the rule that no younger son may get more gold than an older son.

The previous solution does not address the requirement that each son must receive fewer or equal gold coins than the older son, and the youngest son must receive the maximum possible amount of gold. Additionally, the code incorrectly reverses the sack allocation order.

The issue is the algorithm's logic. We need to adjust the approach. The proper algorithm should start by finding the maximum amount each son can receive, subject to the constraints, then distribute the sacks starting from the oldest to the youngest, ensuring that no younger son receives more than an older one.

Let's implement a correct solution:

```python
def allocate_sacks(N, K, sacks):
    # Reverse the list so we can pop the sacks from the end (which is the original start)
    sacks.reverse()
    
    # Find the maximum sum the youngest can get
    dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, K) + 1):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], (dp[i - j][j - 1] if i >= j else 0) + sum(sacks[i - j:i]))
    
    max_sum_for_youngest = dp[N][K]
    
    # Deduce the allocation from the dp array
    allocation = []
    n, k = N, K
    while k > 0:
        if dp[n][k] == dp[n - 1][k]:
            n -= 1
        else:
            allocation.append(k)
            n -= k
            k -= 1
    
    # Reverse the allocation to match the sons' order
    allocation.reverse()
    
    # Calculate the amount of gold for each son
    starting_sack = 0
    gold_for_each_son = []
    for alloc in allocation:
        gold_for_each_son.append((starting_sack + 1, starting_sack + alloc))
        starting_sack += alloc
    
    return max_sum_for_youngest, gold_for_each_son

# Read data from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate distribution
max_sum_for_youngest, gold_for_each_son = allocate_sacks(N, K, sacks)

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_sum_for_youngest}\n')
    for son_number, (start, end) in zip(range(1, K + 1), gold_for_each_son):
        file.write(f'{son_number} {end - start + 1}\n')
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the most gold the youngest son can get. The `dp` array stores the maximum sum that can be achieved with `i` sacks and `j` sons. After finding the max sum for the youngest, we reconstruct the allocation by iterating backward through the `dp` array. Finally, we write the allocation to the output file, ensuring the order of sons and the count of sacks each son receives match the input order.

The previous solution's dynamic programming approach is not properly tailored to the problem statement, leading to incorrect allocation of the sacks. The core issue in the logic lies in how the allocation is determined and how the maximum sum for the youngest son is calculated.

To fix this, we need a different strategy that ensures the youngest son (son K) gets the maximum possible amount of gold, while every son receives less or equal gold compared to an older son. One approach is to first determine the maximum amount the youngest son can have by starting with the maximum possible (the sum of all sacks divided by K) and then trying to distribute sacks from the end in a way that does not violate the conditions.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def distribute_gold(N, K, sacks):
    # Binary search to find the maximum amount that can be given to the youngest son
    left, right = 0, sum(sacks) // K
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2  # Try a higher amount
        count, total = 1, 0
        for i in reversed(sacks):
            if total + i <= mid:
                total += i
            else:
                total = i
                count += 1
            if count > K:  # Too many splits, need less gold per son
                break
        if count <= K:
            left = mid  # Possible to give 'mid' gold to the youngest son
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Not possible, try less gold

    # Now 'left' is the maximum amount the youngest son can have
    youngest_gold = left
    
    # Distribute the sacks from the end and count them
    allocation = [0] * K
    total, son = 0, K - 1
    for i in reversed(sacks):
        if total + i > youngest_gold:
            son -= 1
            total = 0
        total += i
        allocation[son] += 1

    return youngest_gold, allocation[::-1]

# Read data from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate distribution
youngest_gold, allocation = distribute_gold(N, K, sacks)

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{youngest_gold}\n')
    sack_index = 0
    for son_number, sacks_count in zip(range(1, K + 1), allocation):
        file.write(f'{son_number} {sacks_count}\n')
        sack_index += sacks_count
```

This corrected solution performs a binary search to find the maximum amount of gold that can be allocated to the youngest son without violating the constraints. Once this amount is determined, we distribute the sacks from the end, ensuring no younger son receives more than an older son. The allocation is then written to the output file in the correct order.

The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the program is trying to access an index in the `allocation` list that does not exist. This error can occur if the variable `son` becomes less than 0.

This issue is due to the fact that we're decrementing the `son` variable whenever we find a sack that, if added to the current total, would exceed the `youngest_gold` amount. However, we're not making sure `son` does not go below 0.

We will fix this issue by stopping the loop and distributing the remaining sacks to the remaining sons in reverse order (ensuring each son receives at least one sack), starting with the youngest. We also need to ensure that the algorithm correctly distributes the exact number of sacks based on the determined maximum amount the youngest son can have.

Let's revise the solution:

```python
def distribute_gold(N, K, sacks):
    def is_possible(mid):
        count, total = 0, 0
        for i in reversed(sacks):
            if total + i <= mid:
                total += i
            else:
                total = i
                count += 1
        return count < K  # Must be strictly less because the youngest son will always get a portion

    # Binary search to find the right amount for the youngest son
    left, right = 1, sum(sacks)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if is_possible(mid):
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    # Now 'left' contains the max possible amount for the youngest son
    youngest_gold = left

    # Distribute sacks to sons, starting from the youngest
    allocation = [0] * K
    total, son = 0, K - 1
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        if total + sacks[i] <= youngest_gold and son > 0:
            total += sacks[i]
        else:
            allocation[son] = N - i - sum(allocation)
            son -= 1
            total = sacks[i]

    # The last son (the youngest) gets the remaining sacks
    allocation[K - 1] = N - sum(allocation)

    return youngest_gold, allocation

# Read data from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate distribution
youngest_gold, allocation = distribute_gold(N, K, sacks)

# Write output to file

    for son_number, sacks_count in zip(range(K, 0, -1), allocation):

```

This revised solution uses a binary search to find the maximum amount of gold that can be allocated to the youngest son. It also ensures that the sacks are distributed according to the constraints. The allocation is then written to the output file with the son numbers in descending order as required.

The found output does not match the expected output because the logic for allocating the sacks to the sons is flawed. In the currently written solution, all the sacks are being assigned to the oldest son rather than being distributed appropriately among all sons.

The problem requires that each son receives at least one sack and that no younger son receives more sacks than an older son, with the youngest son receiving as many galbeni as possible.

To correct the issue, we can use a greedy approach that starts by giving one sack to each son from the oldest to the youngest. Then we distribute the remaining sacks starting from the youngest son, ensuring that we do not violate the rule that each son must receive fewer or equal galbeni than an older son.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def max_gold_for_youngest(N, K, sacks):
    # Sort the sacks to distribute the largest ones first
    sorted_sacks = sorted(sacks, reverse=True)

    # Distribute one sack to each son, starting from the oldest
    distributed = [0] * K
    for i in range(K):
        distributed[i] = sorted_sacks.pop(0)
    
    # Distribute the remaining sacks starting from the youngest
    # while maintaining the constraints
    for sack in sorted_sacks:
        for i in range(K - 1, -1, -1):  # Start from the youngest
            if i == K - 1 or distributed[i + 1] - distributed[i] >= sack:
                distributed[i] += sack
                break
    
    # The youngest son is now the last in the distributed list
    return distributed[-1], distributed

# Read data from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate the maximum gold the youngest son can receive
youngest_gold, distributed = max_gold_for_youngest(N, K, sacks)

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{youngest_gold}\n')
    sack_counter = 0
    for son_number, gold in enumerate(distributed, start=1):
        sacks_for_son = gold - sack_counter
        sack_counter = gold
        file.write(f'{son_number} {sacks_for_son}\n')
```

This solution starts by distributing the largest sacks first and ensures that each son gets at least one sack. The remaining sacks are then distributed in such a way that the youngest son receives the largest possible amount, without any younger son getting more than an older one. The results are then correctly output to the file.

The found output is incorrect because the solution did not correctly allocate the sacks based on the rules. It incorrectly calculated negative sack counts for the second son and did not distribute the sacks in such a way that the youngest son gets the maximum possible amount while no younger son receives more galbeni than an older son.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct approach. To ensure that each son gets fewer or equal sacks compared to an older son, we need to distribute the sacks by first allocating one sack to each son, and then distribute the remaining sacks starting from the youngest to the oldest without violating the constraints.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Read data from file

    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Sort the sacks to distribute the largest ones first
sacks.sort()

# Distribute one sack to each son
distribution = [1] * K
remaining_sacks = N - K # Remaining sacks after giving one to each son

# Track the total gold each son has received
gold = [sacks[i] for i in range(K)]

while remaining_sacks > 0:
    for i in range(K - 1, -1, -1): # Start from the youngest son
        # Check if this son can receive more sacks without breaking the rule
        if i == K - 1 or gold[i] <= gold[i - 1]:
            gold[i] += sacks[K - 1 + remaining_sacks]
            distribution[i] += 1
            remaining_sacks -= 1
        if remaining_sacks == 0:
            break

        file.write(f'{K + 1 - son_number} {sacks_count}\n')
```

This solution allocates the sacks starting from the largest ones and ensures every son gets at least one sack. The youngest son is given priority when distributing the remaining sacks. We then write the allocated number of sacks to each son to the output file in the correct order, starting with the youngest son.
