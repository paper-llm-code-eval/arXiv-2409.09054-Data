Împăratul cel bătrân vrea să împartă sacii cu galbeni din vistieria palatului celor $K$ feciori ai săi, numerotați de la $1$ la $K$ în ordinea vârstei. Feciorul cu numărul $1$ este cel mai mare, iar mezinul are numărul $K$.

În vistierie sunt $N$ saci plini cu galbeni, așezați în linie, atât de grei încât nu li se poate schimba ordinea, iar pe fiecare sac este scris numărul de galbeni pe care îi conține.
\
Împăratul îl cheamă pe unul dintre feciori și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_1$ saci!”. Feciorul ia sacii și pleacă fericit. Apoi, împăratul cheamă alt fecior și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_2$ saci dintre cei rămași!”. Și așa mai departe, până ajunge la ultimul fecior chemat, căruia îi dă toți sacii rămași.

El nu are o ordine anume în care își cheamă feciorii dar are grijă să cheme fiecare fecior exact o dată. Totodată, pentru a evita certurile între ei, este atent ca fiecare fecior să primească cel puțin un sac cu galbeni, dar **să NU primească în total mai mulți galbeni ca un frate mai mare decât el**. Cel mai mic dintre feciorii împăratului este și cel mai viteaz, așa că împăratul ar vrea să îi dea lui o sumă de bani cât mai mare, fără a-i supăra pe ceilalți feciori ai săi.

# Cerință
Cum ar putea împărți împăratul sacii?

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mostenire.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $K$, separate de un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural, reprezentând numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac, în ordinea în care aceștia urmează să fie distribuiți fiilor.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `mostenire.out` va conține pe prima linie suma de galbeni pe care o va primi fiul cel mic de la împărat. Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al feciorului, respectiv numărul de saci $x_i$ pe care îi primește acesta, în ordinea în care au fost chemați de împărat.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq K \leq 100$
- $K \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac va fi între $1$ și $100\ 000$.
- Galbenii din oricare dintre saci nu pot fi împărțiți mai multor frați.
- Numărul total de galbeni aflați în vistierie este mai mic sau egal cu $10^9$.
- Împăratul cel bătrân nu are doi feciori cu aceeași vârstă.
- **Puteți afișa orice soluție în care mezinul primește numărul maxim posibil de galbeni**.
- Pentru fiecare test, afișarea corectă a numărului maxim de galbeni primiți de mezin este notată cu $40\%$ din punctajul alocat testului.
- Pentru teste valorând 10 puncte, $N = K$ și $N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste valorând 30 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 15$.
- Pentru teste valorând 50 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 100$.

# Read input data
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, K = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Algorithm to distribute the sacks
def distribute_sacks(sacks, K):
    dp = [[0] * (K+1) for _ in range(len(sacks) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(sacks) + 1):
        dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][1] + sacks[i-1]

    for i in range(2, len(sacks) + 1):
        for j in range(2, min(i, K) + 1):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], min(dp[k][j-1] for k in range(j-1, i)))

    # Retrieve solution
    answer = [0] * K
    total_sacks = N
    for i in range(K, 0, -1):
        current_sum = 0
        for j in range(total_sacks, 0, -1):
            if dp[j][i] < dp[total_sacks][i]:
                break
            current_sum += sacks[j-1]
        answer[i-1] = total_sacks - j
        total_sacks = j

    youngest_sum = sum(sacks[-answer[-1]:])

    return youngest_sum, answer

# Solve the problem
youngest_sum, answer = distribute_sacks(sacks, K)

# Write output data
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{youngest_sum}\n")
    total_sacks = N
    for i, x in enumerate(answer):
        fout.write(f"{K-i} {x}\n")
        total_sacks -= x
```

The code starts by reading the input from the file `mostenire.in`. It then defines and uses a function `distribute_sacks` that implements a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of gold coins the youngest son can receive, and how to distribute the sacks among all sons. Finally, the code writes the result to the file `mostenire.out`. The dynamic programming table `dp` is constructed in such a way that `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of gold coins that the `j`-th son can receive from the first `i` sacks. By backtracking from `dp[N][K]`, we can reconstruct the distribution of sacks among the sons.

The initial solution proposed has a mistake in how it calculates the dynamic programming table and in the backtracking process for the solution reconstruction. The dynamic programming approach should ensure that each child gets fewer sacks than their elder siblings and that the youngest son gets as many coins as possible.

Here's a corrected approach and solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, K = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Reverse the list to start allocating from the youngest son
sacks.reverse()

# Calculate prefix sums to speed up sum queries
prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + sacks[i - 1]

# Find the maximum amount the youngest can have
def find_max_for_youngest(N, K, prefix_sums):
    left, right, max_youngest = 0, prefix_sums[N] // K, 0
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        count, current_sum = 1, 0
        valid = True
        for i in range(N):
            current_sum += sacks[i]
            if current_sum > mid:
                count += 1
                current_sum = sacks[i]
                if count > K:
                    valid = False
                    break
        if valid:
            max_youngest = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return max_youngest

max_for_youngest = find_max_for_youngest(N, K, prefix_sums)

# Distribute sacks based on the maximum amount for the youngest
allocation = []
current_sum, sacks_given = 0, 0
for i in range(N):
    if current_sum + sacks[i] > max_for_youngest and sacks_given < K - 1:
        allocation.append(i - sacks_given)
        sacks_given += 1
        current_sum = 0
    current_sum += sacks[i]

# Add the remaining sacks for the last child
allocation.append(N - sum(allocation))

# Write output data
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{max_for_youngest}\n")
    for i in range(K - 1, -1, -1):
        fout.write(f"{K - i} {allocation[i]}\n")
```

This corrected solution starts by reading the input data and calculating the prefix sums for the sacks. Then, it applies binary search to find the maximum amount the youngest son could receive without having more than an older brother. After finding this maximum, it distributes the sacks accordingly, ensuring that each son receives a certain number of sacks according to their order of inheritance, and the youngest son receives as much as possible but not more than his elders. Finally, it writes the distribution to the output file.

The main differences from the initial solution are:

1. The initial solution tried to use dynamic programming but didn't enforce the rule that each son should receive fewer sacks than their elder siblings.
2. The corrected solution uses binary search to find the maximum amount for the youngest son and then distributes the sacks accordingly.
3. The output now correctly reflects the distribution of sacks, satisfying the problem's constraints.

I apologize for the confusion with the previous solutions. The problem statement requires a distribution of sacks where no younger sibling receives more gold than an elder one, with the youngest sibling receiving as much as possible.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to try allocating the sacks from the youngest to the oldest, ensuring that each allocation is at least as much as the previous one (i.e., the one given to a younger sibling). This will maximize the amount the youngest can receive.

Let's re-implement the solution using a different approach:

```python
# Read input data
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, K = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate the maximum amount the youngest can get
def max_for_youngest(N, K, sacks):
    # Initialize left and right boundaries for binary search
    left, right = 0, sum(sacks)
    youngest_max = 0

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Middle point (possible max for the youngest)
        count, current_sum = 1, 0  # Counter for children, current sum
        
        for i in range(N):
            # If adding current sack exceeds the trial sum, move to the next child
            if current_sum + sacks[i] > mid:
                count += 1
                current_sum = 0
                
            current_sum += sacks[i]
            
            # If more children than available or the last child cannot get the trial sum
            if count > K or (i == N - 1 and current_sum < mid):
                left = mid + 1
                break
        else:
            # Possible solution found, try with a smaller maximum
            youngest_max = mid
            right = mid - 1

    return youngest_max

# Find the maximum amount the youngest can get
youngest_max = max_for_youngest(N, K, sacks)

# Distribute sacks from youngest to oldest
def distribute_sacks(N, K, sacks, youngest_max):
    allocations = []
    remaining_sacks = N
    for i in range(K, 0, -1):
        current_sum, num_sacks = 0, 0
        while remaining_sacks > 0 and (current_sum + sacks[remaining_sacks - 1] <= youngest_max or i == 1):
            current_sum += sacks[remaining_sacks - 1]
            num_sacks += 1
            remaining_sacks -= 1

        # Ensure the next elder sibling gets at least as much as the current one
        youngest_max = current_sum
        allocations.append((i, num_sacks))

    return allocations[::-1]  # Reverse to get the correct order

# Allocate sacks and write to output file
allocations = distribute_sacks(N, K, sacks, youngest_max)
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{youngest_max}\n")
    for allocation in allocations:
        fout.write(f"{allocation[0]} {allocation[1]}\n")
```

The re-implemented solution performs a binary search to find the maximum amount the youngest sibling can receive, ensuring the distribution is fair. Then it distributes the sacks according to that maximum, starting from the youngest sibling and making sure that no older sibling gets less than their younger ones. Finally, the solution writes the results to the file `mostenire.out` in the required format.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not adequately enforce the conditions for distributing the sacks, specifically that each child must receive at least one sack, and the distribution should ensure that older siblings do not receive less than the younger ones.

Let's re-implement the solution with a correct approach:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate the cumulative sum to use in binary search
cumulative_sum = [0]
for sack in sacks:
    cumulative_sum.append(cumulative_sum[-1] + sack)

# Find the maximum amount the youngest can get using binary search
def valid(amount, K, cumulative_sum):
    count = 0
    last = 0
    for i in range(1, len(cumulative_sum)):
        if cumulative_sum[i] - cumulative_sum[last] > amount:
            count += 1
            last = i - 1
            if cumulative_sum[i] - cumulative_sum[last] > amount:
                return False
    count += 1
    return count <= K

def binary_search(K, cumulative_sum):
    low, high = 0, cumulative_sum[-1]
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if valid(mid, K, cumulative_sum):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return low

max_for_youngest = binary_search(K, cumulative_sum)

# Distribute sacks starting from the youngest
def distribute(K, cumulative_sum, max_for_youngest):
    children = [0] * K
    child = K - 1
    last_sack = N
    while child >= 0:
        first_sack = last_sack
        while first_sack > 0 and cumulative_sum[last_sack] - cumulative_sum[first_sack - 1] <= max_for_youngest:
            first_sack -= 1
        children[child] = (last_sack - first_sack)
        last_sack = first_sack
        child -= 1
    return children

# Write the output data
distribution = distribute(K, cumulative_sum, max_for_youngest)
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_for_youngest}\n')
    for i, sacks in enumerate(distribution[::-1], 1):
        file.write(f'{i} {sacks}\n')
```

This solution performs a binary search to find the maximum amount of gold the youngest child can get. The binary search is used to find the smallest possible highest sum while still being able to distribute the sacks to all K children under the condition that each child gets at least one sack and no child gets more than any elder sibling.

Within the binary search, a validity check ensures that the current amount can be distributed correctly among the children. Once the correct amount is found, distribution calculates the actual number of sacks each child will receive, starting from the youngest to the oldest.

Finally, the output, including the maximum sum received by the youngest and the distribution of sacks, is written to 'mostenire.out'.

The provided outputs indicate that the previous solutions failed to correctly enforce the distribution constraints. Specifically, they did not ensure that every sibling receives at least one sack and that no younger sibling receives more gold than an older one, while still maximizing the youngest sibling's inheritance. Additionally, the order of sibling distribution must be maintained to match the expected output.

Let's implement a solution that respects these constraints:

```python
def distribute_sacks(N, K, sacks):
    # Perform binary search to find the minimum possible value for the youngest son
    # that still allows all other siblings to get at least that much.
    lo, hi = 0, 10**9
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi + 1) // 2
        cnt, current_sum = 1, 0
        for i in range(N):
            if current_sum + sacks[i] > mid:
                cnt += 1
                current_sum = 0
            current_sum += sacks[i]
        if cnt <= K:
            lo = mid
        else:
            hi = mid - 1

    # Allocate the sacks based on the binary search result
    youngest_value = lo
    allocation = [0] * K
    remaining_kids = K
    current_sum = 0

    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        if current_sum + sacks[i] > youngest_value or remaining_kids == i + 1:
            allocation[remaining_kids - 1] = N - 1 - i
            N = i + 1
            remaining_kids -= 1
            current_sum = 0
        current_sum += sacks[i]
    allocation[0] = N  # Allocate remaining sacks to the eldest child

    return youngest_value, allocation

with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, K = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

youngest_value, allocation = distribute_sacks(N, K, sacks)

with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write("{}\n".format(youngest_value))
    for i in range(K):
        fout.write("{} {}\n".format(K - i, allocation[K - i - 1]))
```

This solution first performs a binary search to find the maximum number of gold coins that can be allocated to the youngest sibling while still allowing for a fair distribution according to the rules. It searches for the minimum value that allows all siblings to receive at least as many gold coins as the youngest.

Once the correct value is found, it proceeds to actually distribute the sacks by iterating from the end of the list (to ensure the youngest sibling gets their share first) and making sure not to exceed the determined value for any sibling.

Finally, the solution writes the number of gold coins for the youngest sibling and the distribution of sacks for each sibling to the output file `mostenire.out` in the required format.

This implementation should follow the rules and produce the expected output for the given input.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's re-evaluate the solution and rewrite it with the necessary fixes.

To solve the problem, we should start by determining the maximum amount of gold the youngest child can inherit while ensuring that each sibling receives at least one sack and that no younger sibling receives more gold than an older one.

We can solve this problem using a greedy approach. We iterate from the eldest son to the youngest. For each son, we allocate as many sacks as possible, starting with the constraint that the eldest son receives at least one sack, and each subsequent son receives no more than the previous one.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Find the maximum number of gold coins the youngest child can inherit
def find_max_gold(N, K, sacks):
    # Initialize low and high for binary search on the answer
    low, high = 1, sum(sacks)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        # Allocate sacks starting from the oldest to the youngest
        count, current_sum = 0, 0
        for i in range(N):
            if count == K - 1 or current_sum + sacks[i] <= mid:
                current_sum += sacks[i]
            else:
                current_sum = sacks[i]
                count += 1
        if count < K:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return low

# Distribute the sacks to the children
def distribute_sacks(N, K, sacks, max_gold):
    allocation = [0] * K
    current_sum = 0
    child = 0  # Start with the oldest child
    for i in range(N):
        if child < K - 1 and (current_sum + sacks[i] > max_gold or 
                               allocation[child] + sum(allocation[child+1:]) == N - i - 1):
            child += 1
            current_sum = 0
        allocation[child] += 1
        current_sum += sacks[i]

    # allocation now represents the number of sacks per child from oldest to youngest
    return allocation

# Find the maximum gold for the youngest

        file.write(f"{i + 1} {allocation[i]}\n")
```

The `find_max_gold` function performs a binary search to find the maximum number of gold coins that the youngest can inherit. We use the `distribute_sacks` function to distribute the sacks according to that maximum number of gold coins for the youngest. We ensure that each child receives at least one sack and that no younger sibling gets more gold than the elder ones.

The output file `mostenire.out` will contain the maximum number of gold coins the youngest can inherit followed by the distribution of sacks to each child in the order they were called by the emperor.

This code should now correctly distribute the sacks according to the problem's constraints and produce the expected output for the given input.

The expected output indicates that the youngest son should receive the largest possible sum of gold coins, which is 10 in this case, without getting more than the elder sons. This means we need to revise our approach to ensure that each son receives at least one sack and that the total amount of gold given to the sons is non-increasing from the youngest to the oldest.

To do this, we can work from the youngest to the oldest, always ensuring that the elder son gets at least as much as the younger one, starting with the youngest son receiving as many sacks as possible.

Let's implement the solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, K = map(int, fin.readline().strip().split())
    sacks = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Function to find the maximum amount for the youngest son
def find_maximum_for_youngest(N, K, sacks):
    dp = [0] * (K + 1)
    for i in range(1, K + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + sacks[N - i]

    for i in range(N - K, -1, -1):
        for j in range(K, 0, -1):
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], min(dp[j - 1], dp[j] + sacks[i]))

    return dp[K]

# Function to construct the solution of how the sacks are distributed
def construct_solution(N, K, sacks, max_for_youngest):
    distribution = []
    current_sum = 0
    num_sacks = 0

    # Distribute sacks from the first one to the last
    for i in range(N):
        if current_sum + sacks[i] <= max_for_youngest and num_sacks < K:
            current_sum += sacks[i]
            num_sacks += 1
        else:
            distribution.append((K - num_sacks + 1, num_sacks))
            current_sum = sacks[i]
            num_sacks = 1
        K -= 1

    distribution.append((1, num_sacks))

    return distribution[::-1]

# Calculate the maximum for the youngest son and the distribution
max_for_youngest = find_maximum_for_youngest(N, K, sacks)
distribution = construct_solution(N, K, sacks, max_for_youngest)

# Write the output data
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{max_for_youngest}\n")
    for son_number, sacks_received in distribution:
        fout.write(f"{son_number} {sacks_received}\n")
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum amount of gold the youngest son can receive. Then, it constructs the distribution of sacks based on this maximum value, ensuring each sibling receives at least one sack and the total gold given is non-increasing from the youngest to the oldest. The computed distribution is written to `mostenire.out`.

This implementation should respect the given constraints and produce the expected output for the test case provided.
