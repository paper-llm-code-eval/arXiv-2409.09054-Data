Autorităţile dintr-o zonă de munte intenţionează să stabilească un plan de urgenţă, pentru a reacţiona mai eficient la frecventele calamităţi naturale din zonă. În acest scop au identificat $N$ puncte de interes strategic şi le-au numerotat distinct de la $1$ la $N$. Punctele de interes strategic sunt conectate prin $M$ căi de acces având priorităţi în funcţie de importanţă. Între oricare două puncte de interes strategic există cel mult o cale de acces ce poate fi parcursă în ambele sensuri şi cel puţin un drum (format din una sau mai multe căi de acces) ce le conectează. 

În cazul unei calamităţi unele căi de acces pot fi temporar întrerupte şi astfel între anumite puncte de interes nu mai există legătură. Ca urmare pot rezulta mai multe grupuri de puncte în aşa fel încât între oricare două puncte din acelaşi grup să existe măcar un drum şi între oricare două puncte din grupuri diferite să nu existe drum. 

Autorităţile estimează gravitatea unei calamităţi ca fiind suma priorităţilor căilor de acces distruse de aceasta şi doresc să determine un scenariu de gravitate maximă, în care punctele de interes strategic să fie împărţite într-un număr de $K$ grupuri.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `urgenta.in` are următorul format:
$N\ M\ K$
$i_1 \; j_1 \; p_1 $ – între punctele $i_1$ şi $j_1$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_1$
$i_2 \; j_2 \; p_2 $ – între punctele $i_2$ şi $j_2$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_2$
...
$i_M \; j_M \; p_M $ – între punctele $i_M$ şi $j_M$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_M$

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `urgenta.out` va avea următorul format:
$\text{gravmax}$ – gravitatea maximă
$C$	– numărul de căi de acces întrerupte de calamitate
$k_1 \; h_1$ – între punctele $k_1$ şi $h_1$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
$k_2 \; h_2$ – între punctele $k_2$ şi $h_2$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
...
$k_C \; h_C$ – între punctele $k_C$ şi $h_C$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 \leq N \leq 255$
* $N - 1 \leq M \leq 32 \ 384$
* $1 \leq K \leq N$
* Priorităţile căilor de acces sunt întregi strict pozitivi mai mici decât $256$.
* Un grup de puncte poate conţine între $1$ şi $N$ puncte inclusiv.
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul va determina una singură.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read from "urgenta.in" file
with open("urgenta.in", "r") as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Sorting edges based on their priority in descending order

# Find the K-1 most prioritized edges to remove in order to form K groups
edges_to_remove = edges[:K-1]

# Calculate the maximum severity as the sum of priorities of the removed edges
max_severity = sum([priority for _, _, priority in edges_to_remove])

# Write to "urgenta.out" file
with open("urgenta.out", "w") as file:

    for i, j, _ in edges_to_remove:
        file.write(f"{i} {j}\n")
```

This solution assumes that removing the K-1 highest priority edges will yield the maximum severity while creating exactly K groups. This may not always be the optimal solution for the problem stated, but it follows a greedy approach based on the highest priorities. Depending on the structure of the input graph, more complex algorithms may be necessary to ensure the optimal solution.

The initial approach I provided was incorrect since it only considered breaking the K-1 highest priority edges to form K groups. However, that does not guarantee the maximum severity or the correct number of edges to remove to form exactly K groups. Instead, a more sophisticated approach is required that likely involves finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) and then removing the K-1 highest priority edges from the MST.

To fix the solution, we should instead:
1. Build the graph.
2. Find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of that graph.
3. Sort the edges of the MST in descending order of their priority.
4. Remove the K-1 highest priority edges from the MST.
5. Sum their priorities to find the maximum severity.

This will ensure that we are removing edges in such a way that exactly K groups are formed, and the sum of their priorities is the maximum possible. Here is the updated solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, u):
        if u != self.parent[u]:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u == root_v:
            return False
        if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
            self.parent[root_v] = root_u
        elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
            self.parent[root_u] = root_v
        else:
            self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            self.rank[root_u] += 1
        return True

# Read from "urgenta.in" file
with open("urgenta.in", "r") as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Sort edges based on their priority in ascending order for Kruskal's algorithm
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

# Find the MST using Kruskal's algorithm
uf = UnionFind(N)
mst_edges = []
for u, v, w in edges:
    if uf.union(u - 1, v - 1):
        mst_edges.append((u, v, w))

# Sort the edges of the MST in descending order of their priority
mst_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Remove the K-1 highest priority edges from the MST to form K groups
edges_to_remove = mst_edges[:K-1]
max_severity = sum(w for _, _, w in edges_to_remove)

# Write to "urgenta.out" file
with open("urgenta.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"{max_severity}\n{len(edges_to_remove)}\n")
    for u, v, _ in edges_to_remove:
        file.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

This approach uses Kruskal's algorithm with a union-find data structure to build the MST, and then it selects the K-1 highest priority edges to remove from the MST. The edges are sorted in ascending order initially for Kruskal's algorithm to work correctly. After the MST is built, the edges are sorted in descending order to select the ones to remove that will result in the highest severity. The output is written to "urgenta.out" accordingly.

Upon reevaluating the problem, it's clear that the previous approach of constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST) and then removing the K-1 highest priority edges does not necessarily produce the scenario with the maximum severity. The task is to create a maximum spanning forest (MSF) instead, which is a collection of maximum spanning trees that span each of the K groups.

The correct approach should be:
1. Sort all edges in descending order based on their priority.
2. Use a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to connect nodes until we have exactly K groups.
3. Once we have K groups, each additional edge combined would reduce the number of groups, so we add these edges' priorities to calculate the severity.

Let's rewrite the solution to reflect the correct approach:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = [-1 for _ in range(n)]
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] < 0:
            return x
        self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        x_root = self.find(x)
        y_root = self.find(y)
        if x_root == y_root:
            return False
        if self.parent[x_root] > self.parent[y_root]:
            x_root, y_root = y_root, x_root
        self.parent[x_root] += self.parent[y_root]
        self.parent[y_root] = x_root
        return True

# Read from "urgenta.in" file
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Sort edges in descending order by priority
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Create disjoint sets for each node
uf = UnionFind(N + 1)
removed_edges = []
severity_sum = 0
components = N

# Iterate over edges, trying to combine components
for edge in edges:
    u, v, priority = edge
    if uf.find(u) != uf.find(v):
        if components <= K:  # If we already have K groups, stop uniting them
            removed_edges.append(edge)
            severity_sum += priority
        else:
            uf.union(u, v)
            components -= 1

# Write to "urgenta.out" file
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{severity_sum}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n')
    for u, v, _ in removed_edges:
        file.write(f'{u} {v}\n')

```

This solution will output the maximum severity by selecting edges that, if removed, create exactly K connected components and summing their priorities. The result is written to "urgenta.out".

The provided solution incorrectly maximizes the sum of the edge weights to be removed instead of considering the best way to break the graph into K connected components while maximizing the sum of the weights of the removed edges. It is essential to consider that the priority of the edges to be removed should be maximized while still resulting in exactly K components.

Considering that, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Sort edges based on their priority in descending order.
2. Use a Union-Find data structure to iteratively merge components, starting with the lowest priority edges.
3. Stop merging when we have exactly K components.
4. The remaining edges connecting different components would be the ones to remove, and their sum of weights will give us the maximum severity.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
        self.set_count = n

    def find(self, u):
        if u != self.parent[u]:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u == root_v:
            return False
        if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
            self.parent[root_v] = root_u
        elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
            self.parent[root_u] = root_v
        else:
            self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            self.rank[root_u] += 1
        self.set_count -= 1
        return True

# Read from "urgenta.in" file
with open("urgenta.in", "r") as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Sort edges based on their priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize Union-Find
uf = UnionFind(N)
removed_edges = []
severity_sum = 0

# Iterate over edges and merge components
for u, v, w in edges:
    if uf.set_count <= K:  # If we have K or fewer components, consider removing the edge
        if uf.find(u - 1) != uf.find(v - 1):
            removed_edges.append((u, v, w))
            severity_sum += w
    else:
        uf.union(u - 1, v - 1)

# Write to "urgenta.out" file
with open("urgenta.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"{severity_sum}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for u, v, _ in sorted(removed_edges):
        file.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

In this version, we correctly manage the number of components using the Union-Find data structure and we only consider removing an edge if it will not reduce the number of components below K. We then write the results to "urgenta.out" in sorted order for consistency with the expected output.

The previous solution still did not handle the problem correctly. We need to reconsider the approach. A correct algorithm for this problem would involve finding the K-1 most crucial edges that, when removed, would result in K connected components. This is similar to finding a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) and then removing the K-1 edges with the highest weights from it.

However, since the graph may have more than N-1 edges, we need to adjust this approach. We should:

1. Use Kruskal's algorithm to create a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST).
2. After creating the MST, we sort the edges of the MST in descending order of priority.
3. Pick the K-1 highest-priority edges from the MST to remove. Those edges will separate the MST into K connected components.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(size)]
        self.rank = [0] * size

    def find(self, item):
        if self.parent[item] != item:
            self.parent[item] = self.find(self.parent[item])
        return self.parent[item]

    def union(self, a, b):
        root_a = self.find(a)
        root_b = self.find(b)
        if root_a != root_b:
            if self.rank[root_a] > self.rank[root_b]:
                self.parent[root_b] = root_a
            elif self.rank[root_a] < self.rank[root_b]:
                self.parent[root_a] = root_b
            else:
                self.parent[root_b] = root_a
                self.rank[root_a] += 1
            return True
        return False

# Read the input data
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, M, K = map(int, infile.readline().strip().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in infile]

# Sort edges based on priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda edge: edge[2], reverse=True)
uf = UnionFind(N)
mst_edges = []

# Kruskal's algorithm to find the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST)
for edge in edges:
    u, v, w = edge
    if uf.union(u-1, v-1):
        mst_edges.append(edge)

# Sort the edges of the MST in descending order of priority
mst_edges.sort(key=lambda edge: edge[2], reverse=True)

# Select the K-1 highest-priority edges to remove from the MST
removed_edges = mst_edges[:K-1]
severity_sum = sum(edge[2] for edge in removed_edges)

# Write the output data
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as outfile:

    for u, v, w in removed_edges:
        outfile.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

This solution uses the Union-Find data structure with path compression and union by rank to efficiently construct a Maximum Spanning Tree and then removes the K-1 highest-priority edges to form K components. The sum of the weights of these edges gives the maximum severity. The results are written to the output file in sorted order.

To achieve the expected result, we must find the scenario with the highest gravity where the points of strategic interest are divided into exactly K groups. This is a classic problem of finding the maximum weight sum of edges that, when removed, leaves the graph in exactly K connected components. The algorithm to solve this problem is known as Kruskal's algorithm to find a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) and then remove the K-1 most significant edges (edges with the largest weights) from the MST.

However, the issue with the previous solutions is the misinterpretation of this algorithm. We need to find the Maximum Spanning Tree first and then remove the edges from the MST to form K groups, ensuring we remove edges with the biggest weights to maximize the severity.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, u):
        if u != self.parent[u]:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            elif self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1

# Kruskal's algorithm to find the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST)

By sorting the edges by weight in descending order and using Kruskal's algorithm, we construct the MST from the heaviest edges first. Then, by sorting the edges of the MST again in descending order and taking the top K-1 edges, we ensure that the removed edges are those with the most significant weights, which will yield the scenario of maximum severity. The solution should be written to "urgenta.out" in sorted order.

Upon further inspection, it seems the previous approaches were not correctly solving the described problem. It's important to note that in the expected output, more edges are removed than simply the K-1 highest priority edges. This indicates that the solution should not just find any maximum spanning tree (MST) and remove the K-1 largest edges, but instead, it must find the specific edges which, when removed, leave the graph in exactly K connected components and result in the maximum severity.

Here is a correct approach to the problem:

1. Sort all edges in descending order of priority.
2. Use a disjoint-set data structure (Union-Find) to keep track of connected components.
3. Iterate over the sorted edges, and for each edge, if the connected components of the endpoints can be merged without reducing the number of components below K, merge them; otherwise, mark the edge for removal.
4. The total severity is the sum of the priorities of the marked edges.

Let's rewrite the solution, implementing the correct algorithm:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [0] * size
        self.count = size

    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
                self.rank[root_v] += 1
            self.count -= 1
            return True
        return False

# Read the input data
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, M, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile]

# Sort edges based on priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda edge: edge[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize Union-Find
uf = UnionFind(N)

# List to store the edges removed which contribute to the severity
removed_edges = []

# Iterate over edges
for u, v, priority in edges:
    # If the endpoints are not in the same set, and merging them won't reduce the component count below K,
    # merge the sets; otherwise, the edge is removed, contributing to the severity.
    if uf.find(u - 1) != uf.find(v - 1) and uf.count > K:
        uf.union(u - 1, v - 1)
    else:
        removed_edges.append((u, v, priority))

# Calculate the total severity
severity = sum(priority for _, _, priority in removed_edges)

# Write the output data
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{severity}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for u, v, _ in removed_edges:
        outfile.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

This solution considers the necessity to maintain exactly K isolated components while maximizing the severity. It makes sure to stop merging when the number of components reaches K and adds the edge to the removed list if merging would reduce the number of components below K. The final severity is calculated using the total weight of the removed edges, which is written to the output file "urgenta.out" along with the list of removed edges.
