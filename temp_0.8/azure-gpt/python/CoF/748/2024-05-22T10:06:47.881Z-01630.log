În timpul acţiunii ”Furtuna în deşert” din cauza unei furtuni de nisip, $n$ soldaţi s-au rătăcit de plutoanele lor. După trecerea furtunii se pune problema regrupării acestora pe plutoane. Pentru aceasta se folosesc plăcuţele de identificare pe care soldaţii le poartă la gât. Pe aceste plăcuţe sunt scrise numere care pot identifica fiecare soldat şi plutonul din care acesta face parte. Astfel, soldaţii din acelaşi pluton au numărul de identificare format din aceleaşi cifre, dispuse în altă ordine şi numerele de identificare sunt unice. De exemplu, numerele de identificare $78003433$, $83043073$, $33347008$ indică faptul că cei trei soldaţi care le poartă fac parte din acelaşi pluton.

# Cerinţă
Fiind date cele $n$ numere de pe plăcuţele de identificare, să se regrupeze cei $n$ soldaţi pe plutoane, indicându-se numărul de plutoane găsite (un pluton refăcut trebuie să aibă minimum un soldat), numărul de soldaţi din cel mai numeros pluton, numărul de plutoane care au acest număr maxim de soldaţi precum şi componenţa unui astfel de pluton (cu număr maxim de soldaţi regrupaţi).

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `pluton.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul $n$ de soldaţi recuperaţi, iar pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii câte un număr de identificare a celor $n$ soldaţi.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `pluton.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul de plutoane refăcute.
Linia a doua va conţine numărul de soldaţi din cel mai numeros pluton refăcut.
Linia a treia va conţine numărul de plutoane care au numărul maxim de soldaţi recuperaţi.
Linia a patra va conţine componenţa unui astfel de pluton, cu număr maxim de soldaţi recuperaţi, numerele de identificare ale soldaţilor din componenţă fiind scrise unul după altul separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $0 < n \leq 4\ 000$
- $0 <$ număr de identificare $< 2\ 000\ 000\ 000$
- Deoarece linia a patra conţine numerele de identificare ale soldaţilor **unuia** dintre plutoanele cu un număr maxim de soldaţi, pot exista mai multe soluţii corecte. Se poate alege oricare dintre acestea.
- Se acordă punctaje parţiale astfel: pentru valoarea corectă de pe prima linie se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj; pentru valorile corecte de pe prima şi a doua linie se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj, pentru valorile corecte de pe prima, a doua şi a treia linie se acordă $70\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă punctajul integral aferent testului.

This solution reads from `pluton.in` and writes to `pluton.out`, fulfilling all the challenge requirements. It uses a dictionary to group soldiers by their digit signature, which is a sorted string of the digits of their identification number. It then calculates the maximum size of a platoon and the number of platoons with that size. It outputs the required information, including the composition of one of the largest platoons.

Upon careful examination of the expected output and the found output, I can see that the result differs because the expected output has chosen a different group of soldiers for the largest platoon. Both outputs are technically correct since the problem statement specifies that there may be multiple correct solutions and that any platoon with the maximum number of soldiers can be chosen.

In the given example, there are two platoons with 3 soldiers each:

- One platoon has soldiers with ID numbers 1223, 2213, and 1322. Their digit signature is "1223" after sorting the digits.
- Another platoon has soldiers with ID numbers 123, 321, and 312. Their digit signature is "123" after sorting the digits.

Both platoons have the maximum size of 3 soldiers, and there are 2 such platoons, which is what the output reflects. My solution randomly selected the first platoon it encountered with the maximum size, which happened to be the one with the signature "1223". However, the expected solution is asking for the platoon with the signature "123".

To ensure that the output matches the expected result, we can sort the platoon lists by their soldiers' ID numbers before selecting one of the platoons with the maximum size. This will ensure that we select the platoon whose smallest number comes first lexicographically.

I will adjust the solution to implement this logic:

```python
# Read the input data from pluton.in
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Count the soldiers in each platoon by their identification number's digit signature
platoons = {}
for num in soldiers:
    # Create a digit signature by sorting the digits in the identification number
    signature = ''.join(sorted(num))
    if signature not in platoons:
        platoons[signature] = []
    platoons[signature].append(int(num))

# Sort the soldiers in each platoon
for platoon in platoons.values():
    platoon.sort()

# Find the platoon with the most soldiers and the number of platoons with that number of soldiers
max_size = max(len(platoon) for platoon in platoons.values())
max_platoons = sum(1 for platoon in platoons.values() if len(platoon) == max_size)

# Select the lexicographically first platoon with the most soldiers to output
max_platoon = min((platoon for platoon in platoons.values() if len(platoon) == max_size), key=lambda x: x[0])

# Write the output data to pluton.out
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{len(platoons)}\n')               # Number of platoons
    file.write(f'{max_size}\n')                    # Number of soldiers in the largest platoon
    file.write(f'{max_platoons}\n')                # Number of platoons with the maximum number of soldiers
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_platoon)))    # Composition of one platoon with the maximum number of soldiers
```

This solution takes into account the need for a deterministic selection of the platoon to be outputted. By sorting each platoon and then selecting the lexicographically smallest platoon having the maximum number of soldiers, we ensure that the output will match the expected result in cases where multiple correct solutions exist.

The difference between the expected and found result is due to the order of the soldiers' ID numbers in the output. My solution sorted the soldiers' IDs within the platoon, resulting in the order `123 312 321`, while the expected output does not sort the soldiers' IDs within the platoon and seems to require them in the order they were encountered in the input, `321 312 123`.

To correct this issue, I will modify my solution so that it captures the order of the soldiers as they appear in the input file for each platoon, preserving the original order.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from pluton.in
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Store both the soldier's number and its index to preserve the order
    soldiers = [(int(file.readline().strip()), idx) for idx in range(n)]

# Count the soldiers in each platoon by their identification number's digit signature
platoons = {}
for num, idx in soldiers:
    # Create a digit signature by sorting the digits in the identification number
    signature = ''.join(sorted(str(num)))
    if signature not in platoons:
        platoons[signature] = []
    platoons[signature].append((num, idx))

# Find the platoon with the most soldiers and the number of platoons with that number of soldiers
max_size = 0
max_platoons = []
for platoon in platoons.values():
    size = len(platoon)
    if size > max_size:
        max_size = size
        max_platoons = [platoon]
    elif size == max_size:
        max_platoons.append(platoon)

# Sort the platoons with max soldiers by the index of their first soldier to match the expected output order
max_platoons.sort(key=lambda platoon: platoon[0][1])

# Select the first platoon with the most soldiers to output
max_platoon = max_platoons[0]

# Write the output data to pluton.out
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{len(platoons)}\n')  # Number of platoons
    file.write(f'{max_size}\n')       # Number of soldiers in the largest platoon
    file.write(f'{len(max_platoons)}\n')  # Number of platoons with the maximum number of soldiers
    # Composition of one platoon with the maximum number of soldiers
    file.write(' '.join(str(num) for num, _ in max_platoon))
```

This solution ensures that platoons are sorted based on the index of their first soldier's appearance in the input file, which should match the order of soldiers in the expected output and thus provide the correct result.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to the fact that the solution is selecting the platoon with the lexicographically smallest soldier ID (when sorted by digits) instead of matching the expected output's order of soldier IDs as they appear in the platoon with the maximum number of soldiers.

The expected output requires the platoon to be represented in the order of appearance in the input file, not sorted by the soldier IDs.

To fix this issue, we will keep track of the order in which soldiers appear in the input file and ensure that the platoon output preserves this order. Additionally, we will use the original index positions to find the first platoon with the maximum size based on appearance order rather than ID order. Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from pluton.in
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Count the soldiers in each platoon by their identification number's digit signature
platoons = {}
for num in soldiers:
    # Create a digit signature by sorting the digits in the identification number
    signature = ''.join(sorted(str(num)))
    if signature not in platoons:
        platoons[signature] = []
    platoons[signature].append(num)

# Find the platoon(s) with the most soldiers
max_size = max(len(platoon) for platoon in platoons.values())
max_platoons = [platoon for platoon in platoons.values() if len(platoon) == max_size]

# Select the platoon that appeared first in the input as the one to output
# To do this, we need to identify the platoon whose first soldier's ID appears earliest in the input list
earliest_platoon_index = float('inf')
for platoon in max_platoons:
    first_soldier_index = min(soldiers.index(num) for num in platoon)
    if first_soldier_index < earliest_platoon_index:
        earliest_platoon_index = first_soldier_index
        max_platoon = platoon

# Write the output data to pluton.out
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{len(platoons)}\n')           # Number of platoons
    file.write(f'{max_size}\n')                # Number of soldiers in the largest platoon
    file.write(f'{len(max_platoons)}\n')       # Number of platoons with the maximum number of soldiers
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_platoon)) + '\n')  # Composition of one platoon with the maximum number of soldiers
```

This solution should correctly identify the first platoon with the maximum number of soldiers based on the order of soldier IDs in the input file, and it should maintain the order of soldier IDs within that platoon as they appeared in the input.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output arises from the fact that the solution is not correctly preserving the original order of the soldiers within the largest platoons. The expected output requires that the soldiers within a platoon, having the maximum number of soldiers, should be listed in the order that they appear in the input file.

The solution attempts to sort platoons based on the first appearance of their soldiers' IDs. However, it incorrectly sorts the platoon based on the numeric value of their IDs, leading to the wrong platoon being selected.

To fix this, we need to ensure we preserve the original order of soldiers while creating platoons and select the first platoon in this original order when multiple platoons have the maximum number of soldiers.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read the input data from pluton.in
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Count the soldiers in each platoon by their identification number's digit signature
platoon_signatures = {}
for soldier_id in soldiers:
    # Create a digit signature by sorting the digits in the identification number
    signature = ''.join(sorted(soldier_id))
    if signature not in platoon_signatures:
        platoon_signatures[signature] = []
    platoon_signatures[signature].append(soldier_id)

# Find the platoon with the most soldiers
max_soldiers_count = max(len(platoon) for platoon in platoon_signatures.values())
largest_platoons = [platoon for platoon in platoon_signatures.values() if len(platoon) == max_soldiers_count]

# Among the largest platoons, find the one that appears first based on the original input order
first_largest_platoon = min(largest_platoons, key=lambda platoon: soldiers.index(platoon[0]))

# Write the output data to pluton.out
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(platoon_signatures)}\n")  # Number of platoons
    file.write(f"{max_soldiers_count}\n")       # Number of soldiers in the largest platoon
    file.write(f"{len(largest_platoons)}\n")    # Number of platoons with the maximum number of soldiers
    file.write(" ".join(first_largest_platoon))  # Composition of one platoon with the maximum number of soldiers
```

This revised solution should now correctly identify and output the first platoon with the maximum number of soldiers in the original order as they appeared in the input file.

Let's carefully analyze the issue and correct the solution accordingly. The main problem is to correctly identify the platoon with the maximum number of soldiers and to select the platoon that appears first in the input file while maintaining the order of identification numbers as they appear.

The expected output shows that for platoons with the same maximum number of soldiers, the one whose first soldier's identification number appears earliest in the input list should be chosen. Additionally, within that platoon, the soldiers' identification numbers should be listed in the order they were encountered in the input.

To fix the solution, we must track the order of the soldier's ID numbers as they appear in the input and preserve this order when selecting the platoon to output. We will utilize a dictionary to map sorted digit signatures to a list of tuples containing the soldier's ID and its index in the input.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from pluton.in
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldier_ids = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Create a dictionary to group soldiers by their digit signature
platoons = {}
for index, soldier_id in enumerate(soldier_ids):
    signature = ''.join(sorted(soldier_id))
    if signature not in platoons:
        platoons[signature] = []
    platoons[signature].append((index, soldier_id))

# Determine the size of the largest platoon and find all platoons with that size
largest_size = max(len(platoon) for platoon in platoons.values())
largest_platoons = [platoon for platoon in platoons.values() if len(platoon) == largest_size]

# Sort the largest platoons by the index of their first soldier's appearance in the input
largest_platoons.sort(key=lambda platoon: platoon[0][0])

# Select the first platoon with the largest size
selected_platoon = largest_platoons[0]

# Prepare output data: Number of platoons, largest size, number of largest platoons, and soldier IDs of selected platoon
num_platoons = len(platoons)
num_largest_platoons = len(largest_platoons)
soldier_ids_of_selected_platoon = [soldier_id for index, soldier_id in selected_platoon]

# Write the output data to pluton.out
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_platoons}\n")
    file.write(f"{largest_size}\n")
    file.write(f"{num_largest_platoons}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(soldier_ids_of_selected_platoon) + "\n")
```

This solution should now produce the correct output according to the specifications, selecting the correct platoon and preserving the order of soldier IDs as they appeared in the input file.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to the failure of the solution to select the correct platoon and maintain the original input order of soldier IDs within the platoon. The expected output is choosing a different platoon (with soldier IDs `321`, `312`, `123`) than the one my solution is selecting (`1223`, `2213`, `1322`), which means that my solution is not correctly identifying platoons based on their digit signatures.

The digit signature is, in fact, a sorted string of the digits in the soldier's ID number. Soldiers belonging to the same platoon will have the same digit signature when the digits of their ID numbers are sorted.

The solution must group soldiers by their digit signatures, determine the most populous platoon, and then from the platoons with the maximum number of soldiers, choose the platoon that appeared first in the input. Finally, the solution must list the soldiers' IDs from the chosen platoon in the order they appeared in the input.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from pluton.in
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldier_ids = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Group soldiers by their digit signature
platoons = {}
for soldier_id in soldier_ids:
    signature = ''.join(sorted(soldier_id))
    if signature not in platoons:
        platoons[signature] = []
    platoons[signature].append(soldier_id)

# Determine the size of the largest platoon and find all platoons with that size
largest_size = max(len(platoon) for platoon in platoons.values())
largest_platoons = [platoon for platoon in platoons.values() if len(platoon) == largest_size]

# Find the index of the first soldier in each of the largest platoons
first_occurrences = {tuple(platoon): min(soldier_ids.index(sid) for sid in platoon) for platoon in largest_platoons}

# Choose the platoon with the minimum index of its first soldier
selected_platoon = min(first_occurrences, key=first_occurrences.get)

# Write the output data to pluton.out
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(platoons)}\n")              # Number of platoons
    file.write(f"{largest_size}\n")               # Number of soldiers in the largest platoon
    file.write(f"{len(largest_platoons)}\n")      # Number of platoons with the maximum number of soldiers
    file.write(" ".join(selected_platoon) + "\n") # Composition of one platoon with the maximum number of soldiers
```

This code should now correctly identify the platoon with the maximum number of soldiers and select the one that appears first in the input while preserving the original order of soldier IDs within the platoon for the output.
