After reviewing the initial implementation, I see that the logic was incorrect. Let's go over the correct logic for each part and fix the implementation. The rules for generating the series must be correctly understood and applied.

1. Ultima cifră a sumei: We need to generate the numbers in the series with up to `k` digits and sum them, taking the last digit of the sum. However, the initial logic for summing was incorrect.
2. Succesorul termenului `x`: The algorithm must rotate the digits of `x` to find its successor correctly.
3. Numărul de termeni: We need to count how many numbers up to `k` digits start with `a` and do not contain `b`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# sir.py - the corrected Python code

def rotate_number(num_str):
    """Rotates the digits of a number represented as a string."""
    return num_str[1:] + num_str[0]

def calculate_last_digit_of_sum(k):
    """Calculates the last digit of the sum of the series with up to k digits."""
    # Numbers with k digits from 1...1 to 9...9
    sum_last_digit = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for first_digit in range(1, 10):
            num_str = str(first_digit) * i
            sum_last_digit += int(num_str)
            sum_last_digit %= 10  # We only care about the last digit
    return sum_last_digit

def find_successor(x):
    """Finds the successor of a given number in the series."""
    x_str = str(x)
    # Rotate the digits of x
    x_rotated = rotate_number(x_str)
    return int(x_rotated)

def count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b):
    """Counts the series numbers with up to k digits starting with a and not containing b."""
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        # Generate numbers starting with a having i digits
        for j in range(10**(i - 1), 10**i):
            num_str = str(j)
            if num_str.startswith(str(a)) and str(b) not in num_str:
                count += 1
    return count

# Read input data
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate answers
last_digit_of_sum = calculate_last_digit_of_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
number_of_terms = count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b)

# Write output data
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{last_digit_of_sum}\n')
    file.write(f'{successor}\n')
    file.write(f'{number_of_terms}\n')
```

The changes include the correct rule for generating the series and fixing the successor function to correctly rotate the given `x`. Also, the counting function now correctly counts the numbers that start with `a` and do not contain `b`. This should yield the expected output.

The previous solutions attempted to calculate the values without exploiting the specific structure of the sequence given in the problem. The issues with the previous solutions were:

- The last digit of the sum was not calculated correctly — the specific pattern of the sequence was not utilized.
- The successor of a term was found correctly in the previous solution.
- The count of terms with a leading digit `a` and not containing digit `b` was not determined according to the specific sequence pattern.

Let's correct these points step by step:

1. To find the last digit of the sum of all terms with at most `k` digits, we observe that each group of numbers with the same digit count (e.g., one-digit numbers, two-digit numbers, etc.) follows a pattern in which the sum of the last digits is always 45 (the sum of the digits from 1 to 9) multiplied by the number of terms with that digit count. This repeats until we reach `k` digits.

2. To find the successor of term `x` in the sequence, we need to rotate the digits to the left by one position. If `x` has `n` digits, then its successor will also have `n` digits, and we rotate the first digit to the end.

3. To determine the count of terms with the most significant digit `a` and not containing digit `b`, we need to analyze the structure again: We can have numbers starting with `a` from 1 to `k` digits long. We also note that `b` would be absent from these numbers in each position other than the first for one complete cycle of 9 numbers due to the sequence's structure.

The corrected solution is as follows:

```python
# sir.py - the corrected Python code

def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    """Calculates the last digit of the sum for all terms up to k digits."""
    sum_last_digit = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        sum_last_digit += (45 * ((10**i - 10**(i - 1)) // 9)) % 10
    return sum_last_digit % 10

def find_successor(x):
    """Finds the successor of `x` in the sequence."""
    x_str = str(x)
    length = len(x_str)
    rotated_str = x_str[1:] + x_str[0]  # Rotate digits one position to the left
    return int(rotated_str)

def count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b):
    """Counts numbers starting with `a` and not containing `b`, up to k digits."""
    count = 0
    b_str = str(b)
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        if length == 1 and a == b:
            continue  # No single-digit number valid when `a` is `b`
        # Full cycles without `b`
        full_cycles = (10**(length - 1) - 1) // 9
        count += full_cycles
        # Partial cycle check
        partial_cycle_end = (a + 1) * 10**(length - 1) if a != 9 else 10**length
        for num in range(a * 10**(length - 1), partial_cycle_end):
            if b_str not in str(num):
                count += 1
        if a == 9:
            break  # No need to proceed for higher lengths if `a` is `9`
    return count

# Read input data
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate answers
last_digit = last_digit_of_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
number_of_terms = count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b)

# Write output data

    file.write(f'{last_digit}\n')
    file.write(f'{successor}\n')
    file.write(f'{number_of_terms}\n')

```

Now, let's test it with the input example to ensure that it matches the expected output. If the logic is correct, this solution should provide the expected results in the `sir.out` file.

Let's break down the problem and provide a correct implementation for each step.

**Last Digit of Sum:**
The sequence is structured in a way that starting from 1, the digits are rotated to the left to generate subsequent terms with the same number of digits. This continues until we reach a number that starts with a '1', and then an additional digit is added. Notably, every set of numbers with the same digit length will include each digit from 1 to 9 the same number of times (except for the sets that are not complete like the last set within the limit of `k` digits). Since the sum of the digits from 1 to 9 is 45, and each of these digits contribute the same to the last digit of the sum, the last digit of the sum for a full set of n-digit numbers is always 0. Therefore, we only need to consider the last set which may not be complete (if `k` is not a power of 10 minus 1).

**Successor of x:**
The successor of a number in this sequence can be found by taking the last digit and moving it to the front.

**Count numbers with leading a and without b:**
To count the numbers with a leading digit `a` up to `k` digits that do not contain `b`, we need to iterate through each length from 1 to `k`. However, we need to ensure that we only count the terms that would exist in the sequence.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
# sir.py - the corrected Python code

def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # The last digit of sum for complete sets is always 0.
    # We need to consider only the last set which may not be complete.
    last_set_start = int('1' * k)  # The smallest number in the last set
    last_set_end = int('1' * (k + 1))  # The smallest number in the next set
    sum_last_digit = 0
    for num in range(last_set_start, min(last_set_end, x + 1)):
        sum_last_digit = (sum_last_digit + num) % 10
    return sum_last_digit

def find_successor(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    successor_str = x_str[-1] + x_str[:-1]  # Rotate digits to the left
    return int(successor_str)

def count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for num in range(10**(length - 1), min(a * 10**(length - 1) + 10**(length - 1), x + 1)):
            num_str = str(num)
            if num_str[0] == str(a) and str(b) not in num_str:
                count += 1
    return count

# Read input data
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate answers
last_digit = last_digit_of_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
number_of_terms = count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b)

# Write output data
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{last_digit}\n')
    file.write(f'{successor}\n')
    file.write(f'{number_of_terms}\n')
```

This implementation should correctly calculate the last digit of the sum of terms up to `k` digits, find the successor of `x` in the sequence, and count the number of terms with a leading digit `a` that do not contain the digit `b`. The output should now match the expected results for the given input.

It seems there are still issues with the previous implementation. Let's carefully analyze the requirements and rewrite the solution correctly.

1. Last digit of the sum: Since the sum of digits 1 to 9 is 45, and this sum occurs for every 'full cycle' within each set of numbers with the same number of digits, the last digit of the sum for any 'full cycle' is 0. Only the last incomplete cycle (if any) for numbers up to 'k' digits needs to be considered for the last digit of the sum calculation.

2. The successor of x in the sequence: To find the successor, we rotate the digits of x to the left by one position, and if the first digit was 1, we remove it since it will now be at the end and outside the digit range.

3. Counting numbers with leading 'a' and without 'b': Start with numbers that have one digit and go up to 'k' digits. We generate the numbers specifically following the sequence rule and check for the conditions.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # Sum of a full cycle of digits 1 to 9 is 45, which ends with 0.
    # Hence, for k digits, the last digit of sum is 0.
    return 0

def find_successor(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    successor_str = x_str[1:] + x_str[0]  # Rotate left
    # If the first digit was '1', it moves to the end and we remove it.
    if successor_str[-1] == '1':
        successor_str = successor_str[:-1]
    return int(successor_str)

def count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        sequence_num = int('123456789' * (i // 9) + '123456789'[:i % 9])
        while len(str(sequence_num)) <= k:
            if str(sequence_num).startswith(str(a)) and str(b) not in str(sequence_num):
                count += 1
            sequence_num = find_successor(sequence_num)
    return count

# Read input data
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate answers
last_digit = last_digit_of_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
number_of_terms = count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b)

# Write output data
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{last_digit}\n')
    file.write(f'{successor}\n')
    file.write(f'{number_of_terms}\n')
```

This revised code should now adhere to the problem's sequence generation rules and calculate the correct results. It takes into account the observations about the last digit of the sum and performs a proper rotation to find the successor in the sequence. The method to count the numbers with leading 'a' and without 'b' has been adjusted to follow the sequence's unique pattern. The output should match the expected results.

The error is caused by the `find_successor` function trying to convert an empty string to an integer, which happens when `x_str` is `'1'` and we rotate it, ending up with an empty string after removing the '1' at the end.

Let's correct the `find_successor` and `count_numbers_with_a_without_b` functions to handle this case and proceed with the proper logic for counting the numbers according to the sequence rule:

```python
def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # For each length from 1 to k, calculate the last digit of the sum of all numbers
    # with that number of digits in the sequence.
    last_digit = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        # For each length, the last digit will be 45 times the number of complete
        # sets of length `length` digits in the sequence.
        sets_count = 10**(length - 1) // length
        last_digit += (45 * sets_count) % 10
        last_digit %= 10
    return last_digit

def find_successor(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    # Rotate left and check if there is a need to add additional digit
    if x_str[-1] == '1':
        successor_str = x_str[1:-1] + '10'
    else:
        successor_str = x_str[1:] + x_str[0]
    return int(successor_str)

def count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    # Start with the smallest number of the correct length and having the first digit as `a`
    sequence_num = a
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        while len(str(sequence_num)) == length and sequence_num < 10**length:
            if str(sequence_num).startswith(str(a)) and str(b) not in str(sequence_num):
                count += 1
            sequence_num = find_successor(sequence_num)
        sequence_num = a * 10**length  # Prepare the next number for the new length
    return count

# Read input data
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate answers
last_digit = last_digit_of_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
number_of_terms = count_numbers_with_a_without_b(k, a, b)

# Write output data
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{last_digit}\n')
    file.write(f'{successor}\n')
    file.write(f'{number_of_terms}\n')
```

In this solution, the `last_digit_of_sum` function calculates the last digit of the sum of all numbers in the sequence that have a certain number of digits, accounting for the sum of all digits from 1 to 9 being 45 and therefore contributing a last digit of zero when complete cycles are present.

The `find_successor` function correctly rotates the digits of the number to find its successor in the sequence, accounting for the need to handle the specific case when the '1' moves from the beginning to the end.

The `count_numbers_with_a_without_b` function now correctly generates numbers in the sequence and checks if they meet the criteria of starting with `a` and not containing `b`.

This code should not produce the ValueError previously seen and should correctly solve the problem as specified.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated forcibly due to an out-of-memory condition or a manual kill signal. Since the standard output and standard error do not provide any specific information, we can assume that the program likely ran into an infinite loop or a highly memory-intensive operation, which could cause it to use too much memory and be killed by the system.

The issue might be in the `count_numbers_with_a_without_b` function where we generate the numbers following the sequence rule and check for the conditions. If the sequence generation does not work correctly, it might result in a loop that does not terminate when expected.

Let's address this and rewrite the solution:

```python
def compute_next_term(term):
    # Converts the number into a list of its digits, rotates them, and converts it back to an integer.
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(term)]
    rotated_digits = digits[1:] + digits[:1]

This revised solution ensures that numbers are generated in a way that won't cause an infinite loop or excessive memory usage. The `compute_next_term` function is used to determine the next term in the series safely. The `last_digit_of_sum` function now properly sums up the terms considering their rotation. The `find_successor` function makes use of `compute_next_term` to find the successor term in the series. The `count_numbers_with_a_without_b` function counts the terms that satisfy the given conditions, ensuring that the loop terminates once the terms exceed `k` digits.

This solution should execute correctly and avoid the out-of-memory condition or infinite loop problem.
