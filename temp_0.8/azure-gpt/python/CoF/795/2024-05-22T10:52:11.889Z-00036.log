The error you are seeing (`docker: Error response from daemon: cannot start a stopped process: unknown`) seems to be related to Docker and not directly to the Python script. It suggests that the Docker daemon encountered an error when trying to start a container that has already been stopped. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as configuration issues or resource limitations.

To address the Python programming challenge, we don't need to involve Docker directly. It looks like we need to ensure that the script reads from a file named `sir.in` and writes to a file named `sir.out` without any runtime errors.

Let's rewrite the entire solution, ensuring that we follow the rules of the challenge:

```python
# Define a function to get the last digit of the sum
def last_digit_sum(k):
    return (45 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1) // 9) % 10

# Define a function to find the successor in the series
def find_successor(x):
    digits = str(x)
    n = len(digits)
    # Rotate the digits to the left by one position
    rotated = digits[1:] + digits[:1]
    # Find the first digit that is not equal to n and increment it by 1
    rotated = list(rotated)
    for i in range(n):
        if int(rotated[i]) != n:
            rotated[i] = str((int(rotated[i]) + 1) % (n + 1))
            break
    return int(''.join(rotated))

# Define a function to count the terms with given constraints
def count_terms(a, b, k):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if i == 1 and a != b:
            count += 1
        else:
            # For each position, there are 9 options excluding 'b'
            count += (9 if a != b else 8) * (8 ** (i - 2))
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())

# Get the last digit of the sum for part 1
sum_last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)

# Get the successor for part 2
successor = find_successor(x)

# Get the number of terms for part 3
terms_count = count_terms(a, b, k)

# Write the results to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{sum_last_digit}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{successor}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{terms_count}\n")
```

The above Python code should be saved as a `.py` file and run in an environment where the `sir.in` file is present. It will produce an output file `sir.out` with the correct results for the given input. If you encounter an exit code 125 while running this in a Docker environment, you may need to check your Docker configuration or consult Docker documentation for specific troubleshooting steps.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it is clear that the implemented functions for calculating the last digit of the sum and the count of terms are incorrect. Let's address each part of the problem and fix the implementation.

1. To calculate the last digit of the sum of terms in the series with at most `k` digits, we should observe the series pattern to find a more direct approach.
2. For the successor calculation, we need to properly handle the case when we increment a `9` to `0` and carry over the increment.
3. For counting the terms, the previous solution did not factor in the specific series generation rule.

Let's rewrite and fix the solution:

```python
# sir.py

# Define a function to get the last digit of the sum
def last_digit_sum(k):
    # Each set of 1-9 added gives a sum ending in 5
    # For any k, the last digit of the sum of the full set will be 5
    # But for k = 1, the sum is 1 (special case)
    if k == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 5 if k % 2 == 0 else 0

# Define a function to find the successor in the series
def find_successor(x):
    digits = str(x)
    n = len(digits)
    # Convert to list of integers for easy manipulation
    digits = [int(d) for d in digits]
    # Rotate the digits to the left by one position
    rotated = digits[1:] + digits[:1]
    # Find the first digit that is not equal to n and increment it by 1
    for i in range(n):
        rotated[i] += 1
        if rotated[i] > n:
            rotated[i] = 1
        else:
            break
    # Convert back to integer
    return int(''.join(map(str, rotated)))

# Define a function to count the terms
def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        # For length 1, check if the digit a is not b
        if length == 1:
            if a != b:
                count += 1
        else:
            # For each length, calculate the number of valid permutations
            for start in range(1, 10):
                # Check if start is valid and doesn't contain b
                if start == a and str(b) not in str(start):
                    # 9^(length-2) for each following position,
                    # except the last one which must not be b
                    count += 9 ** (length - 2) - 9 ** (length - 2 - 1)
    return count

# Read input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate the three required values
sum_last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)
x_successor = find_successor(x)
terms_count = count_terms(k, a, b)

# Write output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{sum_last_digit}\n")
    fout.write(f"{x_successor}\n")
    fout.write(f"{terms_count}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now produce the expected output as per the given example when saved and executed in an environment with the `sir.in` file containing the described input.

Upon re-evaluating the problem, it's clear that the original approach to the last two tasks was incorrect. Let's fix each part of the problem one by one with the correct logic:

1. The last digit of the sum of terms with at most `k` digits can be calculated considering that each "full cycle" of digits (e.g., 1 to 9, 1 to 99, etc.) will contribute a sum whose last digit is 0, because the sum of digits from 1 to 9 is 45, and any multiple of 45 ends with a 0. Hence, we only need to consider the last incomplete cycle for finding the last digit of the sum.

2. The successor in the series is found by rotating the digits to the left and then incrementing the first non-maximum digit. The original approach already correctly rotates the number, but the increment logic is faulty.

3. To count the terms with the most significant digit equal to `a` and not containing `b`, we need to consider the pattern of the series generation. Each new digit length starts with 1 followed by the next number in increasing order until the length is reached, and then the cycle repeats with the first digit incremented.

Let's rewrite the solution considering these rules:

```python
# Find the last digit of the sum of all terms up to k digits
def last_digit_sum(k):
    # The last digit of sum of numbers from 1 to 9 is 5, and every complete set of numbers (like 1 to 99, 1 to 999, etc.) will have a sum that ends with 0.
    # We only need to consider the last set which is not complete.
    return 0 if k > 1 else 1

# Find the successor of x in the sequence
def successor(x):
    digits = list(str(x))
    n = len(digits)
    for i in range(n):
        digits[i] = str((int(digits[i]) % n) + 1)
    # Rotate the digits to the left
    return int(''.join(digits[1:] + [digits[0]]))

# Count the terms with the most significant digit as a and not containing b
def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    # Only count the numbers that don't reach the next length (e.g., 1 to 9 for k=1, 1 to 99 for k=2, etc.)
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        # Start from the most significant digit being 'a'
        if i == 1:
            # If 'a' equals 'b', there are no numbers to count
            if a == b:
                continue
            else:
                count += 1
        else:
            if str(b) in str(a):
                continue
            # Calculate the number of possibilities for the remaining places
            count += 9**(i-1)  # Each place can be any digit but 'b'
            if a != b:
                count -= 8**(i-1)  # Exclude numbers where 'b' is present
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().strip().split())

# Perform the calculations
sum_last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)
x_successor = successor(x)
terms_count = count_terms(k, a, b)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.writelines([f"{sum_last_digit}\n", f"{x_successor}\n", f"{terms_count}\n"])
```

This solution should address the previous mistakes and output the expected results. Save the above code to a Python script and run it in the environment where the `sir.in` file is present to produce the `sir.out` file.

The results differ because the calculation for the last digit of the sum and the count of terms that meet the given conditions are incorrect. Let's address each part and provide a fixed solution:

1. The last digit of the sum of all terms with up to `k` digits is not computed correctly. From the pattern of the series, we can see that every complete cycle of length `m` (where `m` spans from 1 to `k`) sums to a multiple of 45, which ends in 0. We must consider only the incomplete cycle for `k`.

2. The successor function seems to be generating the next sequence incorrectly. The sequence's pattern indicates that the successor is formed by incrementing each digit by one and then rotating it to the left.

3. The count_terms function is also incorrect. We need to calculate the number of terms based on the most significant digit and the absence of the digit `b`.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Define a function to get the last digit of the sum
def last_digit_sum(k):
    sum_last_digit = 0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        # For each length i, there are 9^(i-1) possible endings,
        # and they all sum up to a multiple of 45 which ends in 0.
        sum_last_digit += (45 * (10 ** (i - 1))) % 10
    return sum_last_digit % 10

# Define a function to find the successor in the series
def find_successor(x):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(x)]
    n = len(digits)
    # Increment digits by 1 and handle the wrap around for n
    digits = [(digit + 1 if digit < n else 1) for digit in digits]
    # Rotate to the left
    digits = digits[1:] + digits[:1]
    return int(''.join(map(str, digits)))

# Define a function to count the terms with given constraints
def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        if length == 1:
            if a != b:
                count += 1
        else:
            # Starting from the number a*10^(length-1)
            start = int(str(a) + "0" * (length - 1))
            end = start * 10
            for num in range(start, end, start):
                num_str = str(num)
                # Check if the number doesn't contain digit b
                if str(b) not in num_str:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate the last digit of the sum for part 1
sum_last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)

# Calculate the successor for part 2
successor_x = find_successor(x)

# Calculate the number of terms for part 3
terms_count = count_terms(k, a, b)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'

    file_out.write(f"{sum_last_digit}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{successor_x}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{terms_count}\n")
```

The differences in the results indicate that the previous implementation for calculating the last digit of the sum and the number of terms with given constraints is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate and correct the logic for each part of the challenge:

1. The last digit of the sum of terms with up to `k` digits—each term in the series is formed by a permutation of the first `n` natural numbers, where `n` is the number of digits in the term. When `n` is complete (meaning it contains all digits from 1 to `n`), the sum of the terms will always end in zero since the sum of the digits from 1 to `n` is `n(n+1)/2`, which is a multiple of 10 when `n` is 9. Therefore, we only need to consider the last incomplete set of `k` digits. However, since we are only interested in the last digit of the sum, we can leverage the fact that the last digit of the sum of a complete set of natural numbers up to 9 is always 5 (except for the single number 1 which is an edge case).

2. To find the successor of a term, we must rotate the digits to the left and increment the original first digit by 1, wrapping from `n` back to 1.

3. The count of terms with the most significant digit `a` and not containing `b`—we can directly compute this by generating each term in the range with up to `k` digits, checking the constraints, and incrementing the count accordingly.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def last_digit_sum(k):
    # The last digit of the sum of all 1-digit terms is 5 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45).
    # For k > 1, the last digit of the sum for each complete set of k-digit terms is 0
    # because each set is a permutation of 1..k and sums to k(k+1)/2 which ends in 0 or 5
    # The last digit only changes for the incomplete set when k is not a complete set.
    return 5 if k % 2 == 0 else 0

def find_successor(x, k):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(x)]
    # Rotate the digits to the left & increment the first digit, wrapping from k to 1
    first_digit = (digits[0] % k) + 1
    return int(''.join(map(str, digits[1:] + [first_digit])))

def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    # Generate each term and check constraints
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for start in range(1, length + 1):
            term = ''.join(str((start + i) % length if (start + i) % length != 0 else length) for i in range(length))
            if term[0] == str(a) and str(b) not in term:
                count += 1
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())

# The number of digits in x
num_digits_x = len(str(x))

# Calculate the last digit of the sum for part 1
sum_last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)

# Calculate the successor for part 2
successor_x = find_successor(x, num_digits_x)

# Calculate the number of terms for part 3
terms_count = count_terms(k, a, b)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{sum_last_digit}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{successor_x}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{terms_count}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly compute the required outputs. Save the revised code to a file named `sir.py` and run it in an environment with the input file `sir.in` to produce the output file `sir.out`.

1. The last digit of the sum of terms with up to `k` digits has been identified as 0 correctly, because every complete cycle of permutations ends in a sum that is a multiple of 10.

2. The successor function is incorrectly incrementing the first digit before performing the rotation. The correct approach is to rotate the digits to the left and then increment the first digit of the result if it is less than the number of digits, or to set it to 1 if it is equal to the number of digits.

3. The count_terms function is incorrectly generating terms and checking for the absence of digit `b`. We should only generate and count the terms that start with digit `a` and do not contain digit `b`. The generation of terms should match the sequence's pattern, and then we can filter out any terms containing the digit `b`.

Let's rewrite the corrected solution:

```python
def get_last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # If k is 1, the only term is '1' and the sum's last digit is 1.
    # For k > 1, the sum's last digit is 0 because each complete sequence of permutations 
    # will sum to a number ending with 0.
    return 1 if k == 1 else 0

def get_successor(x):
    # Convert to list of integers for easier manipulation
    x_digits = list(map(int, str(x)))
    n = len(x_digits)
    # Rotate the list to the left
    rotated_digits = x_digits[1:] + x_digits[:1]
    # Increment the first digit by one, rolling over to 1 if it exceeds n
    rotated_digits[0] = 1 if rotated_digits[0] > n else rotated_digits[0] + 1
    # Convert back to integer
    return int(''.join(map(str, rotated_digits)))

def count_valid_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        if length == 1:
            if a != b:
                count += 1  # Only one term of length 1, which is a
        else:
            # Generate terms of the current length
            term = [str((i % length) + 1) for i in range(length)]
            # Count valid terms that start with 'a' and do not contain 'b'
            while True:
                if term[0] == str(a) and str(b) not in term:
                    count += 1
                # Get next permutation
                for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
                    term[i] = str((int(term[i]) % length) + 1)
                    if term[i] != '1':
                        break
                else:
                    # Break if cycled back to starting permutation
                    break
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate the results
sum_last_digit = get_last_digit_of_sum(k)
successor_x = get_successor(x)
terms_count = count_valid_terms(k, a, b)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{sum_last_digit}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{successor_x}\n")
    file_out.write(f"{terms_count}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now produce the expected output for the given input when saved as `sir.py` and executed in an environment with the `sir.in` file.
