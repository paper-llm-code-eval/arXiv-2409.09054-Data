The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to an incorrect calculation of the last digit of the sum of all sequence terms formed by at most `k` digits. In the initial solution provided, I attempted to generate the entire sequence up to `k` digits and then sum it up. However, this approach is not only inefficient but also incorrect, as it did not account for the correct construction of the series.

The sequence itself can be seen to be all permutations of all digits starting from 1 to `k` in ascending order where each permutation starts with a different number. 

We need to come up with a more efficient way to calculate the last digit of the sum without generating the full sequence. We can optimize the solution by observing the patterns in the sequence for the last digit of the sum.

Let's rewrite the solution with a correct approach to each part of the problem:

```python
def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # For every full cycle of 1 to 9, the sum of the last digits is 0 (1+2+...+9 = 45).
    # We only need to consider the last incomplete cycle if k < 9.
    return 0 if k == 9 else sum(range(1, k + 1)) % 10

def find_successor(x):
    # Convert the number to a string to rotate the digits.
    str_x = str(x)
    # The successor is created by moving the first digit to the end.
    successor = str_x[1:] + str_x[0]
    return int(successor) # There's no need to check length here, x is always a term in the sequence.

def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    # Generate only the first term of each length up to k.
    for digits in range(1, k + 1):
        first_term = int(''.join(str((i % digits) + 1) for i in range(digits)))
        # Check if it starts with a and does not contain b.
        if str(first_term).startswith(str(a)) and str(b) not in str(first_term):
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
        k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())

    last_digit_sum = last_digit_of_sum(k)
    successor = find_successor(x)
    count = count_terms(k, a, b)

    with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{last_digit_sum}\n{successor}\n{count}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should be efficient and produce the correct output. It optimizes each part of the challenge to ensure that we don't perform unnecessary calculations or generate massive sequences. The `last_digit_of_sum` function takes advantage of the pattern in the sum of the digits, the `find_successor` function correctly rotates the digits of `x`, and the `count_terms` function counts only the necessary terms based on the first digit and the absence of digit `b`.

It appears that my prior explanation and solution contained errors in calculating both the last digit of the sum and the count of terms with the specified conditions. Let's address these issues and provide a corrected solution.

### Last Digit of Sum Calculation

The sequence consists of permutations of digits. Every possible non-repeating digit set from 1 to `k` is present, and for each fixed number of digits, the sum of the last digits for a complete set of permutations (1 to the number of digits) is always 0 modulo 10.

Given this, we can conclude that the last digit of the sum of the sequence up to `k` digits is always 0, except for when `k` is less than 9 and there's an incomplete set of permutations. In that case, we need only consider the permutations of the largest number with `k` digits, because all smaller permutations will sum up to a multiple of 10.

### Count Terms with Conditions

The sequence is formed by cyclic permutations of consecutive digits starting from 1 up to the maximum digit, which is the length of the number. We don't actually need to generate the sequence but can directly calculate the count of terms with the specified conditions.

To find the count of sequences starting with digit `a` and not containing `b`, we should note that for a given length, there's exactly one sequence that starts with `a`. However, if `b` is less than or equal to the length of the sequence, that sequence will contain `b`, and we should not count it.

Now let's rewrite the solution:

```python
def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # The last digit of the sum for `k` < 9 is the last digit of the sum of 1 to `k`.
    return sum(range(1, k + 1)) % 10 if k < 9 else 0

def find_successor(x):
    str_x = str(x)
    # Rotate digits to the left by one position.
    successor = str_x[1:] + str_x[0]
    return int(successor)

def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    # Check if there's a term starting with `a` and not containing `b` for each length.
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        if a <= length and (length < b or b == 1 and length != 9):
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
        k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())

    last_digit_sum = last_digit_of_sum(k)
    successor = find_successor(x)
    count = count_terms(k, a, b)

    with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{last_digit_sum}\n{successor}\n{count}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected solution should now provide the correct result for the given input. The `last_digit_of_sum` function handles the special case for `k` < 9 correctly, `find_successor` rotates the digits as required, and `count_terms` checks for the existence of `a` as the starting digit and `b`'s absence accurately.

I apologize for the confusion, let's try to correct the approach. The errors come from incorrectly calculating the last digit of the sum and the count of terms starting with `a` and not containing `b`.

### Last Digit of Sum Calculation
For part 1, we need to find the last digit of the sum of terms with at most `k` digits. Each term is a permutation of consecutive numbers starting from 1. When we sum all such numbers with up to `k` digits, the last digit of the sum doesn't change because the sum of digits 1 through 9 is 45, which ends in 0, and permutations of these just rearrange the digits without changing the sum.

However, we must be aware that the last set of permutations may be incomplete if `k` is not 9. For example, for `k = 3`, the last set is 123, 231, and 312, and their sum is 666, which ends in 6. This sum would be added for each cycle of 9 numbers, except for the last cycle if it is incomplete.

### Count Terms with Conditions
For part 3, the count of terms with the most significant digit `a` and not containing `b` can be calculated directly as well. Every number in the sequence is a permutation of length 1 to `k` digits. When `k` is less than 9, we may have incomplete permutations, and we have to be careful not to include the digit `b` in our count.

### Rewrite Solution

Let's rewrite the solution, this time with the correct approach to each part of the problem:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        k, x, a, b = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    return k, x, a, b

def write_output(file_name, last_digit_sum, successor, count):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines([f"{last_digit_sum}\n", f"{successor}\n", f"{count}\n"])

def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # The sum of a complete set of `k`-digit permutations always ends with 0.
    # We only consider the last incomplete set if `k` < 9.
    last_digit = 0
    if k < 9:
        last_digit = sum(range(1, k+1))
    return last_digit % 10

def find_successor(x):
    # The successor is calculated by rotating the digits to the left.
    str_x = str(x)
    successor = str_x[1:] + str_x[0]
    return int(successor)

def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        if (length < a or str(b) in str(a) or (str(b) in str(a + length - 1) and a + length - 1 <= 9)):
            continue
        for start in range(a, 10):
            if start + length - 1 > 9:  # If the permutation exceeds the digit '9', wrap around.
                break
            if str(b) not in str(start):  # Check if 'b' is not in the current start position.
                count += 1
                break
    return count

def main():
    k, x, a, b = read_input('sir.in')
    last_digit_sum = last_digit_of_sum(k)
    successor = find_successor(x)
    count = count_terms(k, a, b)
    write_output('sir.out', last_digit_sum, successor, count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This corrected solution should produce the correct last digit of the sum for the given `k`, find the successor to `x` correctly, and count the number of terms starting with `a` and not containing `b`.

Let's address the issues by re-evaluating the requirements and providing a corrected solution that should match the expected result.

### Last Digit of Sum Calculation

The sum of digits 1 through 9 is 45, which ends in 0. When all permutations of these digits are summed, the last digit remains 0 because permutations do not change the sum's last digit. Thus, the last digit of the sum for any `k` is always 0.

### Finding Successor

To find the successor of `x` in the sequence, we should rotate `x` to the left by one position. If `x` starts with a 1 followed by a sequence of consecutive numbers, then the successor is not a simple rotation, but rather a new sequence starting with the next digit after the last digit in `x`. However, if the last digit is a 9, we start over from 1.

### Count Terms with Conditions

To count the terms that start with the digit `a` and do not contain the digit `b`, we should note that in every complete set of permutations for a given number of digits, each digit from 1 to the maximum digit appears exactly once as the first digit.

So, for each number of digits from 1 to `k`, we need to check if `a` is a potential first digit and if `b` does not appear in the subsequent digits.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # The last digit of the sum is always 0 because permutations of 1 to 9 sum up to a multiple of 10.
    return 0

def find_successor(x):
    str_x = str(x)
    if str_x.startswith('1') and all(int(str_x[i]) == i + 1 for i in range(len(str_x))):
        # If x starts with '1' followed by consecutive numbers, the successor is the next number starting with the next digit.
        if str_x[-1] == '9':  # Wrap around if the last digit is 9.
            return int('1' * (len(str_x) + 1))
        return int(str_x[-1] + '1' * len(str_x))
    else:
        # Otherwise, simply rotate the digits to the left by one position.
        successor = str_x[1:] + str_x[0]
        return int(successor)

def count_terms(k, a, b):
    count = 0
    for digits in range(1, k + 1):
        # For each length, check if 'a' can be the first digit and 'b' is not in the number.
        if a <= digits and str(b) not in ''.join(str((i % digits) + 1) for i in range(digits)):
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
        k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())

    last_digit_sum = last_digit_of_sum(k)
    successor = find_successor(x)
    count = count_terms(k, a, b)

    with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{last_digit_sum}\n{successor}\n{count}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should now provide the correct output. The `last_digit_of_sum` function simply returns 0, `find_successor` calculates the successor by considering special cases, and `count_terms` counts the terms starting with `a` and not containing `b` by checking the range of possible first digits for each number of digits from 1 to `k`.

The issue still lies in the incorrect calculation of the count of terms starting with the digit `a` and not containing the digit `b`. The last digit of the sum and successor calculations are correct based on the expectations. We need to revise the counting logic to accurately determine how many numbers meet the specified conditions.

The problem states that each term in the sequence is generated by a cyclic permutation of an increasing sequence of natural numbers. For the third part of the problem, we need to count how many times the digit `a` can be the starting digit of a permutation that does not include the digit `b`.

Let us analyze the pattern:

1. If the number of digits is `1`, there is only one term that starts with `a` and it does not contain `b` (unless `a` is `b`).
2. If the number of digits is `2` or more, the first digit `a` will appear as the starting digit once in the cycle of permutations. We need to ensure that the cycle does not contain the digit `b`.
3. Since the sequence cycles through all digits for numbers with more than one digit, the digit `b` must not be in a cycle of a given length for `a` to be counted.

We need to ensure that the digit `b` is not included in the maximum set of consecutive numbers starting from `a`. For a given length `n`, the set would be `{a, a+1, ..., a+n-1}`, wrapping around from 9 to 1. If `b` is in this set, we do not count that length.

Let's rewrite the solution with the corrected counting logic:

```python
def find_successor(x):
    # Rotate the number x to find its successor in the sequence.
    str_x = str(x)
    successor = str_x[1:] + str_x[0]
    return int(successor)

def count_terms(k, a, b):
    # Count the number of terms where the first digit is `a` and it does not contain `b`.
    count = 0
    # Go through each possible length up to k.
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        if a != b:
            # Generate the set of consecutive numbers from `a`.
            consecutive_set = {(a + i) % 10 for i in range(length)}
            # If `b` is not in the set, increment the count.
            if b not in consecutive_set or (10 in consecutive_set and b == 0):
                count += 1
    return count

def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # The last digit of the sum is 0 for k = 9. Otherwise, it is the last digit of the sum of numbers from 1 to k.
    return 0 if k == 9 else sum(range(1, k + 1)) % 10

def main():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
        k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().strip().split())

    # Calculate the last digit of the sum.
    last_digit_sum = last_digit_of_sum(k)
    # Find the successor of x.
    successor = find_successor(x)
    # Count the number of terms starting with `a` and not containing `b`.
    count = count_terms(k, a, b)

    # Write the results to sir.out.
    with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{last_digit_sum}\n{successor}\n{count}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised code should correctly count the number of terms starting with `a` and not containing `b`, and it should now match the expected output for the given input data.

I apologize for the oversight. The remaining error is in the calculation of the last digit of the sum. Upon closer examination, the sequence is composed of permutations of numbers starting from 1 to `k`. For `k >= 9`, the sum of the last digits will always be 0 because the sum of the digits 1 through 9 is 45 (which ends in 0) and when `k < 9`, we need to consider incomplete sequences.

Let's address the calculation of the last digit of the sum for `k < 9`. We can observe that when `k = 1`, the sequence is just [1]. For `k = 2`, the sequence is [1, 12, 21]. The sum of the last digits in this case would be `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`. For `k = 3`, the sequence is [1, 12, 21, 123, 231, 312], and the sum of the last digits is `1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 10`, which ends in 0. This pattern continues, where the sum of the last digits for all sequences with `k` digits (where `k` is not 9) is the sum of the numbers from 1 to `k`.

The count of terms starting with `a` and not containing `b` is correctly implemented in the previous solution, as is the finding of the successor.

Let's correct the solution with the proper calculation of the last digit of the sum:

```python
def last_digit_of_sum(k):
    # For `k < 9`, the last digit of the sum is the sum of the numbers from 1 to k.
    # For `k = 9`, the sum of 1...9 is 45, which ends in 0, and the pattern repeats.
    return sum(range(1, k + 1)) % 10 if k < 9 else 0

def find_successor(x):
    # Convert x to a string and rotate it to the left to find the successor.

This solution should now correctly calculate:
- The last digit of the sum as 0 for `k = 9` and as the sum of numbers from 1 to `k` mod 10 otherwise.
- The successor of `x` by rotating its digits to the left.
- The count of terms starting with `a` and not containing `b` by generating sequences for each length from 1 to `k`.
