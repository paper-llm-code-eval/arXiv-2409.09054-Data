În clasa lui *Dexter* sunt $N$ elevi de înălțimi distincte. La ora de sport, ei sunt așezați în linie, de la stânga la dreapta. Profesorul lor, *Johnny*, va selecta pentru un exercițiu elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive în linie, astfel încât cel mai înalt elev dintre cei selectați să se afle în prima jumătate a acestora.

De exemplu, dacă elevii au, în ordine, înălțimile $1$, $5$, $4$, atunci profesorul poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $5$ și $4$, dar nu poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $1$ și $5$. Desigur, există mai multe moduri de a selecta elevii astfel încât să fie satisfăcută condiția de mai sus. Profesorul *Johnny* ar vrea să afle în câte moduri se poate face acest lucru.

# Cerinţă
Dându-se $N$ și înălțimile elevilor din clasă, aflați în câte moduri pot fi selectați oricâți elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive, astfel încât să fie îndeplinită condiția din enunț.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `leftmax.in` conține, pe prima linie, numărul $N$, iar pe a doua linie înălțimile elevilor în ordinea în care sunt așezați în linie.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `leftmax.out` conține pe prima linie răspunsul la cerință, sub formă de rest al împărțirii la $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ ($\text{modulo }1\ 000\ 000\ 007$).

# Restricţii și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Înălțimea oricărui elev este un număr întreg cuprins între $1$ și $N$, inclusiv.
- Dacă se selectează un număr impar de elevi, atunci considerăm că cel din mijlocul selecției se află în prima jumătate a elevilor selectați.
- Pentru 10 puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$ și elevii sunt ordonați descrescător după înălțime.
- Pentru alte 35 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru alte 20 de puncte, $N \leq 30\ 000$.

I apologize for the oversight. The provided solution did not correctly implement the logic to count the valid ways according to the problem statement; in particular, it did not properly handle the requirement that the tallest student must be in the first half of the selected consecutive students.

Let's correct the logic. We can approach this problem by iterating through each student and considering them as the tallest student in a valid subsequence. We then need to count valid subsequences that end with that student. A subsequence is valid if the tallest student (the current student in the iteration) is in the first half, which means we can extend the subsequence to the left until we have at least as many students to the right.

Here is a revised solution that should address the issue:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def count_valid_sequences(heights, n):
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each student considering them as the tallest in a valid subsequence
    for i in range(n):
        # Count subsequences that end at the current student's position
        # We can include up to twice as many students to the left as to the right (ensuring tallest is in the first half)
        left_limit = max(0, i - (n - 1 - i))
        count += (i - left_limit + 1)
    
    return count % MOD

# Read from 'leftmax.in'
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Sort the heights along with their original indices
indexed_heights = sorted([(h, i) for i, h in enumerate(heights)], reverse=True)

# Count the number of valid intervals
result = count_valid_sequences(indexed_heights, n)

# Write to 'leftmax.out'
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This revised solution now correctly considers the position of the tallest student in the group and counts the ways accordingly. It starts from the tallest student and considers each as a possible end of the subsequence, ensuring that the tallest is in the first half by limiting how far to the left we can go. It writes the output to `leftmax.out` as required.

After evaluating the previous solution, it's clear that the approach is incorrect because it does not account for all possible valid sequences. The problem requires us to consider every subsequence where the tallest student is in the first half, including those where the tallest student is not at the end of the sequence.

To fix the approach, we need to consider all possible starting and ending points for each subsequence, ensuring that the tallest student within any given subsequence is in the first half. This can be achieved by efficiently using a stack to track the tallest student's index as we iterate through the heights.

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement this logic:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read from 'leftmax.in'
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the valid subintervals
stack = []
result = 0

# Iterate over the heights
for i in range(n):
    # Maintain a decreasing stack and count the valid subintervals
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        # Pop the smaller height
        stack.pop()
    
    # If the stack is not empty, calculate valid subintervals for the current index
    if stack:
        # The top of the stack is the previous taller student
        # Count subintervals starting from anywhere between current index and previous taller student's index
        result += (i - stack[-1]) * (stack[-1] - (stack[-2] if len(stack) > 1 else -1))
    
    # Add the current index to the stack
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the result modulo the given MOD
result = result % MOD

# Write to 'leftmax.out'
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution uses a decreasing stack to keep track of the indices of the tallest students. For each student, it counts the number of ways they can be the tallest student in a valid subinterval and accumulates this count in the result. The result is then written to `leftmax.out`. This should now match the expected output.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems there was a mistake in the handling of the intervals. Let's correct the approach with a new solution.

This problem can be rephrased as finding the number of subarrays such that the maximum element is not in the second half of the subarray. To do this, we can find the "next greater element" for each student, which will be the right boundary where they cannot be the tallest in the subarray. For the left boundary, we have two cases for even-length and odd-length subarrays to ensure the tallest is not in the second half.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def count_ways(heights, n):
    # Next greater element to the right
    next_greater = [n] * n
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < heights[i]:
            next_greater[stack.pop()] = i
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Count ways
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Left boundary for odd-length subarrays
        left_odd = i // 2 + 1
        # Left boundary for even-length subarrays
        left_even = (i + 1) // 2 + 1
        # Right boundary
        right = next_greater[i] - i
        # Add the number of odd-length subarrays
        count += left_odd * right
        # Add the number of even-length subarrays
        count += left_even * right
        count %= MOD
    
    return count

# Read from 'leftmax.in'
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the number of ways
result = count_ways(heights, n)

# Write to 'leftmax.out'
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution finds the number of ways to select any number of consecutive students such that the tallest is in the first half. It writes the answer modulo $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ to `leftmax.out`. This solution should now yield the correct output.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous attempts. I'll rectify the approach and provide a correct solution.

To solve this problem, we must count the number of possible intervals where the tallest student within is positioned in the first half of the interval. We'll accomplish this by finding, for each position, the farthest position to the left and to the right we can go while keeping the student at the current position the tallest in the interval. For any given position `i`, the number of possible intervals where `i` is in the first half is equal to the number of positions to the left that can be the start of the interval multiplied by the number of positions to the right that can be the end of the interval.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read from 'leftmax.in'
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# We use a stack to maintain the indices of the heights in decreasing order
# This helps us quickly find the range for each student where they are the tallest
stack = []
left_limits = [0] * n
right_limits = [0] * n

# Find the left limit for each student
for i in range(n):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    left_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    stack.append(i)

stack.clear()

# Find the right limit for each student
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    right_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else n
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the number of valid subsequences
result = 0
for i in range(n):
    left_count = i - left_limits[i]
    right_count = right_limits[i] - i
    # The tallest can be anywhere in the left half, which may be even or odd in size
    # For odd sizes, the middle is considered part of the left half
    result += (left_count // 2 + left_count % 2) * right_count
    result %= MOD

# Write to 'leftmax.out'
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly compute the number of ways the tallest student can be positioned in the first half of any interval of consecutive students and write the result to the file `leftmax.out`, matching the expected output.

The discrepancies in the expected and found results were due to incorrect accounting for valid intervals where the tallest student is in the first half. We need to fix the approach by correctly determining the range where each student is the tallest and ensuring that this student lies within the first half of any selected range.

We will use a stack to determine for each student the nearest taller student on the left and the nearest taller student on the right. This will allow us to calculate the number of valid ways to form intervals for each student. We will then sum these counts for each student to get the final answer.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read from 'leftmax.in'
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the stack and the result
stack = []
result = 0

# Process each student to calculate valid intervals
for i in range(n):
    # While the current height is greater than the height of the last student in the stack
    while stack and heights[i] > heights[stack[-1]]:
        # Pop the last student and calculate the number of valid intervals that include this student as the tallest
        tallest = stack.pop()
        left_index = stack[-1] if stack else -1
        # The number of valid intervals is the number of choices on the left (tallest/2 if even, (tallest+1)/2 if odd)
        # times the number of choices on the right (i - tallest)
        left_choices = (tallest - left_index + 1) // 2
        right_choices = i - tallest
        result = (result + left_choices * right_choices) % MOD
    # Push the current student onto the stack
    stack.append(i)

# Process the remaining students in the stack who are the tallest within their intervals
while stack:
    tallest = stack.pop()
    left_index = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    # The number of valid intervals is the number of choices on the left (tallest/2 if even, (tallest+1)/2 if odd)
    # times the number of choices on the right (n - tallest)
    left_choices = (tallest - left_index + 1) // 2
    right_choices = n - tallest
    result = (result + left_choices * right_choices) % MOD

# Write to 'leftmax.out'
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly compute the number of ways the tallest student can be positioned in the first half of any interval of consecutive students, and write the result to the file `leftmax.out`, matching the expected output.

Let's step through the problem again and correct the logic to ensure we obtain the expected result.

We need to count all possible consecutive sequences where the tallest student is in the first half. This means for each student, we need to consider sequences extending to the left and right and count those where the student is the tallest and is in the first half.

The correct approach for this problem is as follows:
1. Track the index of the tallest student so far as we move left to right.
2. For each student, consider this student as the tallest in the sequence and calculate the number of valid sequences that can end at this student.
3. Add the contribution of each student to the total count.

A student at index `i` can be the end of a sequence starting from any index `j` where `leftmax[j] < height[i]` and the length of the sequence is `2*(i-j)+1` or less (to keep the tallest student in the first half).

We can achieve this by maintaining a monotonic stack. For each element, we find the number of valid subsequences where it is the tallest. If the stack is not empty, the element at the top of the stack is the previous taller element. The number of ways to form subsequences ending with the current element is the difference between its index and the index of the previous taller element.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read from 'leftmax.in'
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize variables
stack = [] # Stack to store indices of students in descending height order
result = 0 # Variable to store the result

# Main logic
for i in range(n):
    # While there is a previous student taller than the current one, pop from stack
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()

    # If stack is not empty, it means there is a taller student before the current one
    if stack:
        # The number of valid sequences that can end with the current student
        # is given by the index difference between the current and the previous taller student
        result += (i - stack[-1])
        result %= MOD

    # Push the current index onto the stack
    stack.append(i)

# Write to 'leftmax.out'
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This code takes into account the sequences ending with each student as the tallest and ensures that the tallest student is always in the first half of the sequence. It correctly calculates the total count by iterating over each student and contributes the count of valid sequences ending with that student. The result is then written to `leftmax.out`. This should match the expected output for the given problem.
