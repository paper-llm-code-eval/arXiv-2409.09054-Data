În clasa lui *Dexter* sunt $N$ elevi de înălțimi distincte. La ora de sport, ei sunt așezați în linie, de la stânga la dreapta. Profesorul lor, *Johnny*, va selecta pentru un exercițiu elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive în linie, astfel încât cel mai înalt elev dintre cei selectați să se afle în prima jumătate a acestora.

De exemplu, dacă elevii au, în ordine, înălțimile $1$, $5$, $4$, atunci profesorul poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $5$ și $4$, dar nu poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $1$ și $5$. Desigur, există mai multe moduri de a selecta elevii astfel încât să fie satisfăcută condiția de mai sus. Profesorul *Johnny* ar vrea să afle în câte moduri se poate face acest lucru.

# Cerinţă
Dându-se $N$ și înălțimile elevilor din clasă, aflați în câte moduri pot fi selectați oricâți elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive, astfel încât să fie îndeplinită condiția din enunț.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `leftmax.in` conține, pe prima linie, numărul $N$, iar pe a doua linie înălțimile elevilor în ordinea în care sunt așezați în linie.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `leftmax.out` conține pe prima linie răspunsul la cerință, sub formă de rest al împărțirii la $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ ($\text{modulo }1\ 000\ 000\ 007$).

# Restricţii și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Înălțimea oricărui elev este un număr întreg cuprins între $1$ și $N$, inclusiv.
- Dacă se selectează un număr impar de elevi, atunci considerăm că cel din mijlocul selecției se află în prima jumătate a elevilor selectați.
- Pentru 10 puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$ și elevii sunt ordonați descrescător după înălțime.
- Pentru alte 35 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru alte 20 de puncte, $N \leq 30\ 000$.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Reading data from the input file
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

answer = 0
stack = []

# For each height, we determine the number of sequences to the left that satisfy the condition
for height in heights:
    cnt = 1  # The height itself can always form a valid sequence
    while stack and stack[-1][0] < height:
        cnt += stack.pop()[1]
    if stack:
        cnt += stack[-1][1]
    stack.append((height, cnt))
    answer = (answer + cnt) % MOD

# Writing the answer to the output file
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(answer))
```

The python code above reads data from `leftmax.in`, processes the heights to find the number of valid sequences where the tallest student in the sequence is in the first half, and writes the result mod $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ to `leftmax.out`. The solution uses a stack to keep track of potential sequences and their counts, ensuring the tallest student's condition is met.

The issue with the original solution is that it does not correctly handle the case when the next height might combine with multiple previous non-overlapping subarrays to form valid sequences. When a new height is added to the stack, it should only form new combinations with the subarray immediately before it, not with all subarrays to its left. Therefore, we need to modify the algorithm to correctly consider these cases.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct logic. We will iterate through the `heights` list and use a stack to keep track of the heights and their leftmost position that can form a valid subarray. For each element, we will pop from the stack until we find a taller student and count the number of ways it can be at the beginning of a valid subarray.

Here is the updated solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_ways(heights):
    stack = []
    answer = 0
    for i, height in enumerate(heights):
        # Count the number of ways this height can start a valid subarray
        while stack and stack[-1][0] < height:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            # This height can form a valid subarray with the previous taller height
            answer += (i - stack[-1][1])
        else:
            # This height can start a valid subarray anywhere to its left
            answer += i
        stack.append((height, i))
        answer %= MOD
    return answer

# Reading data from the input file
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Writing the answer to the output file
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(count_ways(heights)))
```

This solution should correctly count the number of valid ways to select consecutive students while ensuring the tallest one is in the first half. It writes the answer to `leftmax.out`, as required.

The revised solution still does not produce the expected output because it undercounts the number of valid subarrays. The main issue is that the algorithm does not adequately account for subarrays that include the current height as the tallest element and end at the current height or any of the previous lower heights.

The correct approach should increment the answer by the possible indices to the left where a valid subarray can end, given that the current height is the tallest in the subarray. We need to keep track of the number of such positions and update answer accordingly. The solution also needs to consider the fact that if the subarray has an even length and the current height is at the exact middle, it is still valid.

Here's the fixed algorithm:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to count the number of valid ways
def count_ways(heights):
    answer = 0
    stack = []
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        # Pop smaller elements from the stack
        while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < heights[i]:
            stack.pop()

        # If stack is not empty, only consider subarrays starting after the last taller element
        if stack:
            prev_taller_index = stack[-1]
            ways_to_form_subarray = (i - prev_taller_index)
        else:
            # If stack is empty, all positions to the left are valid starts
            ways_to_form_subarray = (i + 1)

        # Divide by two, rounding up, as the tallest has to be before the middle
        answer += -(-ways_to_form_subarray // 2)
        answer %= MOD

        # Push current element to stack
        stack.append(i)

    return answer

# Reading data from the input file
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result and write it to the output file
result = count_ways(heights)
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution keeps track of the stack of indices of the heights, popping off any that are shorter than the current height. When considering a new height, it calculates the number of valid consecutive subarrays that can end at any of the heights to its left and in which it is the tallest, accounting for whether the length of the subarray is even or odd. The result is written to the output file `leftmax.out`.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's re-evaluate the problem and correct the algorithm.

For each student, we want to count the number of ways we can form a valid sequence ending with this student, such that the tallest student is in the first half of the sequence. This means we need to find the closest student to the left who is taller (as the sequence can only extend as far as them while remaining valid) and count the number of subsequences we can form within this range.

One way to do this is to maintain a stack of pairs, where each pair contains the height of a student and the index of that student. We pop from the stack until the current student is the tallest, then the index of the last popped student gives us the range within which we can form valid subsequences. We then push the current student onto the stack.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to count the number of valid ways
def count_ways(heights):
    answer = 0
    stack = []
    for i, height in enumerate(heights):
        # While the stack is not empty and the current height is taller than the
        # height at the top of the stack, pop from the stack.
        while stack and stack[-1][0] < height:
            stack.pop()

        # If the stack is not empty, the range within which we can form valid
        # subsequences is between the current index and the index of the last
        # taller student.
        if stack:
            valid_range = i - stack[-1][1]
        else:
            # If the stack is empty, the valid range includes all previous students.
            valid_range = i

        # The number of valid subsequences is half the valid range, rounded up.
        answer += -(-valid_range // 2)
        answer %= MOD

        # Push the current student onto the stack.
        stack.append((height, i))
    
    return answer

# Reading data from the input file
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result and write it to the output file
result = count_ways(heights)
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution reads the heights from `leftmax.in`, applies the described algorithm to count the number of valid subsequences, and then writes the result modulo $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ to `leftmax.out`. The use of integer division with rounding up ensures that the tallest student is in the first half of the sequence, even when the sequence length is even.

My previous solutions have not properly accounted for all possible valid subarrays. To correct this, we need to consider all the valid subarrays ending at each height and ensure that the tallest among them is at the beginning or middle of the subarray.

For each student (height), we need to find the furthest student to the left who is taller, as this will give the range within which the current student can be the tallest. We can then count all possible subarrays within this range while ensuring that the tallest student (the current one) is in the first half of the subarray. 

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the result and stack
result = 0
stack = []

# Iterate through the heights and use a stack to keep track of indices of potential tallest students
for i, height in enumerate(heights):
    # Remove all previous students who are shorter because they cannot be the tallest in any subarray that includes the current student
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < height:
        stack.pop()
    
    # The number of subarrays where the current student can be the tallest is determined by the distance to the previous taller student
    if stack:
        result += (i - stack[-1]) // 2  # Only consider the first half
    else:
        result += (i + 1) // 2  # If no previous taller student, consider all previous students
    
    # Push the current index onto the stack
    stack.append(i)
    
# Take the result modulo 10^9 + 7
result %= MOD

with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result))
```

This corrected solution works by maintaining a stack of indices of the tallest students seen so far. For each new student, it counts how many valid subarrays can end at this student with the student being the tallest one. The solution writes the final result to `leftmax.out` after taking the modulo as required.

Upon revisiting the problem, it seems there is a misunderstanding of the requirements for valid subsequences. We need to ensure that for every subsequence selected, the tallest student is within the first half, including when an odd number of students are selected.

Let's implement a new solution that keeps track of the index of the last tallest student seen so far. For each student, we find the range within which they can be the tallest. When the stack is not empty, we take the difference between the current index and the index from the top of the stack, which represents the last taller student. We add half of this range (rounded up) to the answer for subsequences of odd length and half (rounded down) for even lengths.

Here is the correct solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

result = 0
stack = []

for i, height in enumerate(heights):
    # Count valid subsequences starting from the last taller student (or beginning if none)
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= height:
        stack.pop()
    
    left_bound = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    
    # The possible valid subsequences include those of odd and even length
    # For odd length, the tallest student (current one) can be exactly at the middle
    total_subsequences = i - left_bound
    odd_length_subsequences = (total_subsequences + 1) // 2
    result += odd_length_subsequences
    result %= MOD

    # Add the current student to the stack
    stack.append(i)

with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution should now correctly compute the number of ways to select consecutive students that satisfy the condition, and it writes the result to `leftmax.out`.

Let's revisit the problem and fix the solution based on a deeper examination of the requirements. We need to track subsequences where the tallest student is in the first half, and we must account for both odd and even lengths of subsequences. For each student, we need to find the furthest student to the left who is taller and count how many subsequences can be formed between these two students.

We'll adjust the strategy as follows:

1. Iterate through the list of student heights.
2. For each student, pop heights from the stack until the top of the stack is taller than the current student. As we pop each height, we calculate the number of possible subsequences ending at the popped height where the tallest student is in the first half. This is because the current student becomes the new tallest student for any subsequences that can be formed to its left.
3. Once we find a taller student or the stack is empty, we calculate the number of possible subsequences ending at the current student where the current student is the tallest. This includes subsequences of length 1 (the student itself).
4. Push the current student's height and index onto the stack.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_subsequences(heights):
    stack = []  # Stack to keep track of heights and their indices
    count = 0   # Count of valid subsequences

    # Iterate through each student's height
    for index, height in enumerate(heights):
        # Count subsequences for which this height can be the new tallest
        while stack and stack[-1][0] < height:
            _, prev_index = stack.pop()
            # The number of valid subsequences is the number of positions between the previous
            # index and the last taller student divided by 2 (for the first half)
            count += (prev_index - (stack[-1][1] if stack else -1)) // 2
            count %= MOD
        
        # Now, count subsequences ending at this student where this is the tallest
        # For subsequences of even length, the first half is considered to be one larger than the second half
        count += (index - (stack[-1][1] if stack else -1) + 1) // 2
        count %= MOD

        # Add the current height and its index to the stack
        stack.append((height, index))

    return count

# Read input data
with open('leftmax.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Write output data
with open('leftmax.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(count_subsequences(heights)))
```

This solution should now correctly compute the number of ways to select consecutive students that satisfy the condition, and it writes the result to `leftmax.out`.
