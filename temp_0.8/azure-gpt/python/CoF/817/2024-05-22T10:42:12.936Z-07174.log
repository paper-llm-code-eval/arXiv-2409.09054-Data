Un teren de fotbal este folosit pentru aterizarea elicopterelor. Gazonul de pe stadion este parcelat în pătrăţele de aceeaşi dimensiune, cu laturile paralele cu marginile terenului. Liniile cu pătrăţele de gazon sunt numerotate de sus în jos cu numerele $1, 2, \dots, m$, iar coloanele cu pătrăţele de gazon sunt numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numerele $1, 2, \dots, n$. Din cauza tipului diferit de iarbă se ştie care dintre pătrăţele de gazon sunt afectate sau nu de umbră. Acest lucru este precizat printr-un tablou bidimensional $a$ cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu elemente $0$ şi $1$ ($a_{ij} = 0$ înseamnă că pătrăţelul aflat pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$ este afectat de umbră, iar $a_{ij} = 1$ înseamnă că pătrăţelul aflat pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$ nu este afectat de umbră). Fiecare elicopter are $3$ roţi pe care se sprijină. Roţile fiecărui elicopter determină un triunghi dreptunghic isoscel. Elicopterele aterizează, astfel încât triunghiurile formate să fie cu catetele paralele cu marginile terenului. În exemplul următor avem patru elicoptere.

~[elicop.png|width=30em]

Pentru a preciza poziţia unui elicopter pe teren este suficient să cunoaştem linia şi coloana vărfurilor ipotenuzei şi poziţia vârfului deasupra (codificată prin $1$) sau dedesubtul ipotenuzei (codificată prin $-1$). Pentru exemplu, elicopterul din stânga sus este dat prin $(1, 1), (3, 3)$ şi $-1$, cel din dreapta sus prin $(1, 9), (5, 5)$ şi $1$, cel din stânga jos prin $(5, 1), (6, 2)$ şi $1$, iar cel din dreapta jos prin $(5, 9), (6, 8)$ şi $1$.
Un elicopter se consideră că a aterizat *greşit*, dacă triunghiul format sub el (definit mai sus) are mai mult de jumătate din pătrăţele afectate de umbră.
Administratorul terenului de fotbal doreşte să determine numărul $N_1$ de elicoptere, care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren şi numerele de ordine al elicopterelor, care au aterizat *greşit* în ordine crescătoare: $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$, ştiind că există $k$ elicoptere codificate prin numerele $1, 2, \dots, k$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine, pentru fişierul cu datele din enunţ: numărul de elicoptere $N_1$, care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren şi numerele de ordine al elicopterelor, care au aterizat *greşit* în ordine crescătoare, precedate de numărul lor $N_2$.

# Date de intrare


Prima linie a fişierului de intrare `elicop.in` conţine două numere naturale $m$ şi $n$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ. Următoarele $m$ linii conţin câte $n$ numere $0$ sau $1$, separate prin câte un spaţiu cu semnificaţia $0$ – pătrăţel de gazon care este afectat de umbră, respectiv $1$ - pătrăţel care nu este afectat de umbră. Pe linia $m+2$ se află numărul de elicoptere $k$, iar pe următoarele $k$ linii (în ordinea codificării lor $1, 2, \dots, k$) câte cinci numere separate prin cate un spaţiu, pentru liniile şi coloanele ipotenuzelor şi poziţia vârfului ($1$ sau $-1$), triunghiurilor dreptunghice asociate elicopterelor: $L_1 \ C_1 \ L_2 \ C_2 \ p$.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `elicop.out` va conţine două linii: prima linie numărul $N_1$ de elicoptere, pe care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren, a doua linie cu numerele naturale $N_2, e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$ separate prin câte un spaţiu, în ordine crescătoare.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* $1 \leq k \leq 40$
* Nu există suprapuneri de triunghiuri asociate la două elicoptere.
* Triunghiurile asociate elicopterelor conţin cel puţin trei pătrăţele.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a valorilor $N_1$ se obţine $40$% din punctajul unui test, iar pentru determinarea corectă a valorilor $N_2, e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$ se obţine $60$% din punctajul unui test.

    if p == 1:
        start_row, start_col = L1, C1
        end_row, end_col = L2, C2
    else:
        start_row, start_col = L2, C2
        end_row, end_col = L1, C1
    for i in range(0, abs(end_row - start_row)):

```

This code reads the input from `elicop.in`, processes the helicopters' positions to find the ones that landed correctly and which ones landed wrong, then writes the output to `elicop.out`. The `solve` function calculates the result by checking every helicopter according to the rules given in the challenge.

The error indicates that there was an attempt to access an index of the grid that was out of range. This is likely due to not correctly calculating the indices of the squares under the helicopter's triangle. To account for the possibility that the triangle's coordinates could be out of bounds, we need to add checks to ensure that we only consider valid indices.

Here is the corrected solution with additional checks for index bounds:

```python
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return m, n, grid, helicopters

def write_output(file_path, N1, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        file.write(" ".join(map(str, [len(wrong_helicopters)] + wrong_helicopters)) + "\n")

def check_helicopter(grid, helicopter):
    L1, C1, L2, C2, p = helicopter
    affected = total_squares = 0
    side_length = abs(L2 - L1)
    
    for i in range(side_length + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            row = L1 + i * (1 if p == 1 else -1) - 1
            col = C1 + j * (1 if p == 1 else -1) - 1
            if 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0]):
                total_squares += 1
                if grid[row][col] == 0:
                    affected += 1
    return affected, total_squares

def solve(grid, helicopters):
    N1 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []
    for idx, helicopter in enumerate(helicopters, 1):
        affected, total_squares = check_helicopter(grid, helicopter)
        if affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        elif affected * 2 > total_squares:
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)
    return N1, wrong_helicopters

def main():
    m, n, grid, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1, wrong_helicopters = solve(grid, helicopters)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution includes a `check_helicopter` function that ensures the indices it checks are within the bounds of the grid. The output is written to `elicop.out` as specified, including the number of helicopters that did not affect any squares and, on a new line, the number of helicopters that landed incorrectly followed by their indices in ascending order.

It seems that the current implementation is not calculating the indices for the helicopter's landing position correctly. Also, the implementation of the `check_helicopter` function is not accurate in considering the position of the triangle relative to the hypotenuse, and it should check more than half the squares being affected instead of any affected squares for an incorrect landing.

Let's rewrite the solution to:

1. Fix the calculation of the indices for the helicopter's landing position.
2. Correctly identify helicopters that landed incorrectly by checking if more than half of the squares under the helicopter's triangle are affected by shadow.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return m, n, grid, helicopters

def write_output(file_path, N1, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")

def check_helicopter(m, n, grid, helicopter):
    L1, C1, L2, C2, p = helicopter
    affected = total = 0
    # Determine the orientation and start point of the helicopter
    if p == -1:
        drow, dcol = 1, 1
        srow, scol = L1 - 1, C1 - 1
    else:
        drow, dcol = -1, -1
        srow, scol = L2 - 1, C2 - 1
    
    # Calculate the length of the sides of the triangle
    side_length = abs(L1 - L2)
    
    # Iterate over the triangle area
    for i in range(side_length):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            row, col = srow + i * drow, scol + j * dcol
            if grid[row][col] == 0:
                affected += 1
            total += 1
    
    return affected, total

def solve(m, n, grid, helicopters):
    N1 = N2 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []
    for idx, helicopter in enumerate(helicopters, 1):
        affected, total = check_helicopter(m, n, grid, helicopter)
        if total > 0 and affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        if affected > total // 2:
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)
    return N1, wrong_helicopters

def main():
    m, n, grid, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1, wrong_helicopters = solve(m, n, grid, helicopters)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution should handle the calculations correctly and provide the expected results for both $N_1$ and the sequence $N_2, e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$. The `check_helicopter` function now considers the proper orientation and counts the affected squares only within the triangle area. The `solve` function uses this information to determine the number of helicopters that did not affect any squares and those that landed incorrectly.

The previous solution did not correctly address the logic for determining if a helicopter landed incorrectly. The condition used to determine an incorrect landing was based on whether the number of affected squares was greater than the total number of squares divided by two. However, the task specifies that a helicopter has landed incorrectly if more than half of the squares beneath it are affected by shadow. Additionally, the expected output indicates that helicopters 1 and 3 landed incorrectly, while my previous output only marked helicopter 1 as such.

Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the program properly evaluates whether a helicopter has landed incorrectly based on the task's requirements.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return m, n, grid, helicopters

def write_output(file_path, N1, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        if wrong_helicopters:
            file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")
        else:
            file.write("0\n")

def solve(m, n, grid, helicopters):
    N1 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []
    for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, 1):
        # Determine the orientation and correct the positions
        dx = 1 if C2 > C1 else -1
        if p == -1:
            L1 -= 1
        else:
            L2 -= 1
            C2 -= 1
            dx *= -1
        
        # Calculate the total and affected squares
        affected = total = 0
        side_length = abs(L2 - L1) + 1
        for i in range(side_length):
            for j in range(i + 1):
                row = L1 + i * p
                col = C1 + j * dx
                total += 1
                if grid[row][col] == 0:  # Affected by shadow
                    affected += 1
        
        # Check if any squares are unaffected
        if affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        # Check if more than half the squares are affected
        if affected * 2 > total:
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)
    
    return N1, wrong_helicopters

def main():
    m, n, grid, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1, wrong_helicopters = solve(m, n, grid, helicopters)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should now correctly identify the helicopters that landed correctly (N1) and those that landed incorrectly (wrong_helicopters), adhering to the task's definition of a correct and incorrect landing. The output will include a count of helicopters that did not affect any squares (N1) and, on the next line, the number of helicopters that landed incorrectly followed by their identifiers in ascending order.

The error "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the code is attempting to access an index of the `grid` that does not exist. This can happen if the calculated row and column indices for the helicopter's triangle go out of the bounds of the `grid`. To fix this, we should ensure that we only iterate over the rows and columns that are within the bounds of the field.

Let's update the solution to correctly handle the bounds of the grid when checking the positions of the helicopters:

```python
def read_input(file_path):

                if grid[cur_y][cur_x] == 0:
                    affected += 1
                else:
                    unshadowed += 1

This updated solution includes bounds checking in the `check_helicopter` function to prevent out-of-range errors. It also correctly iterates over the triangle area defined by each helicopter's coordinates, considering the orientation of the triangles. The `solve` function identifies helicopters that landed without affecting any squares and those that landed incorrectly based on the criteria given in the task. The output will include the number of helicopters that did not affect any squares (N1) and the number of helicopters that landed incorrectly, followed by their identifiers in ascending order.

The previous code still doesn't produce the correct output because the logic in the `check_helicopter` function is incorrect. The condition for an incorrect landing should be that more than half of the squares under the helicopter's triangle are affected by the shadow, not just any squares.

The following solution should fix the problem. I have corrected the logic for counting affected and unshadowed squares within the triangle region:

```python
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return m, n, grid, helicopters

def write_output(file_path, N1, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)}{' ' if wrong_helicopters else ''}{' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")

def check_helicopter(m, n, grid, helicopter):
    L1, C1, L2, C2, p = helicopter
    shadow_count = 0
    square_count = 0

    # Correct the start and end points based on p value
    if p == 1:
        start_x, start_y = C1 - 1, L1 - 1
        end_x = C2 - 1
    else:
        start_x, start_y = C2 - 1, L2 - 1
        end_x = C1 - 1

    # Calculate the size of the triangle
    size = abs(start_x - end_x) + 1

    # Count the affected and total squares
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            x = start_x + j * (1 if start_x < end_x else -1)
            y = start_y + i * (1 if p == 1 else -1)
            if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m:  # Ensure we are within grid bounds
                square_count += 1
                if grid[y][x] == 0:
                    shadow_count += 1

    # Check if the triangle has more than half squares in shadow
    return (2 * shadow_count > square_count), (shadow_count == 0)

def solve(m, n, grid, helicopters):
    N1 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []
    for idx, helicopter in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
        wrong_landed, no_shadow = check_helicopter(m, n, grid, helicopter)
        if no_shadow:
            N1 += 1
        elif wrong_landed:
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)
    return N1, wrong_helicopters

def main():
    m, n, grid, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1, wrong_helicopters = solve(m, n, grid, helicopters)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The updated solution carefully checks each square within the triangle's bounds to determine whether it's affected by shadow. It counts the total number of squares and the number of shadowed squares. If more than half of the squares are shadowed, the helicopter is considered to have landed incorrectly. If there are no shadowed squares, the helicopter is considered to have not affected any square. The corrected logic should now produce the expected output.

It appears that the previous solution still has a logical error in determining helicopters that landed incorrectly. The determination of the helicopter's triangle position and affected squares by the shadow is still not being handled correctly. Let's revise the solution to properly account for these cases.

This time we'll correctly calculate the bounds and iterate over the triangle in the correct order, ensuring that we identify helicopters landing incorrectly when more than half of their squares are affected by the shadow:

```python
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return m, n, grid, helicopters

def write_output(file_path, N1, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)}{' ' if wrong_helicopters else ''}{' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")

def count_affected_squares(m, n, grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p):
    affected = 0
    not_affected = 0
    size = abs(L1 - L2) + 1
    
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            x = C1 - 1 + (j if L1 < L2 else -j)
            y = L1 - 1 + (i if p == -1 else -i)
            if 0 <= y < m and 0 <= x < n:
                if grid[y][x] == 0:
                    affected += 1
                else:
                    not_affected += 1
    return affected, not_affected

def solve(m, n, grid, helicopters):
    N1 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []
    for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
        affected, not_affected = count_affected_squares(m, n, grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p)
        total = affected + not_affected
        if affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        elif affected > total // 2:
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)
    return N1, wrong_helicopters

def main():
    m, n, grid, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1, wrong_helicopters = solve(m, n, grid, helicopters)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this correction, the `count_affected_squares` function accounts for the placement of the helicopter's triangle and counts the affected and not-affected squares. The solve function then uses these counts to determine whether the helicopter landed correctly or incorrectly. The output is written to 'elicop.out' as specified. This version should meet the challenge specifications and provide the expected output.
