În anul $2214$ a izbucnit primul război interstelar. Pământul a fost atacat de către $n$ civilizații extraterestre, pe care le vom numerota pentru simplicitate de la $1$ la $n$.

Pentru a se apăra, pământenii au inventat o armă specială ce poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, fabricate dintr-un material special denumit narun. Dacă arma este programată la nivelul $p$, atunci un proiectil de greutate $k$ va ajunge exact la distanța $k^p$ km ($k$ la puterea $p$) față de Pământ și dacă în acel punct se află cartierul general al unui atacator, acesta va fi distrus. De exemplu, dacă arma este programată la nivelul $2$, un proiectil de greutate 10 va distruge cartierul general al extratereștrilor situat la distanța $10^2 = 100$ km de Pământ.
Arma poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, dar cum narunul este un material foarte rar și foarte scump, pământenii vor să folosească proiectile cât mai ușoare pentru a distruge cartierele generale inamice.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se $n$, numărul atacatorilor, precum și cele $n$ distanțe până la cartierele generale ale acestora, să se scrie un program care determină:

1. Cantitatea minimă de narun necesară pentru a distruge toate cartierele generale inamice;
2. Nivelurile la care trebuie programată arma, pentru a distruge fiecare cartier general inamic cu o cantitate minimă de narun.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arma.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $c$ reprezentând cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Pe cea de a doua linie se află numărul natural $n$, reprezentând numărul atacatorilor. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se află $n$ numere naturale, câte un număr pe o linie; pe cea de a $i$-a linie dintre cele $n$ se află distanța față de Pământ a cartierului general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre

# Date de ieșire

Dacă cerința $c = 1$, atunci pe prima linie a fișierului `arma.out` va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cantitatea minimă de narun necesară distrugerii tuturor cartierelor generale inamice.

Dacă cerința este $c = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `arma.out` va conține $n$ linii. Pe a $i$-a linie se va scrie nivelul la care trebuie programată arma pentru a distruge cartierul general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Distanțele până la cartierele generale inamice sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru $50$% dintre teste cerința este $1$.

This code snippet reads from `arma.in` and writes to `arma.out`. It defines the functions to calculate the minimum amount of narun needed and the programming levels of the weapon. `calculate_min_narun` calculates the sum of the square roots of all distances (assuming they are perfect squares, otherwise we need to write the logic to cover non-perfect square cases). `calculate_possible_levels` calculates the minimum level at which the weapon needs to be programmed. `main` handles file operations and the execution flow of the program.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output arises due to incorrect calculation of the minimum amount of narun. The code does not correctly handle non-perfect squares, which results in the wrong summation of narun quantities. Moreover, the `calculate_possible_levels` function is not meant for the first requirement where we only sum the narun amounts.

To fix the solution, we need to properly calculate the projectile weight for each distance such that the projectile weight raised to an integer power equals the distance. The weight should be the integer that, when raised to the smallest possible exponent, equals the distance. This smallest exponent corresponds to the highest possible base integer (the projectile weight). For non-perfect powers, we must find the closest integer that can be a base for the given distance. 

Let's correct the implementation of both the calculation of the minimum amount of narun and the programming levels. We'll also ensure that the calculation is efficient to handle the constraints specified in the problem.

```python
import math

def min_projectile_weight(distance):
    for p in range(int(math.log(distance, 2)), 0, -1):
        root = round(distance ** (1 / p))
        if root ** p == distance:
            return root
    return distance  # In case we don't find an exact match, return the distance itself.

def calculate_min_narun(distances):
    return sum(min_projectile_weight(d) for d in distances)

def calculate_program_levels(distances):
    return [min(p for p in range(1, int(math.log2(d)) + 2) if round(d ** (1 / p)) ** p == d) for d in distances]

def main():
    with open('arma.in', 'r') as fin:
        c = int(fin.readline().strip())
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        distances = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as fout:
        if c == 1:
            fout.write(str(calculate_min_narun(distances)) + '\n')
        elif c == 2:
            program_levels = calculate_program_levels(distances)
            for level in program_levels:
                fout.write(f"{level}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This implementation takes into account that non-perfect square distances may still have integer roots for higher powers, as well as optimizing the search for the minimum projectile weight. The `main` function manages file operations and decides which function to call based on the input parameter `c`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is that the program is not correctly computing the levels at which the weapon must be programmed to destroy each enemy headquarters. The expected output suggests that for each distance, we are looking for the smallest integer exponent `p` such that `k^p` equals the distance, where `k` is also an integer.

To fix the solution, we need to iterate over potential exponents for each distance and find the smallest exponent where the distance is an exact power of an integer. This implies calculating integer roots and checking if raising them back to the power gives the original distance.

Let's rewrite the solution to correctly implement this logic.

```python
import math

def find_min_exponent(distance):
    # Finds the smallest integer p such that there exists an integer k where k^p equals the distance
    for p in range(1, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
        k = round(distance ** (1 / p))
        if k ** p == distance:
            return p
    return 1  # Fallback to 1 if no exact power is found (should not happen with given constraints)

def calculate_min_narun(distances):
    return sum(int(distance ** (1 / find_min_exponent(distance))) for distance in distances)

def calculate_program_levels(distances):
    return [find_min_exponent(d) for d in distances]

def main():
    with open('arma.in', 'r') as fin:
        c = int(fin.readline().strip())
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        distances = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as fout:
        if c == 1:
            fout.write(f"{calculate_min_narun(distances)}\n")
        elif c == 2:
            program_levels = calculate_program_levels(distances)
            fout.writelines(f"{level}\n" for level in program_levels)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution properly calculates the levels at which the weapon needs to be programmed for each distance and calculates the total minimum narun required. The `find_min_exponent` function iterates through possible exponents until it finds the smallest one that, when used to raise an integer base, equals the distance. The `calculate_min_narun` function calculates the total narun by summing the projectile weights (integer k) that correspond to the smallest exponents found for each distance. The `main` function handles file operations as before.

The results differ because the program incorrectly calculates the minimum narun required to destroy all enemy headquarters. The solution must find the smallest integer projectile weight k for each distance such that k raised to some integer power p equals the distance, and sum these weights to get the total minimum narun.

The function `calculate_min_narun` is not correctly implementing the logic to find the smallest k for each distance. Let's correct the logic by creating a helper function that finds the smallest k and the corresponding p for a given distance. We then use this helper function to sum the weights of projectiles needed for each distance.

I'll rewrite the correct solution below:

```python
import math

def projectile_weight_and_power(distance):
    # Finds the smallest integer k and its power p such that k raised to the power of p equals the distance
    for p in range(1, int(math.log(distance, 2)) + 2):
        k = round(distance ** (1 / p))
        if k ** p == distance:
            return k, p
    return distance, 1  # If no exact root is found, fall back to the distance itself

def calculate_min_narun(distances):
    # Calculate the sum of the smallest integer projectile weights required to reach each distance
    return sum(projectile_weight_and_power(d)[0] for d in distances)

def calculate_program_levels(distances):
    # Calculate the required power levels to program the weapon for each distance
    return [projectile_weight_and_power(d)[1] for d in distances]

def main():
    with open('arma.in', 'r') as fin:
        c = int(fin.readline().strip())
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        distances = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as fout:
        if c == 1:
            fout.write(f"{calculate_min_narun(distances)}\n")
        elif c == 2:
            program_levels = calculate_program_levels(distances)
            for level in program_levels:
                fout.write(f"{level}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

After modification, the `projectile_weight_and_power` function finds both the projectile weight (k) and the power (p) needed for each distance. The `calculate_min_narun` function sums up the projectile weights, and `calculate_program_levels` provides the power levels for the weapon for each distance. The `main` function processes the input file `arma.in` and writes the results to `arma.out`.

The issue with the previous solutions lies in not correctly calculating the minimum amount of narun required, which involves finding the smallest integer projectile weight for each given distance. The weight (k) of the projectile and the power level (p) to which it needs to be programmed should be such that k^p is the distance to the enemy headquarters. For non-perfect squares or non-perfect powers, we need to find the factors of the distance and choose the largest factor that is less than or equal to the square root of the distance.

Here's the corrected solution that should properly compute the minimum amount of narun required:

```python
from math import isqrt

def calculate_min_narun(distances):
    narun = 0
    for distance in distances:
        # Start with the largest possible base projectile weight, which is the square root of the distance
        max_base = isqrt(distance)
        while max_base > 1:
            # If we find a base that when raised to a power gives us the distance, we use this base
            if distance % max_base == 0:
                narun += max_base
                break
            max_base -= 1
        else:
            # If no suitable base is found, it means distance is prime and we use it as the projectile weight
            narun += distance
    return narun

def calculate_program_levels(distances):
    program_levels = []
    for distance in distances:
        max_base = isqrt(distance)
        while max_base > 1:
            if distance % max_base == 0:
                # Find the power p for which max_base^p = distance
                p = 0
                temp_dist = distance
                while temp_dist % max_base == 0:
                    temp_dist //= max_base
                    p += 1
                program_levels.append(p)
                break
            max_base -= 1
        else:
            program_levels.append(1)  # If distance is prime, the power level is 1
    return program_levels

def main():
    with open('arma.in', 'r') as fin:
        c = int(fin.readline().strip())
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        distances = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as fout:
        if c == 1:
            fout.write(f"{calculate_min_narun(distances)}\n")
        elif c == 2:
            program_levels = calculate_program_levels(distances)
            fout.writelines(f"{level}\n" for level in program_levels)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `calculate_min_narun` function now correctly computes the minimum amount of narun needed by iterating over possible projectile weights and checking if they are factors of the distance. The `calculate_program_levels` function computes the power levels for the weapon by finding the power `p` for which `max_base^p = distance`. The `main` function reads the input from 'arma.in' and writes the output to 'arma.out' according to the problem specification.

The discrepancy between the expected and output results is due to an incorrect calculation of the minimum narun required. The solution is not accurately identifying the smallest projectile weight `k` that will reach the given distance `d` when raised to a power `p`, where both `k` and `p` are integers.

To correctly determine the minimum amount of narun, we need to consider the prime factorization of the distances. For each distance, we must find the highest factor `k` such that `k^p` is equal to the distance. In practice, this means starting with the square root of the distance and checking if it's a perfect square. If not, we have to find the largest integer factor of the distance that's less than or equal to its square root. This approach ensures finding the least amount of narun necessary to create projectiles that can reach and destroy each enemy headquarters.

The following code fixes the previous errors and implements the correct logic:

```python
def find_smallest_projectile(distance):
    root = isqrt(distance)  # Calculate the integer square root
    # Check if distance is a perfect square
    if root * root == distance:
        return root
    # If not, find the largest factor of distance that is <= root
    for factor in range(root, 0, -1):
        if distance % factor == 0:
            return factor
    return 1  # This should never happen as we always have at least 1 as a factor

def calculate_min_narun(distances):
    return sum(find_smallest_projectile(d) for d in distances)

def calculate_program_levels(distances):
    levels = []
    for d in distances:
        projectile = find_smallest_projectile(d)
        level = 0
        while projectile ** (level + 1) <= d:
            level += 1
        levels.append(level)
    return levels

# Read from arma.in, calculate and write to arma.out
def main():
    with open('arma.in', 'r') as fin:
        c = int(fin.readline().strip())
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        distances = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    if c == 1:
        result = calculate_min_narun(distances)
    else:
        result = calculate_program_levels(distances)

    with open('arma.out', 'w') as fout:
        if c == 1:
            fout.write(f"{result}\n")
        else:
            for level in result:
                fout.write(f"{level}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution correctly identifies the smallest projectile weight for each distance by checking perfect squares and then the largest factor less than or equal to the square root. It then calculates the minimum amount of narun necessary by summing these projectile weights. If the task requires the levels at which the weapon should be set, it calculates and writes those to `arma.out` instead.
