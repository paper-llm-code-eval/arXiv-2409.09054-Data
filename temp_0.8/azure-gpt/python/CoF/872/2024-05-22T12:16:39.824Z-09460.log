În anul $2214$ a izbucnit primul război interstelar. Pământul a fost atacat de către $n$ civilizații extraterestre, pe care le vom numerota pentru simplicitate de la $1$ la $n$.

Pentru a se apăra, pământenii au inventat o armă specială ce poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, fabricate dintr-un material special denumit narun. Dacă arma este programată la nivelul $p$, atunci un proiectil de greutate $k$ va ajunge exact la distanța $k^p$ km ($k$ la puterea $p$) față de Pământ și dacă în acel punct se află cartierul general al unui atacator, acesta va fi distrus. De exemplu, dacă arma este programată la nivelul $2$, un proiectil de greutate 10 va distruge cartierul general al extratereștrilor situat la distanța $10^2 = 100$ km de Pământ.
Arma poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, dar cum narunul este un material foarte rar și foarte scump, pământenii vor să folosească proiectile cât mai ușoare pentru a distruge cartierele generale inamice.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se $n$, numărul atacatorilor, precum și cele $n$ distanțe până la cartierele generale ale acestora, să se scrie un program care determină:

1. Cantitatea minimă de narun necesară pentru a distruge toate cartierele generale inamice;
2. Nivelurile la care trebuie programată arma, pentru a distruge fiecare cartier general inamic cu o cantitate minimă de narun.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arma.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $c$ reprezentând cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Pe cea de a doua linie se află numărul natural $n$, reprezentând numărul atacatorilor. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se află $n$ numere naturale, câte un număr pe o linie; pe cea de a $i$-a linie dintre cele $n$ se află distanța față de Pământ a cartierului general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre

# Date de ieșire

Dacă cerința $c = 1$, atunci pe prima linie a fișierului `arma.out` va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cantitatea minimă de narun necesară distrugerii tuturor cartierelor generale inamice.

Dacă cerința este $c = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `arma.out` va conține $n$ linii. Pe a $i$-a linie se va scrie nivelul la care trebuie programată arma pentru a distruge cartierul general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Distanțele până la cartierele generale inamice sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru $50$% dintre teste cerința este $1$.

The original implementation incorrectly calculates the sum of the minimum narun weights for all distances when `task == 1`. The correct approach is to find the smallest projectile weight (narun weight) that can reach each specified distance when fired at the correct power level. Since the goal is to minimize the total use of narun, we need to optimize this process.

The bug occurs because the algorithm does not correctly handle cases where the distance cannot be represented as an exact power of an integer. In the given example, the distance `97` cannot be represented as `k^p` for integer values of `k` and `p`. Hence, we need a method to check for the exactness of the root.

A correct implementation would involve checking the integer part of the root and ensuring that when it's raised to the power `p`, it equals the original distance. We will also limit `p` by the highest integer that a distance value can be raised to without exceeding the given distance, which is the integer part of the logarithm base 2 of the distance plus 1.

Let's implement these changes to the solution.

```python
import math

# Helper function to check if the root is an integer
def is_power(dist, root):
    power = int(round(dist ** (1 / root)))
    return power ** root == dist, power

# Function to calculate the minimal weight required
def min_weight(distances):
    min_narun = 0
    for distance in distances:
        for p in range(1, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
            valid, k = is_power(distance, p)
            if valid:
                min_narun += k
                break
    return min_narun

# Function to calculate the levels
def calculate_levels(distances):
    levels = []
    for distance in distances:
        for p in range(1, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
            valid, k = is_power(distance, p)
            if valid:
                levels.append(p)
                break
    return levels

# Read from 'arma.in'
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Solve the task
if task == 1:
    result = min_weight(distances)
elif task == 2:
    result = calculate_levels(distances)

# Write to 'arma.out'
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if task == 1:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
    elif task == 2:
        for level in result:
            file.write(f"{level}\n")
```

This updated solution should now handle all cases correctly. When calculating the total weight of narun, it only adds up the weights of projectiles that can be squared to the exact distances of the enemy headquarters. When calculating the levels, it only includes those levels for which a projectile can be exactly squared to reach the target.

Upon reviewing the previous code and the expected output, the issue arises from not correctly identifying the least value of `k` for which `k^p` equals the given distance. To find the correct `k` for every distance, one must check every possible `p` starting from 1 and increase until `k` no longer remains an integer. For each `p`, we need to check if `k` is an integer and `k^p` is exactly equal to the distance.

The expected output suggests that a brute-force method might be necessary to handle cases where the distance is not a perfect power of an integer. 

Let's implement a solution that goes through each potential power `p`, from 1 upwards, checking for the smallest integer root `k` where `k^p` equals the target distance - which would be a correct projectile weight to destroy the headquarters at that distance.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
from math import log

def find_min_narun_and_levels(distances):
    min_narun = 0
    levels = []
    
    for distance in distances:
        for p in range(1, int(log(distance, 2)) + 2):  # Start from 1 and go up to log2(distance)
            k = round(distance ** (1 / p))
            if k ** p == distance:
                min_narun += k  # Add the projectile weight
                levels.append(p)  # Add the power level
                break
    
    return min_narun, levels

# Read input data from 'arma.in'
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Process the input data
min_narun, levels = find_min_narun_and_levels(distances)

# Write output data to 'arma.out'
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if task == 1:
        file.write(f"{min_narun}\n")  # Only write the total narun weight for task 1
    elif task == 2:
        file.writelines(f"{level}\n" for level in levels)  # Write all the levels for task 2
```

This solution will correctly identify the minimum narun weight required as well as the level for each distance. For the given input, it should output the expected result.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to incorrect calculation of the minimum projectile weights (narun). In the given input example, distance `97` cannot be represented as `k^p` for any integer values of `k` and `p`. Therefore, our approach should explicitly check for such cases and handle them correctly.

To address this, we need to ensure that we are only including weights (narun) for distances that can be represented as a perfect power. The calculation should involve iterating over potential powers `p` in a manner that accounts for floating-point precision issues, which can occur when calculating roots and powers with non-integer values.

Let's write the corrected solution, which includes the handling of such precision issues.

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is a perfect power for a given base
def is_perfect_power(base, power):
    # Calculate the power
    result = base ** power
    # Check if the result is an integer and equal to the given number
    return result.is_integer(), int(result)

# Function to find the minimum projectile weight for a given distance
def min_projectile_weight(distance):
    # Iterate over potential powers, starting from 2
    for p in range(2, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
        # Calculate the pth root of the distance and check if it's an integer
        root = distance ** (1 / p)
        k = round(root)
        # Check if the rounded value, when raised to power p, equals the distance
        if k ** p == distance:
            return k  # Return the weight of the projectile
    # If no perfect power is found, return the distance itself
    return distance

# Read from 'arma.in'
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the total minimum projectile weight for task 1
if task == 1:
    total_weight = sum(min_projectile_weight(distance) for distance in distances)

# Calculate the required power level for each distance for task 2
elif task == 2:
    levels = [min_projectile_weight(distance) for distance in distances]

# Write to 'arma.out'
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if task == 1:
        file.write(f"{total_weight}\n")
    elif task == 2:
        file.writelines(f"{level}\n" for level in levels)
```

In this solution, the `min_projectile_weight` function finds the minimum projectile weight by trying different powers `p` until it finds one that matches the distance or until it exhausts all possible powers. If no perfect power is found, it returns the distance itself as the projectile weight (as per the task requirement). For task 1, it sums these minimum weights to find the total weight. For task 2, it simply returns the found power levels.

The differences between the expected and found result stem from an incorrect approach to finding the minimum narun weight required for each distance. The solution must extract the root of each distance value and determine the power level for which the root, when raised to that power, matches the distance exactly. However, the previous solutions do not handle cases where no such integer root and power level exists (e.g., distance `97`).

A correct approach would involve finding the greatest integer `k` such that `k^p` is less than or equal to the distance for some integer power `p`. The minimum narun weight is the sum of these `k` values for each distance.

Let's rewrite the solution, applying a correct algorithm to find the minimum narun weight:

```python
import math

# Helper function to find the minimum narun weight for a given distance
def find_minimum_narun(distance):
    for p in range(int(math.log(distance, 2)), 0, -1):  # Start at the largest potential p
        k = int(math.pow(distance, 1 / p))  # Extract the p-th root
        if k**p == distance:  # Check if it is a perfect power
            return k  # Return the weight of the projectile
    return 1  # If no exact power found, return 1 as the weight (lowest possible)

# Read from 'arma.in'
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Solve the task
if task == 1:
    # Task 1: Calculate the sum of minimum narun weights
    total_narun = sum(find_minimum_narun(distance) for distance in distances)
    result = total_narun
elif task == 2:
    # Task 2: Find the p level for each distance
    levels = [find_minimum_narun(distance) for distance in distances]
    result = levels

# Write to 'arma.out'
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if task == 1:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
    elif task == 2:
        for level in result:
            file.write(f"{level}\n")
```

This solution first checks if the distance is a perfect power of some integer; if not, it returns 1 (the minimum possible narun weight). For each distance, it calculates its minimum narun weight and sums them up for task 1. For task 2, it calculates the corresponding level (power `p`) for each distance.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found result is due to a misunderstanding of the problem statement. We need to find the smallest integer k for any given distance that can be represented as k raised to some integer power p to match the distance exactly. If no such k and p exist (meaning the distance is not a perfect power), then no narun projectile can be used to target that distance. Thus, we should not add 1 as the minimum narun weight for distances that are not perfect powers.

Let's fix the solution with the correct understanding of the problem. We will loop over the possible values of p in descending order and find the integer k that, when raised to p, is equal to the given distance. If no such k and p are found, we will skip adding any weight for that distance.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import math

# Function to find the minimum projectile weight for a given distance
def find_min_projectile_weight(distance):
    if distance == 1:
        return 1, 1
    for p in range(2, int(math.log2(distance)) + 1):
        k = round(distance ** (1 / p))
        if k ** p == distance:
            return k, p
    return None

# Read from 'arma.in'
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Solve the task
if task == 1:
    total_weight = 0
    for distance in distances:
        result = find_min_projectile_weight(distance)
        if result is not None:
            k, _ = result
            total_weight += k
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{total_weight}\n")
elif task == 2:
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
        for distance in distances:
            result = find_min_projectile_weight(distance)
            if result is not None:
                _, p = result
                file.write(f"{p}\n")
            else:
                file.write(f"0\n") # If no k and p exist, write 0 for the level
```

This solution should correctly identify the minimum narun weight required as well as the power level for each distance. For task 1, it only adds up the weights of projectiles that can be squared to the exact distances of the enemy headquarters. For task 2, it lists the corresponding power levels or 0 if no such power exists. For the given input, it should output the expected result of `122`.
