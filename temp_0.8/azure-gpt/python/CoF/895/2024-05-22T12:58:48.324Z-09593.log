Într-un laborator cibernetic se fac experimente cu roboți. Pe o bandă de lucru se află așezate unul lângă altul, $N$ cuburi galbene și albastre, numeroate în ordine cu valori de la $1$ la $N$. Pentru fiecare cub se cunoaște latura acestuia, exprimată în centimetri, și culoarea, codificată prin simbolul $g$ (pentru galben) sau $a$ (pentru albastru).


~[turnuri-1.png|align=right|width=30%]

Un robot inteligent este programat să construiască turnuri prin așezarea cuburilor unul peste altul. El se află în fața benzii de lucru, analizează fiecare cub în ordine, de la primul la ultimul, și procedează astfel:
* dacă este primul cub, îl lasă la locul lui pe bandă;
* așază cubul numerotat cu $K$ peste cubul numerotat cu $K-1$ doar dacă el are culoarea diferită și latura mai mică decât cubul $K-1$. Această operație se efectuează în cazul în care cubul $K-1$ se află deja într-un turn construit anterior sau dacă el a rămas în poziția inițială. În cazul în care cubul $K$ nu poate fi așezat peste cubul $K-1$, el rămâne la locul lui.


# Cerință

Știind că un turn poate fi format din cel puțin un cub, scrieți un program care să determine:

1. numărul final $T$ al turnurilor de pe bandă și $H$, înălțimea celui mai înalt turn care se poate forma, exprimată în centimetri;
2. cel mai mare număr de cuburi Nmax ce pot forma un turn, dacă cele $N$ cuburi ar putea fi rearanjate inițial pe bandă, unul lângă altul.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `turnuri.in` conține:

* pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ care reprezintă numărul cerinței și poate fi $1$ sau $2$.
* pe cea de-a doua linie un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă numărul cuburilor de pe bandă;
* pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii, câte un număr natural care reprezintă latura unui cub, urmat de un spațiu și simbolul $g$ sau $a$, pentru codificarea culorii cubului.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `turnuri.out` va conține pentru cerința $1$ pe prima linie două valori, separate printr-un spațiu, ce reprezintă $T$ și $H$. Pentru cerința $2$ fișierul va conține pe prima linie numărul $Nmax$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$ și $1 \leq$ latura unui cub $\leq 500 \ 000$;
* nu există două cuburi cu laturi egale;
* se acordă $10$ puncte din oficiu. Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe se acordă $30$ de puncte, pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de-a doua cerințe se acordă $60$ de puncte.

Upon reviewing the provided solution, it appears there is a flaw in the logic of `solve_cerinta_2`. This function is intended to determine the longest alternating sequence of blocks with decreasing sizes, irrespective of their initial positions on the band. However, the current solution pops from the sorted lists of yellow and blue blocks incorrectly because it does not consider that after placing a block of a certain color, the next block must be of the opposite color and also smaller than the last placed block. Additionally, the solution fails to account for the condition that blocks must alternate in color when forming a tower.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def solve_cerinta_1(blocks):
    T, H, current_height = 1, 0, 0
    last_block_size, last_block_color = blocks[0]
    current_height += last_block_size

    for i in range(1, len(blocks)):
        block_size, block_color = blocks[i]
        if block_size < last_block_size and block_color != last_block_color:
            current_height += block_size
            last_block_size, last_block_color = block_size, block_color
        else:
            T += 1
            H = max(H, current_height)
            last_block_size, last_block_color = block_size, block_color
            current_height = block_size
            
    H = max(H, current_height)  # Check last tower height

    return T, H

def solve_cerinta_2(blocks):
    # Create two lists for each color with the block sizes, then sort them in descending order
    blocks_g = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'g'), reverse=True)
    blocks_a = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'a'), reverse=True)
    Nmax = 0
    last_block_size = float('inf')
    last_block_color = 'g'  # Initialize with opposite color so the first block can be blue or yellow

    # Loop until there are no more blocks in one of the lists
    while blocks_g and blocks_a:
        # Find and place the next block of the opposite color that is smaller than the last placed block
        if last_block_color == 'g':
            while blocks_a and blocks_a[-1] >= last_block_size:
                blocks_a.pop()
            if blocks_a:
                last_block_size = blocks_a.pop()
                last_block_color = 'a'
                Nmax += 1
        else:
            while blocks_g and blocks_g[-1] >= last_block_size:
                blocks_g.pop()
            if blocks_g:
                last_block_size = blocks_g.pop()
                last_block_color = 'g'
                Nmax += 1

    return Nmax

with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    blocks = [(int(line.split()[0]), line.strip().split()[1]) for line in f]

result = solve_cerinta_1(blocks) if C == 1 else solve_cerinta_2(blocks)

with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
    if C == 1:
        f.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
    else:
        f.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This corrected solution ensures that a block of the opposite color and smaller size is added to the tower, which aligns with the challenge's requirements. It also ensures that the algorithm continues to look for a smaller block if the next block is not smaller than the last placed block. This should output the correct result for cerința 2 (requirement 2).

There is indeed a bug in the previous implementation of `solve_cerinta_2`. The function is not correctly simulating the process of building the highest possible tower by alternating between the two colors. The popping of elements from the sorted lists `blocks_g` and `blocks_a` does not guarantee that we are building the tallest possible tower, because it does not keep track of the available blocks that could be placed next in the sequence.

To fix this, we need to iterate through both sorted lists and always choose the largest available block of the alternating color that is smaller than the last block added to the tower. The previous implementation failed to do this, which led to incorrect results.

Let's rewrite the `solve_cerinta_2` function with the correct logic:

```python
def solve_cerinta_2(blocks):
    # Create two lists for each color with the block sizes, then sort them in descending order
    blocks_g = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'g'), reverse=True)
    blocks_a = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'a'), reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize the maximum number of blocks in a tower
    Nmax = 0
    # Track the last block size and color
    last_block_size = float('inf')
    last_block_color = 'a'  # Start with 'a' so the first block in the tower is 'g'
    
    # Continue building the tower until there are no more blocks to place
    while blocks_g or blocks_a:
        # Find the next largest block of the opposite color that is smaller than the last
        if last_block_color == 'a' and blocks_g:
            for i in range(len(blocks_g)):
                if blocks_g[i] < last_block_size:
                    last_block_size = blocks_g.pop(i)
                    last_block_color = 'g'
                    Nmax += 1
                    break
        elif last_block_color == 'g' and blocks_a:
            for i in range(len(blocks_a)):
                if blocks_a[i] < last_block_size:
                    last_block_size = blocks_a.pop(i)
                    last_block_color = 'a'
                    Nmax += 1
                    break
        
        # If no block could be placed, break the loop
        if last_block_size == float('inf'):
            break
        
        # Reset the last_block_size for the next iteration
        last_block_size = float('inf')
    
    return Nmax

# The rest of the code remains the same
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    blocks = [(int(line.split()[0]), line.strip().split()[1]) for line in f]

result = solve_cerinta_1(blocks) if C == 1 else solve_cerinta_2(blocks)

with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
    if C == 1:
        f.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
    else:
        f.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This corrected implementation uses a while loop to build the tower by alternating between the two colors and ensures that the selected block is always smaller than the previously placed block. It also correctly increments `Nmax` whenever a block is successfully added to the tower. This should provide the correct result for the second requirement.

The error message indicates that the function `solve_cerinta_1` is not defined when the program attempts to call it. It is clear that the error is due to a missing definition for `solve_cerinta_1` in the code block provided above. However, since we only need to fix the `solve_cerinta_2` function and the rest of the program is to remain unchanged, I will re-include the definition for `solve_cerinta_1`.

Here is the complete solution with the corrected `solve_cerinta_2` function and the re-included `solve_cerinta_1` function:

```python
def solve_cerinta_1(blocks):
    T, H, current_height = 1, 0, 0
    last_block_size, last_block_color = blocks[0]
    current_height += last_block_size

    for i in range(1, len(blocks)):
        block_size, block_color = blocks[i]
        if block_size < last_block_size and block_color != last_block_color:
            current_height += block_size
            last_block_size, last_block_color = block_size, block_color
        else:
            T += 1
            H = max(H, current_height)
            last_block_size, last_block_color = block_size, block_color
            current_height = block_size
            
    H = max(H, current_height)  # Check last tower height

    return T, H

def solve_cerinta_2(blocks):
    # Split blocks into two lists based on color and sort them in descending order.
    blocks_g = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'g'), reverse=True)
    blocks_a = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'a'), reverse=True)

    # Initialize variables for the maximum tower height.
    Nmax = 0
    last_color = 'a'  # The color of the last added block to the tower (start with 'a' so we add 'g' first)

    # Loop to build the tower until no blocks are left.
    while blocks_g or blocks_a:
        if last_color == 'a':  # If last block was 'a', pick from 'g'
            g_index = next((i for i, size in enumerate(blocks_g) if size < last_size), None)
            if g_index is not None:
                last_size = blocks_g.pop(g_index)
                last_color = 'g'
                Nmax += 1
        else:  # If last block was 'g', pick from 'a'
            a_index = next((i for i, size in enumerate(blocks_a) if size < last_size), None)
            if a_index is not None:
                last_size = blocks_a.pop(a_index)
                last_color = 'a'
                Nmax += 1

        # If no block can be placed, end the loop.
        if last_size == float('inf'):
            break

        # Reset last_size for the next iteration.
        last_size = float('inf')

    return Nmax

# Read data from file.
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    blocks = [(int(line.split()[0]), line.split()[1]) for line in f]

# Depending on the task (C), solve the corresponding problem and write the output to the file.
if C == 1:

else:
    Nmax = solve_cerinta_2(blocks)

```

This code fixes the `NameError` issue by re-including the definition for `solve_cerinta_1` and provides the corrected logic for `solve_cerinta_2`. It reads the input from `turnuri.in`, solves the corresponding problem, and writes the result to `turnuri.out`.

The error is a `NameError` because the variable `last_size` is used before it has been defined. In the previous fix, I attempted to use `last_size` to track the size of the last block placed in the tower, but it was never initialized prior to its usage. We need to correct this by initializing `last_size` before the loop starts.

Let's fix the initialization of `last_size` and adjust the `solve_cerinta_2` function accordingly:

```python
def solve_cerinta_2(blocks):
    # Split blocks into two lists based on color and sort them in descending order.
    blocks_g = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'g'), reverse=True)
    blocks_a = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'a'), reverse=True)

    # Initialize variables for the maximum number of blocks in a tower.
    Nmax = 0
    last_size = float('inf')  # The size of the last added block to the tower
    last_color = 'a'  # The color of the last added block to the tower (start with 'a' so we add 'g' first)

    # Loop to build the tower until no blocks are left.
    while blocks_g or blocks_a:
        if last_color == 'a':  # If last block was 'a', pick from 'g'
            g_index = next((i for i, size in enumerate(blocks_g) if size < last_size), None)
            if g_index is not None:
                last_size = blocks_g.pop(g_index)
                last_color = 'g'
                Nmax += 1
        else:  # If last block was 'g', pick from 'a'
            a_index = next((i for i, size in enumerate(blocks_a) if size < last_size), None)
            if a_index is not None:
                last_size = blocks_a.pop(a_index)
                last_color = 'a'
                Nmax += 1

        # If no block can be placed, end the loop.
        if last_size == float('inf'):
            break

    return Nmax

# The rest of the program remains the same
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    blocks = [(int(line.split()[0]), line.split()[1]) for line in f]

# Solve problem based on the task requirement C and write the result to the file.
if C == 1:
    T, H = solve_cerinta_1(blocks)
    with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{T} {H}\n")
else:
    Nmax = solve_cerinta_2(blocks)
    with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{Nmax}\n")
```

This corrected code initializes `last_size` before entering the loop, which fixes the `NameError`. The rest of the code processes the input and output as specified. This should now correctly solve both tasks based on the input `C` and write the correct result to `turnuri.out`.

The error message indicates that the function `solve_cerinta_1` is still not defined in the provided code. To fix this issue, we need to include the implementation of `solve_cerinta_1` and also ensure that `solve_cerinta_2` is properly implemented. Here is the complete and corrected solution, including both `solve_cerinta_1` and `solve_cerinta_2`:

```python
def solve_cerinta_1(blocks):
    T, H, current_height = 1, 0, 0
    last_block_size, last_block_color = blocks[0]
    current_height += last_block_size

    for i in range(1, len(blocks)):
        block_size, block_color = blocks[i]
        if block_size < last_block_size and block_color != last_block_color:
            current_height += block_size
            last_block_size, last_block_color = block_size, block_color
        else:
            T += 1
            H = max(H, current_height)
            last_block_size, last_block_color = block_size, block_color
            current_height = block_size
            
    H = max(H, current_height)  # Check last tower height

    return T, H

def solve_cerinta_2(blocks):
    # Split blocks into two lists based on color and sort them in ascending order.
    blocks_g = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'g'))
    blocks_a = sorted((size for size, color in blocks if color == 'a'))

    # Start with the smaller blocks so that larger ones can be placed on top.
    g_index, a_index = 0, 0
    Nmax = 0
    last_color = 'a'  # Alternate starting color for the first block to be 'g'

    # Loop to build the tower alternating between the two colors.
    while g_index < len(blocks_g) and a_index < len(blocks_a):
        if last_color == 'a':
            last_color = 'g'
            Nmax += 1
            g_index += 1
        else:
            last_color = 'a'
            Nmax += 1
            a_index += 1

    return Nmax

# Read data from file.
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    blocks = [(int(line.split()[0]), line.split()[1]) for line in f]

# Solve the problem based on the input C and write the result to the file.
if C == 1:
    T, H = solve_cerinta_1(blocks)
    with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{T} {H}\n")
else:
    Nmax = solve_cerinta_2(blocks)
    with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{Nmax}\n")
```

In `solve_cerinta_2`, I have changed the sorting to be in ascending order so that we can build the tower from smaller to larger blocks while alternating colors. This solution iterates through both color lists, always selecting the next smallest block of the opposite color until no more blocks can be placed.

The rest of the program reads from `turnuri.in`, calls the appropriate function based on the input `C`, and writes the output to `turnuri.out`. This should now correctly solve both tasks and address the previous `NameError`.
