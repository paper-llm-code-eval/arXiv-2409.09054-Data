Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

# Read the input from 'deal.in'

# Iterate over the tower heights to calculate the sum of peak heights
for height in tower_heights:
    # If the current tower is taller than the current peak, it becomes the new peak
    if height > current_peak:
        current_peak = height

# Write the output to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_sum_of_peaks))
```

This solution reads the number of towers and their heights from `deal.in`, iterates through the list of tower heights while keeping track of the current peak height and adds it to the total sum of peak heights. The result is then written to `deal.out`. The code is designed to be efficient by only iterating through the list once and using simple arithmetic operations.

The initial solution incorrectly assumes that each tower contributes its height to the total sum as long as it is equal to or higher than the previous tower. However, the problem defines a "deal" (hill) as a sequence of towers where each subsequent tower is taller than the previous one. When a shorter tower is encountered, a new "deal" starts, and the sum of heights should only include the tallest tower from each "deal".

To correct this, the algorithm needs to track the start of a new "deal" whenever a tower shorter than the previous one is encountered. At that point, the height of the tallest tower in the previous "deal" should be added to the total sum, and a new "deal" should start with the current tower as the first tower.

Let's fix the algorithm accordingly:

```python
# Read the input from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize variables to store the current peak height, the total sum of peak heights,
# and the height of the tallest tower in the current deal
current_peak = 0
total_sum_of_peaks = 0
tallest_in_current_deal = 0

# Iterate over the tower heights to calculate the sum of peak heights
for height in tower_heights:
    if height > tallest_in_current_deal:
        # Tower is part of the current deal
        tallest_in_current_deal = height
    else:
        # A new deal starts; add the tallest tower of the previous deal to the sum
        total_sum_of_peaks += tallest_in_current_deal
        # Reset the tallest tower for the new deal
        tallest_in_current_deal = height

# Add the tallest tower of the last deal to the sum
total_sum_of_peaks += tallest_in_current_deal

# Write the output to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_sum_of_peaks))
```

This corrected solution should properly identify the tallest tower in each "deal" and add only those to the total sum. It will start a new "deal" every time a tower shorter than the previous peak is encountered. The height of the tallest tower from the last "deal" is also added to the sum after the loop.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to an oversight in the logic that handles the transition between deals. The corrected algorithm does properly identify when a new deal begins, but it also adds the height of the last tower of a deal to the total sum, which results in counting the height of some towers multiple times. This is why the found output is higher than the expected output.

According to the problem statement, only the tallest tower of each deal contributes to the total sum, and each tower can be part of at most one deal. The correct approach is to start a new deal whenever a tower shorter than the last one is encountered, adding the height of the tallest tower of the previous deal to the sum at that point.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct algorithm:

```python
# Read the input from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize variables to store the current peak height and the total sum of peak heights
current_peak = tower_heights[0]  # The first tower is the starting peak of the first deal
total_sum_of_peaks = 0

# Iterate over the tower heights starting from the second tower to calculate the sum of peak heights
for i in range(1, N):
    if tower_heights[i] > current_peak:
        # Current tower is taller than the peak, so it's part of the current deal
        current_peak = tower_heights[i]
    else:
        # The current tower is shorter than the peak, which means the end of the current deal
        # Add the current peak to the total and start a new deal with the current tower as the peak
        total_sum_of_peaks += current_peak
        current_peak = tower_heights[i]

# Add the peak of the last deal to the total sum
total_sum_of_peaks += current_peak

# Write the output to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_sum_of_peaks))
```

In this solution, the loop starts from the second tower because the first tower is considered as the starting peak of the first deal. The algorithm then checks each subsequent tower to decide whether it's part of the current deal or it signifies the start of a new deal. When a new deal starts, it adds the height of the last deal's peak to the total sum and sets the current tower as the new peak. After the loop, it ensures that the peak of the last deal is also added to the total sum. This should yield the correct output.

The found output is incorrect because the solution doesn't properly handle the case where consecutive towers of the same height are part of the same deal. When encountering a tower of equal height to the current peak, it should not start a new deal, but rather continue the current deal.

To fix the algorithm, we need to adjust the logic to continue the current deal if the height of the tower is equal to or greater than the current peak. A new deal should only start when the height of the tower is strictly less than the current peak. When a new deal starts, the previous peak is added to the total sum, and the current tower sets the starting height for the next deal.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the current deal's peak height to the first tower
current_peak = tower_heights[0]
# Initialize the total sum of peak heights
total_sum_of_peaks = 0

# Iterate over the tower heights to calculate the sum of peak heights
for i in range(1, N):
    if tower_heights[i] < current_peak:
        # A new deal starts because the current tower is shorter than the current peak
        # Add the current peak to the total sum before starting the new deal
        total_sum_of_peaks += current_peak
        # Set the current tower as the first tower (peak) of the new deal
        current_peak = tower_heights[i]
    else:
        # Otherwise, the current tower is part of the existing deal, and we potentially update the peak
        current_peak = max(current_peak, tower_heights[i])

# After the loop, add the peak of the last deal to the total sum
total_sum_of_peaks += current_peak

# Write the output to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_sum_of_peaks))
```

This solution ensures that consecutive towers of equal height are considered part of the same deal. Additionally, it only starts a new deal and adds the peak height to the total when it encounters a tower that is strictly shorter than the previous peak. This should produce the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected result and the found result arises because the previous solution does not correctly form deals according to the rules. A new deal should start not only when the height of the tower is strictly less than the previous peak, but also when the current tower height is equal to the previous tower height, because a deal is defined as a sequence of strictly increasing heights.

A correct solution should maintain a running sum of peak heights where each tower is only considered once, and a peak height is included in the total sum when the next tower height is less than the current tower height, thus signifying the start of a new deal.

Let's fix the implementation with the correct logic:

```python
# Read the input from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the total sum of peak heights and the height of the last tower
total_sum_of_peaks = 0
last_tower_height = 0

# Iterate over the tower heights to calculate the sum of peak heights
for i in range(N):
    if tower_heights[i] > last_tower_height:
        # The current tower is taller than the last, so it might be the peak of a new deal
        total_sum_of_peaks += tower_heights[i] - last_tower_height
    # Update the last tower height for the next iteration
    last_tower_height = tower_heights[i]

# Write the output to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_sum_of_peaks))
```

In this solution, the variable `last_tower_height` is updated with the height of the current tower after each iteration. When the next tower is taller than the last, the increase in height is added to `total_sum_of_peaks`, which ensures that each tower's height is considered only once, and only the tallest tower of each deal contributes to the sum. This should produce the expected output.

The issue with the previous implementation is that it incorrectly adds the difference between the current and last tower's height whenever the current tower is taller. Instead, we need to add the height of the tallest tower to the total sum whenever we encounter a shorter tower that signals the end of the current deal.

We also need to keep track of the tallest tower seen in the current deal. When we encounter a shorter tower, we add the tallest tower of the current deal to the total sum, and then reset the tallest tower to the height of the current tower, as it signals the start of a new deal.

Let's implement this corrected logic:

```python
# Read the input from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the total sum of peak heights
total_sum_of_peaks = 0
# Start with the first tower being the tallest in the current deal
tallest_in_current_deal = tower_heights[0]

# Iterate over the tower heights starting from the second one
for height in tower_heights[1:]:
    if height < tallest_in_current_deal:
        # Add the tallest tower of the current deal to the total sum
        total_sum_of_peaks += tallest_in_current_deal
        # The current tower is shorter, so it starts a new deal
        tallest_in_current_deal = height
    else:
        # Update the tallest in the current deal if the current tower is taller
        tallest_in_current_deal = max(tallest_in_current_deal, height)

# Add the tallest tower of the last deal to the total sum
total_sum_of_peaks += tallest_in_current_deal

# Write the output to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_sum_of_peaks))
```

With this implementation, we correctly track the tallest tower within each deal and sum up these heights whenever a shorter tower indicates a transition to a new deal. The height of the tallest tower in the last deal is added to the sum after the loop. This should now give us the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results arises because the previous solution does not account for consecutive towers of equal height correctly. According to the problem statement, towers of equal height ($h_i = h_{i+1}$) are part of the same deal. The previous solution incorrectly adds the tallest tower height of the current deal to the total sum for each tower that is shorter than the tallest in the current deal, but it does not correctly handle consecutive towers of the same height.

To fix the solution, we need to add the tallest tower height of the current deal to the total sum only when a strictly smaller tower is encountered, which signals the end of the current deal. If towers have the same height, they are still part of the same deal.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the total sum of peak heights and the height of the tallest tower in the current deal
total_sum_of_peaks = 0
tallest_in_current_deal = 0

# Iterate over the tower heights to calculate the sum of peak heights
for height in tower_heights:
    if height > tallest_in_current_deal:
        # The current tower is taller than the tallest tower in the current deal, so update it
        tallest_in_current_deal = height
    elif height < tallest_in_current_deal:
        # The current tower is shorter than the tallest tower in the current deal,
        # so add the tallest tower of the current deal to the total sum
        total_sum_of_peaks += tallest_in_current_deal
        # Start a new deal with the current tower as the tallest
        tallest_in_current_deal = height

# Add the tallest tower of the last deal to the total sum
total_sum_of_peaks += tallest_in_current_deal

# Write the output to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_sum_of_peaks))
```

This solution ensures that we only add the height of the tallest tower when a strictly lower tower indicates the end of a deal. Towers of equal height are considered part of the same deal and do not trigger a new deal start. The height of the tallest tower in the last deal is also added to the sum after the loop. This should now produce the expected output.
