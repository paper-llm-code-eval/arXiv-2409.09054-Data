Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

Upon reevaluation of the issue, I realize the mistake in the algorithm. The previous solution did not properly handle the case where multiple towers of the same height are encountered. According to the rules, if a tower is not taller than the previous one, it should be considered part of the same hill. Therefore, the sum should only increase when a taller tower is encountered.

Let me correct the algorithm and rewrite the solution. In this new implementation, I will ensure that the sum increases only when we encounter a tower that is taller than the previous one, thus treating consecutive towers of equal height as part of the same hill.

```python
# Function to calculate the maximum possible sum of heights of hills formed by the towers
def max_sum_of_heights(heights):
    max_height = 0  # maximum height of the current hill
    total_height = 0  # the total sum of hill heights

    for height in heights:
        # If the current height is greater than the maximum height of the current hill,
        # we have a new hill and update the total sum.
        if height > max_height:
            max_height = height
        total_height += max_height

    return total_height

# Calculate the maximum possible sum of heights
max_sum = max_sum_of_heights(tower_heights)

# Write to 'deal.out'

The results differ because the current algorithm does not account for the fact that after a hill (peak) is formed, any subsequent towers that are shorter than the peak can form a new hill. Essentially, when a lower height is encountered after a peak, the algorithm should reset the current hill's maximum height to this new lower height and start considering a new hill from there. The previous implementation incorrectly continued to add the height of the tallest peak encountered so far.

To fix this, we need to track when a peak has been reached and reset the maximum height each time a lower tower height is encountered after a peak.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the maximum possible sum of heights of hills formed by the towers
def max_sum_of_heights(heights):
    max_height = 0  # maximum height of the current hill
    total_height = 0  # the total sum of hill heights

    for height in heights:
        # If we encounter a tower that is shorter than the maximum height of the current hill,
        # it means the previous hill has ended, and we need to start a new hill.
        if height < max_height:
            max_height = height
        # Update the total height for the current hill
        total_height += max_height
        # Update the maximum height if the current tower is taller than the previous maximum
        if height > max_height:
            max_height = height

    return total_height

# Read from 'deal.in'

    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # read the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # read the tower heights

# Calculate the maximum possible sum of heights
max_sum = max_sum_of_heights(tower_heights)

# Write to 'deal.out'

    file.write(str(max_sum))

My apologies for the confusion in the previous attempts. It looks like there was a misunderstanding in the logic of the problem. When arranging the towers to form hills, we can start a new hill with any tower that is not higher than the previous one. This means that we should accumulate the heights of towers when they are equal to or higher than the previous tower, and start a new hill whenever we encounter a tower that is lower than the previous one.

Let's re-implement the solution with this correct understanding of the problem:

```python
# Function to calculate the maximum possible sum of heights of hills formed by the towers
def max_sum_of_heights(heights):
    sum_of_heights = heights[0]  # start with the first height
    current_max = heights[0]  # the height of the first tower

    for height in heights[1:]:
        if height >= current_max:
            sum_of_heights += height
            current_max = height
        else:
            sum_of_heights += current_max

    return sum_of_heights

# Read from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # read the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # read the tower heights

# Calculate the maximum possible sum of heights
max_sum = max_sum_of_heights(tower_heights)

# Write to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_sum))
```
This code should now correctly calculate the sum of the heights of the hills that can be formed by the given arrangement of towers, considering the rules specified in the problem.

I apologize for the oversight. To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider that once a tower is used to form a hill, the height of the next hill can only be equal to or lower than the height of the last tower in the previous hill. The sum of the hill heights is maximized by using the tallest possible tower for each hill while following this rule.

I will re-implement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
def max_sum_of_heights(heights):
    # Initialize the sum of hills' heights with the first tower's height
    sum_of_heights = heights[0]
    # The height of the last tower used will be the starting point for the next hill
    last_tower_height = heights[0]
    
    for height in heights[1:]:
        if height > last_tower_height:
            # Add the difference if the height of the current tower
            # is greater than the height of the last tower in the previous hill
            sum_of_heights += (height - last_tower_height)
        # The current tower becomes the last tower for the next round
        last_tower_height = height

    return sum_of_heights

# Read from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # read the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # read the tower heights

# Calculate the maximum possible sum of heights
max_sum = max_sum_of_heights(tower_heights)

# Write to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This updated solution should now properly account for the formation of hills with the tallest possible tower for each hill, ensuring that the sum of the heights of the hills is maximized according to the rules of the problem.

Upon further review, it seems I misunderstood the rules of the problem in our previous attempts. The goal is to arrange the towers in a sequence such that they form hills with maximum total height. A hill starts with a tower of a certain height and includes all subsequent towers of equal or greater height until a tower of a lesser height is encountered, which then starts a new hill.

Therefore, we need to iterate over the list of tower heights and keep adding the height of the tallest tower encountered so far to the sum until we reach a shorter tower, which signals the start of a new hill.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
# Read from 'deal.in'
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # read the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # read the tower heights

# Initialize the sum of hill heights with the first tower and set it as the current hill height
sum_of_hill_heights = current_hill_height = tower_heights[0]

# Iterate through the rest of the towers to form hills
for height in tower_heights[1:]:
    # If the current tower is as tall or taller than the current hill, extend the current hill
    if height >= current_hill_height:
        sum_of_hill_heights += height
        current_hill_height = height
    # Otherwise, start a new hill with the current tower
    else:
        sum_of_hill_heights += current_hill_height

# Write to 'deal.out'
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(sum_of_hill_heights))
```

This corrected solution should now properly calculate the sum of the heights of the hills that can be formed by the given arrangement of towers, adhering to the rules specified in the problem.
