În vederea asigurării unei transmiteri cât mai exacte a informaţiilor pe reţea, transmiterea se efectuează caracter cu caracter, fiecare caracter fiind dat prin codul său ASCII, adică o grupă de 8 biţi (octet). Pentru fiecare 8 biţi transmişi se calculează un bit de paritate care are valoarea $0$ (dacă codul ASCII al caracterului conţine un număr par de cifre binare $1$) sau $1$ (în caz contrar). Deoarece în problema noastră se transmit numai caractere ASCII standard, cu codul ASCII din intervalul $[32, 127]$, codul lor ASCII are bitul $7$ (primul bit din stânga) egal cu $0$. Pe această poziţie va fi pus bitul de paritate, economisind astfel câte un bit pentru fiecare caracter transmis. De exemplu, dacă mesajul care trebuie trasmis conţine caracterele `Paritate`, succesiunea de biţi transmisă va fi:
$\textcolor{red}{0}1010000\ \textcolor{red}{1}1100001\ \textcolor{red}{0}1110010\ \textcolor{red}{0}1101001\ \textcolor{red}{0}1110100\ \textcolor{red}{1}1100001\ \textcolor{red}{0}1110100\ \textcolor{red}{0}1100101$

În plus, pe lângă caracterele amintite, în mesaj mai poate să apară un caracter special, caracter care indică trecerea la începutul unui nou rând. Acest caracter are codul ASCII $10$.

# Cerinţă
Să se scrie un program care să verifice dacă un text a fost sau nu transmis corect.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `paritate.in` are pe prima linie o succesiune de caractere `0` şi `1` care reprezintă mesajul transmis. Între caractere nu există spaţii. Linia se termină cu caracterul newline (`\n`).

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `paritate.out` are pe prima linie mesajul `DA` dacă textul a fost transmis corect sau `NU` în caz contrar. În cazul în care mesajul de pe prima linie este `DA`, liniile următoare vor conţine textul transmis în clar. În cazul în care mesajul de pe prima linie este `NU`, linia următoare va conţine numerele de ordine ale caracterelor care nu au fost transmise corect, în ordine strict crescătoare, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Cei 8 biţi ai codului ASCII a unui caracter se numerotează de la $0$ la $7$, de la dreapta la stânga, cel mai din stânga bit fiind bitul $7$ iar cel mai din dreapta bitul $0$.
- Textul transmis are cel mult $60\ 000$ de caractere.
- Numărul de caractere `0` şi `1` din prima linie a fişierului de intrare este multiplu de $8$.
- Codurile ASCII ale caracterelor din text aparţin mulţimii $\{10, 32, 33, 34, \dots, 127\}$, codul $10$ însemnând trecerea la începutul unui rând nou (newline).
- Nicio linie din fişierul de ieşire nu va avea mai mult de $255$ caractere.
- Caracterele din text sunt numerotate începând de la $0$.
- Mesajele `DA`/`NU` din prima linie a fişierului de ieşire se scriu cu majuscule.

Based on the feedback, it appears that my initial code incorrectly computed the parity bit for each character, leading to an incorrect output where it reported errors for almost all characters. Upon review, I believe I found the mistake: the parity bit should be included in the count of '1's to determine whether the character was transmitted correctly. The parity bit is supposed to make the total count of '1's even. So, if the character including the parity bit has an odd number of '1's, then there is a transmission error.

Let's fix the code to properly check the parity by including the parity bit in the count of '1's for each 9-bit sequence:

```python
def check_and_decode_sequence(seq):
    correct = True
    errors = []
    decoded_message = ''
    for i in range(0, len(seq), 9):
        byte_with_parity = seq[i:i + 9]
        if byte_with_parity.count('1') % 2 != 0:  # Check if total count of '1's is odd
            correct = False
            errors.append(i // 9 + 1)  # Character positions are one-indexed for output
        else:
            byte = byte_with_parity[1:]  # Exclude the parity bit
            decoded_message += chr(int(byte, 2))  # Decode ASCII to character
    return correct, errors, decoded_message

# Read the input sequence from 'paritate.in'
with open('paritate.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.read().strip()

# Check and decode the sequence
correct, errors, message = check_and_decode_sequence(sequence)

# Write the results to 'paritate.out'
with open('paritate.out', 'w') as file:
    if correct:
        file.write('DA\n' + message + '\n')
    else:
        file.write('NU\n' + ' '.join(map(str, errors)) + '\n')
```

This updated code snippet should now correctly check the parity of each transmitted character and decode the message if the transmission is correct. It also provides the correct position of the characters that were not transmitted correctly, following the requirement to start character numbering from 1 in the output file.

Upon reviewing the output, it seems that the updated solution still incorrectly identifies characters as being transmitted incorrectly. The problem likely lies in the way the parity is being checked or how the data is being parsed.

The error in the previous solution was that it incorrectly identified characters with correct parity as having errors. This is because the parity bit itself should not be included in the count when checking for even parity; it's supposed to be a result of the count. If the count of '1's in the eight data bits is even, the parity bit should be '0', and if the count is odd, the parity bit should be '1'.

I will correct the code by excluding the parity bit from the count when determining if the transmitted character has even parity:

```python
def check_and_decode_sequence(seq):
    correct = True
    errors = []
    decoded_message = ''
    for i in range(0, len(seq), 9):
        parity_bit = seq[i]
        data_bits = seq[i + 1:i + 9]
        if data_bits.count('1') % 2 != int(parity_bit):
            correct = False
            errors.append(i // 9 + 1)  # Use one-based indexing for error positions
        else:
            decoded_message += chr(int(data_bits, 2))  # Convert binary to ASCII character
    return correct, errors, decoded_message

# Read the input sequence from 'paritate.in'
with open('paritate.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.read().strip()

# Check and decode the sequence
correct, errors, message = check_and_decode_sequence(sequence)

# Write the results to 'paritate.out'
with open('paritate.out', 'w') as file:
    if correct:
        file.write('DA\n' + message + '\n')
    else:
        file.write('NU\n' + ' '.join(map(str, errors)) + '\n')
```

This corrected code now properly checks the parity by excluding the parity bit from the count of '1's in the data bits. If the count is even and the parity bit is '0', or if the count is odd and the parity bit is '1', then the character has been transmitted correctly. If the transmission is correct, the code decodes the message; otherwise, it reports the positions of the incorrectly transmitted characters.

The results still do not match the expected output, indicating that there's a mistake in the parity checking logic. After careful consideration, I realize that the parity bit should be '1' if the number of '1' bits in the data bits is odd, making the total count (including the parity bit) even. However, the code I provided earlier incorrectly assumes that the parity bit should match the parity of the data bits, which is not the case.

Let's correct the code by checking if the parity bit is '1' when the count of '1's in the data bits is odd, and '0' when the count is even. Additionally, it's important to note that there was an off-by-one error in the reporting of the character positions. When reporting which characters have errors, the positions should start from 1, not from 0.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def check_and_decode_sequence(seq):
    correct = True
    errors = []
    decoded_message = ''
    for i in range(0, len(seq), 9):
        parity_bit = int(seq[i])
        data_bits = seq[i + 1:i + 9]
        ones_count = data_bits.count('1')
        # Check if the parity bit is correct (parity bit should be '1' if ones_count is odd to make it even, 
        # otherwise '0')
        if ones_count % 2 == parity_bit:
            correct = False
            errors.append(i // 9 + 1)  # Character positions are 1-indexed
        else:
            decoded_message += chr(int(data_bits, 2))  # Convert binary to ASCII character
    return correct, errors, decoded_message

# Read the input sequence from 'paritate.in'
with open('paritate.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.read().strip()

# Check and decode the sequence
correct, errors, message = check_and_decode_sequence(sequence)

# Write the results to 'paritate.out'
with open('paritate.out', 'w') as file:
    if correct:
        file.write('DA\n' + message)  # No need to add an extra newline at the end
    else:
        file.write('NU\n' + ' '.join(map(str, errors)))
```

This code should now correctly decode the message and identify transmission errors, outputting the correct result in 'paritate.out'. It should write 'DA' followed by the decoded message if the transmission is correct, or 'NU' followed by the erroneous character positions if there are any transmission errors.

The error "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 2: ''" indicates that the code is trying to convert an empty string to an integer with base 2. This suggests that the input sequence may not be properly formatted into 9-bit segments, leading to an attempt to convert an empty string to an integer.

Here's a revised version of the solution that includes a check to ensure that we never attempt to convert an empty string to an integer. Additionally, the revised code will handle any potential cases where the input data does not correctly split into 9-bit segments:

```python
def check_and_decode_sequence(seq):
    correct = True
    errors = []
    decoded_message = ''
    for i in range(0, len(seq), 9):
        byte_with_parity = seq[i:i+9]
        # Ensure the segment is 9 bits
        if len(byte_with_parity) != 9:
            correct = False
            errors.append(i // 9 + 1)
            continue
        
        parity_bit = byte_with_parity[0]
        data_bits = byte_with_parity[1:]
        ones_count = data_bits.count('1')
        
        # Parity bit is '1' if number of '1' in data_bits is odd, making the total even
        if ones_count % 2 != int(parity_bit):
            correct = False
            errors.append(i // 9 + 1)
        else:
            decoded_message += chr(int(data_bits, 2))
    return correct, errors, decoded_message

# Read the input sequence from 'paritate.in'
with open('paritate.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.read().strip()

# Check and decode the sequence
correct, errors, message = check_and_decode_sequence(sequence)

# Write the results to 'paritate.out'
with open('paritate.out', 'w') as file:
    if correct:
        file.write('DA\n' + message)
    else:
        file.write('NU\n' + ' '.join(map(str, errors)))
```

This solution reads the input file, checks each 9-bit segment for proper parity, decodes the ASCII characters if the parity is correct, and writes the appropriate output to the 'paritate.out' file. The code also ensures that every 9-bit segment is of the correct length before attempting any conversion. If the input sequence is not as expected, it immediately marks the character as corrupted (indicated by adding its position to the errors list) and continues with the next character.

The error persists because the check for the parity bit was incorrect in the previous solutions. The correct check should determine whether the number of '1's in the data bits is even or odd and then verify that the parity bit is '0' if the number of '1's is even, and '1' if it is odd. This ensures that the total number of '1's (data bits plus the parity bit) is always even.

The error in the previous solutions was that the check was inverted, which caused the program to incorrectly flag correctly transmitted characters as errors. Let's fix this by adjusting the parity check logic:

```python
def check_and_decode_sequence(seq):
    correct = True
    errors = []
    decoded_message = ''
    for i in range(0, len(seq), 9):
        # Extract the parity bit and the 8 data bits
        parity_bit = int(seq[i])
        data_bits = seq[i + 1:i + 9]

        # Calculate the number of '1's in data bits
        ones_count = data_bits.count('1')

        # If ones_count is odd, parity_bit should be '1' to make the total even, and vice versa
        if ones_count % 2 == 0 and parity_bit != 0 or ones_count % 2 == 1 and parity_bit != 1:
            correct = False
            errors.append(i // 9 + 1)
            continue

        # Convert binary to ASCII character
        decoded_message += chr(int(data_bits, 2))

    return correct, errors, decoded_message

# Read the input sequence from 'paritate.in'
with open('paritate.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.read().strip()

# Check and decode the sequence
correct, errors, message = check_and_decode_sequence(sequence)

# Write the results to 'paritate.out'
with open('paritate.out', 'w') as file:
    if correct:
        file.write('DA\n' + message)
    else:
        file.write('NU\n' + ' '.join(map(str, errors)))
```

This solution properly checks the parity of each transmitted character and decodes the message if the transmission is correct. If there are any transmission errors, it reports the positions of the incorrectly transmitted characters in the output file 'paritate.out'. The character positions are 1-indexed, as per the problem statement. The solution should now match the expected output.

I apologize for the confusion. Upon reviewing the challenge, a parity bit of '1' means that the data bits (excluding the parity bit itself) contain an odd number of '1's, and a parity bit of '0' means that the data bits contain an even number of '1's. The code I provided earlier was mistakenly counting the parity bit itself as part of the data bits, which led to incorrect results.

Let's rewrite the solution to correctly process the input data, checking the number of '1's in the data bits only (excluding the parity bit) and ensuring that the parity bit reflects the appropriate parity:

```python
# Check each 8-bit sequence for correct parity and decode ASCII characters.
def check_parity_and_decode(data):
    correct = True
    errors = []
    message = ''
    for i in range(0, len(data), 9):  # Process in chunks of 9 bits (1 parity + 8 data bits)
        chunk = data[i:i+9]
        parity_bit = int(chunk[0])
        byte = chunk[1:]
        num_ones = byte.count('1')
        if num_ones % 2 == parity_bit:  # Verify parity; 0 if even, 1 if odd
            correct = False
            errors.append(i // 9 + 1)  # Error positions are 1-indexed
        else:
            message += chr(int(byte, 2))  # Convert binary to ASCII
    return correct, message, errors

# Read the input binary sequence from 'paritate.in'
with open('paritate.in', 'r') as f:
    binary_data = f.readline().strip()

# Check the parity of each character and decode the message
correct, decoded_message, error_positions = check_parity_and_decode(binary_data)

# Write the results to 'paritate.out'
with open('paritate.out', 'w') as f:
    if correct:
        f.write('DA\n' + decoded_message + '\n')
    else:
        f.write('NU\n' + ' '.join(map(str, error_positions)) + '\n')
```

This rewritten solution defines a function `check_parity_and_decode()` that processes the binary input data in chunks of 9 bits. It checks the parity of the 8 data bits according to the provided parity bit and decodes the message. If an error is found, the one-indexed position of the character is recorded. Then, the input is read from the file 'paritate.in', the function is called with the input data, and the result is written to 'paritate.out' according to the problem's specifications. The solution should now produce the correct results.
