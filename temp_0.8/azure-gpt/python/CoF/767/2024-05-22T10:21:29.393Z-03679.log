Se consideră $N$ puncte colorate dispuse în plan. Ele sunt identificate prin coordontele lor întregi, pe axele OX și OY. Fiecare punct are asociat un număr natural între $1$ și $C$ reprezentând codul culorii lui. Un dreptunghi se numește *corect* dacă îndeplinește simultan următoarele condiții:

* toate cele patru vârfuri se regăsesc printre cele N puncte date;
* are laturile paralele cu axele OX, OY;
* are vârfurile colorate în aceeași culoare.

# Cerință

Să se determine numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri *corecte* care se pot forma cu cele $N$ puncte din plan.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.in` se găsesc două numere $N, MaxC$ reprezentând numărul de puncte din plan și numărul de culori asociate punctelor. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se citesc câte trei numere $x \ y \ c$ reprezentând în ordine coordonata pe axa OX (abscisa), coordonata pe axa OY (ordonata) și codul culorii asociate punctului.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.out` se va scrie un singur număr cu semnificația numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri corecte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq C \leq 5$;
* $-1 \ 000 \leq x, y \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Nu există două puncte cu aceleași coordonate
* $40$% din teste vor avea $N \leq 100$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Open input and output files
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as file_in, open('dreptc.out', 'w') as file_out:
    # Read the number of points N and number of colors C from the input file
    N, C = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
    
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the points by color
    points_by_color = {color: [] for color in range(1, C + 1)}
    
    # Read the points and group them by color
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y, color = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
        points_by_color[color].append((x, y))
    
    # Function to count the number of rectangles formed by points of the same color
    def count_rectangles(points):
        rectangles = 0
        points.sort()  # Sort the points by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate
        # Create a set of y-coordinates for each x-coordinate
        y_coordinates = {}
        for x, y in points:
            if x not in y_coordinates:
                y_coordinates[x] = set()
            y_coordinates[x].add(y)
        
        # Iterate through pairs of x-coordinates
        for i in range(len(points)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
                x1, y1 = points[i]
                x2, y2 = points[j]
                # Check if we have a potential rectangle
                if x1 != x2 and y1 != y2:
                    # Check if the other two corners exist
                    if y2 in y_coordinates[x1] and y1 in y_coordinates[x2]:
                        rectangles += 1
        return rectangles
    
    # Initialize the counter for maximum rectangles
    max_rectangles = 0
    
    # Calculate the number of rectangles for each color
    for color in range(1, C + 1):
        max_rectangles += count_rectangles(points_by_color[color])

    # Write the result to the output file
    file_out.write(str(max_rectangles))
```

This solution reads from `dreptc.in` and writes the result to `dreptc.out`. It calculates the maximum number of correct rectangles that can be formed with the given points in the plane, grouped by color.

Note that the function `count_rectangles` sorts the points to ensure that they are processed in order, and then it iterates through all possible pairs of points (forming opposite corners of a rectangle) to count the number of rectangles. The existence of the other two corners is checked using the `y_coordinates` dictionary. This approach avoids the need to check every possible combination of four points, thus optimizing the solution for faster execution.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, it seems that the `count_rectangles` function mistakenly counts some rectangles multiple times. Specifically, it counts any rectangle with opposite corners `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` twice, once for each order of the opposite corners.

To fix the algorithm, we need to ensure that each rectangle is only counted once. We can do this by only considering pairs where `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2`, ensuring that we only count rectangles oriented in a specific direction.

Let’s rewrite the function `count_rectangles` to incorporate this fix and then update the entire solution.

```python
# Open input and output files
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as file_in, open('dreptc.out', 'w') as file_out:
    # Read the number of points N and number of colors C from the input file
    N, C = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
    
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the points by color
    points_by_color = {color: [] for color in range(1, C + 1)}
    
    # Read the points and group them by color
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y, color = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
        points_by_color[color].append((x, y))
    
    # Function to count the number of rectangles formed by points of the same color
    def count_rectangles(points):
        rectangles = 0
        points.sort()  # Sort the points by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate
        # Create a set of y-coordinates for each x-coordinate
        y_coordinates = {}
        for x, y in points:
            if x not in y_coordinates:
                y_coordinates[x] = set()
            y_coordinates[x].add(y)
        
        # Iterate through pairs of x-coordinates
        for i in range(len(points)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
                x1, y1 = points[i]
                x2, y2 = points[j]
                # Check if we have a potential rectangle with x1 < x2 and y1 < y2
                if x1 < x2 and y1 < y2:
                    # Check if the other two corners exist
                    if y2 in y_coordinates[x1] and y1 in y_coordinates[x2]:
                        rectangles += 1
        return rectangles
    
    # Initialize the counter for maximum rectangles
    max_rectangles = 0
    
    # Calculate the number of rectangles for each color
    for color in range(1, C + 1):
        max_rectangles += count_rectangles(points_by_color[color])

    # Write the result to the output file
    file_out.write(str(max_rectangles))
```

In this version of the solution, the `count_rectangles` function only counts a rectangle if the current point `(x1, y1)` has both `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2` compared to the other point `(x2, y2)`. This way, each rectangle is counted exactly once.

This should produce the correct output for the given input and meet the requirements of the programming challenge.
