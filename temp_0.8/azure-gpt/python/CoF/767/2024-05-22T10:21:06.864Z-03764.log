# Write the result to output file

This Python code solves the problem as specified in the challenge. The input is read from a file named `dreptc.in`, and the output is written to a file named `dreptc.out`. The code does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations. Instead, it uses file I/O to read from and write to the specified files. 

It's important to note that this is the optimal solution I've come up with for the given constraints, but there might be more optimizations or entirely different approaches that could lead to faster execution times.

Upon inspecting the original code provided, I realize that the logic for counting the rectangles is incorrect. The code incorrectly checks for the existence of the two opposite vertices of a rectangle (which share the same y-coordinate), but it doesn't correctly identify the other two vertices that would close the rectangle.

To correct this, the algorithm needs to be reworked. For each color, we should find all pairs of points that can form the opposite corners of a rectangle (same x or same y), and then check if the other two corners exist. Here's the updated Python code:

```python
def count_rectangles(points_by_color):
    count = 0
    for color, pts in points_by_color.items():
        sorted_by_x = sorted(pts)
        sorted_by_y = sorted(pts, key=lambda p: p[1])
        
        # Dictionary to keep track of points with the same x or y coordinate
        points_by_x = {}
        points_by_y = {}
        for x, y in pts:
            if x not in points_by_x:
                points_by_x[x] = []
            if y not in points_by_y:
                points_by_y[y] = []
            points_by_x[x].append(y)
            points_by_y[y].append(x)
        
        # Check for each pair of points if they can form a rectangle
        for i in range(len(sorted_by_x)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(sorted_by_x)):
                x1, y1 = sorted_by_x[i]
                x2, y2 = sorted_by_x[j]
                if y1 != y2:
                    continue
                if x1 in points_by_x and x2 in points_by_x:
                    for y in points_by_x[x1]:
                        if y != y1 and y in points_by_x[x2]:
                            count += 1
    return count

# Read input
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, MaxC = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    points_by_color = {i: set() for i in range(1, MaxC + 1)}
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y, c = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        points_by_color[c].add((x, y))

# Calculate the number of correct rectangles
correct_rectangles = count_rectangles(points_by_color)

# Write output
with open('dreptc.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(correct_rectangles) + '\n')
```

Now, let's explain the differences between the expected and the found results:

1. The original code did not correctly handle rectangles sharing the same y-coordinate. It only checked for the opposite corners having the same y-coordinate which can form a line segment, not a rectangle.

2. The original code was counting each rectangle multiple times because it did not account for rectangles being identified more than once by their different pairs of opposite corners.

3. The original code did not properly manage the set of points for each color, which might result in missing potential rectangles.

4. The original code did not adequately iterate through all possible rectangle corner pairs for a given y-coordinate.

The rewritten solution fixes these issues by organizing the points by their x and y coordinates separately for each color and then checking for each pair of points with the same y-coordinate if the other two corners exist to form a rectangle. It only counts each rectangle once, addressing the issue of overcounting.

The issue with the previous solution is that it overcounts rectangles by not correctly matching the horizontal pairs with vertical pairs. We need to ensure that we only count rectangles where both pairs of points have the same color and form the opposite corners of a rectangle.

To fix the problem, we will use a different approach:

1. Group all points by their color.
2. For each group of points with the same color, create a dictionary of points indexed by their x-coordinate.
3. For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate, check if there are points with the same y-coordinates to form the opposite corners of a rectangle.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as file:
    N, MaxC = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    points_by_color = {c: [] for c in range(1, MaxC+1)}
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y, c = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        points_by_color[c].append((x, y))

# Function to count rectangles for a given color
def count_rectangles_for_color(points):
    points_by_x_coord = {}
    for (x, y) in points:
        if x not in points_by_x_coord:
            points_by_x_coord[x] = []
        points_by_x_coord[x].append(y)
    
    rectangles_count = 0
    for x, y_list in points_by_x_coord.items():
        if len(y_list) < 2:
            continue
        y_list.sort()
        for i in range(len(y_list)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(y_list)):
                y1, y2 = y_list[i], y_list[j]
                if y1 in points_by_x_coord and y2 in points_by_x_coord:
                    # Check if we can form a rectangle with points on the same y coordinates
                    shared_points = set(points_by_x_coord[y1]).intersection(points_by_x_coord[y2])
                    rectangles_count += len(shared_points)
    
    return rectangles_count // 2  # Each rectangle is counted twice

# Count the correct rectangles
correct_rectangles = 0
for c in range(1, MaxC+1):
    correct_rectangles += count_rectangles_for_color(points_by_color[c])

# Write to the output file
with open('dreptc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(correct_rectangles) + '\n')
```

Explanation of the differences:

- The previous code was overcounting because it did not properly pair the points to form rectangles.
- The previous code did not account for the fact that two points with the same y-coordinate might not necessarily form a rectangle with two other points with the same x-coordinate unless all four points have the same color.
- The new solution fixes these issues by carefully matching points with the same x-coordinate and ensuring they can form a rectangle with other points with the same y-coordinate, taking the color into consideration.

By rewriting the solution with the correct logic to match points and count rectangles, the output should now match the expected result.

The issue with the previous solutions is that they did not correctly identify pairs of points to form rectangles and also did not account for the necessity of matching pairs by both x and y coordinates with the same color.

To fix this, we will go with a different approach:

1. For each color, find all vertical pairs of points with the same x-coordinate.
2. For each pair of vertical points, look for horizontal pairs with the same y-coordinates to form the corners of a rectangle.
3. Count each unique rectangle formed by these pairs.

Here's the corrected Python code with the proper logic to count the rectangles:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as file:
    N, MaxC = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    points_by_color = {c: [] for c in range(1, MaxC + 1)}
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y, c = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        points_by_color[c].append((x, y))

# Count the rectangles for each color
correct_rectangles = 0
for color in points_by_color:
    points = points_by_color[color]
    # Create a dictionary to store points by x and by y for quick lookup
    points_by_x = {}
    points_by_y = {}
    for x, y in points:
        if x not in points_by_x:
            points_by_x[x] = []
        if y not in points_by_y:
            points_by_y[y] = []
        points_by_x[x].append(y)
        points_by_y[y].append(x)
        
    # Sort the lists for binary search
    for y in points_by_y:
        points_by_y[y].sort()
    
    # Find rectangles
    for x in points_by_x:
        if len(points_by_x[x]) < 2:  # Need at least 2 points to form a rectangle vertically
            continue
        for i in range(len(points_by_x[x])):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(points_by_x[x])):
                y1 = points_by_x[x][i]
                y2 = points_by_x[x][j]
                # Check if there is a horizontal pair that can close the rectangle
                if y1 in points_by_y and y2 in points_by_y:
                    common_x = set(points_by_y[y1]).intersection(points_by_y[y2])
                    correct_rectangles += len(common_x)

# Each rectangle is counted twice (once for each pair of vertical points), so divide by 2
correct_rectangles //= 2

# Write to the output file
with open('dreptc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(correct_rectangles) + '\n')
```

Explanation of the differences:

- The previous solutions did not properly account for matching vertical pairs with horizontal pairs to form rectangles.
- The previous solutions attempted a counting strategy that didn't correctly handle the uniqueness of rectangles and the requirement that all four corners match in color.
- The new solution fixes these issues by maintaining a proper structure to look up potential horizontal and vertical pairs for each color and then counting each unique rectangle formed by these pairs exactly once.

With this corrected solution, the output should match the expected result of "3" for the provided input.

The previous solution still contains a bug that causes overcounting of rectangles. The intersection of `x` coordinates for the horizontal line segments formed by `y1` and `y2` did not account for excluding the current `x` being considered, leading to rectangles being counted multiple times.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that when we find common `x` coordinates that complete the rectangle, we exclude the `x` coordinate of the vertical line segment we are considering. Let's implement a new solution that correctly counts the number of rectangles.

Here is the correct solution:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as file:
    N, MaxC = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    points_by_color = {c: [] for c in range(1, MaxC + 1)}
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y, c = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        points_by_color[c].append((x, y))

# Count the rectangles for each color
correct_rectangles = 0
for color, points in points_by_color.items():
    y_coords = {}
    # Group points by y-coordinate
    for x, y in points:
        if y not in y_coords:
            y_coords[y] = []
        y_coords[y].append(x)
    
    # Sort the x-coordinates for each y
    for y in y_coords:
        y_coords[y].sort()
    
    # Count rectangles by choosing two different y-coordinates and finding common x-coordinates
    ys = sorted(y_coords.keys())
    for i in range(len(ys)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(ys)):
            common_xs = set(y_coords[ys[i]]) & set(y_coords[ys[j]])
            correct_rectangles += len(common_xs) * (len(common_xs) - 1) // 2

# Write to the output file
with open('dreptc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(correct_rectangles) + '\n')
```

In this solution, we:

1. Group points by their y-coordinate for each color, creating a dictionary `y_coords` where each key is a y-coordinate and its value is the sorted list of x-coordinates for that y-coordinate.
2. Iterate over all pairs of different y-coordinates (`ys[i]` and `ys[j]`).
3. Count the common x-coordinates between these pairs of y-coordinates using set intersection (`common_xs`).
4. For each common x-coordinate, count the number of pairs it forms with other x-coordinates, which corresponds to the number of rectangles (`len(common_xs) * (len(common_xs) - 1) // 2`).
5. Sum these counts to get the total number of rectangles.

This approach correctly pairs vertical line segments with horizontal line segments and ensures that we only count unique rectangles. It should now produce the expected output for the given input.
