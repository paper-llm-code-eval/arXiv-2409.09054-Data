Copa ajunse în Orintia unde există un templu cu mai multe nivele, baza fiind un pătrat de lungime $L$. Primul nivel are înălţimea egală cu $N$, iar celelalte nivele au înălţimea mai mare cu o unitate faţă de cel anterior. Spre exemplu pentru $L = 5$ şi $N = 3$ din stâncă răsări templul (imagine din avion şi de la sol): Copa deschise un document vechi şi citi: „Ca să afli cât aur este în templu, trebuie să însumezi numărul de metri de pe fiecare orizontală…”. Şi Copa socoti: $3+3+3+3+3=15$; $3+4+4+4+3=18$; $3+4+5+4+3=19$; celelalte $18$ şi $15$. „Apoi, trebuie să afli suma numerelor obţinute…”. Iar Copa îşi notă numărul $85$. „Toate numerele obţinute se lipesc pentru a forma cel mai mic număr posibil…”. Şi Copa obţinu numărul: $151518181985$. „Din numărul acesta se caută cel mai mare număr de două cifre alăturate. Aceasta este cantitatea de aur din templu.”. Şi Copa ţipă de bucurie: $98$!.

Certainly! Here is the corrected solution, following the restrictions provided:

```python
# Read the input data from 'templu.in'
with open('templu.in', 'r') as file:
    N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the sum for each horizontal line and concatenate into a string
sum_string = ""
for level in range(L):
    mid_value = N + level
    sum_value = (mid_value * 2 + (L - 2) * (mid_value - 1)) * 2
    sum_string += str(sum_value)

# Sort the sums to form the smallest possible number
sorted_sums = ''.join(sorted(sum_string))

# Find the biggest two-digit number from the concatenated string
max_double_digit = max(int(sorted_sums[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(sorted_sums) - 1))

# Write the calculated numbers to 'templu.out'
with open('templu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sorted_sums}\n{max_double_digit}\n")
```

This code snippet will read $N$ and $L$ from the file `templu.in`, calculate the necessary sums, sort them to create the smallest possible number, find the largest two-digit value, and write the output to `templu.out`.

The problem in the previous solution arises from incorrectly calculating the sum of each horizontal line and then incorrectly sorting the string representation of the sums. The sum of each horizontal line should be calculated by considering that each level of the temple increases in height by one from the outer to the inner part. The concatenation of sums should not be sorted, as we want to preserve the order of sums as they are calculated from top to bottom.

Let's re-implement the solution with these corrections:

```python
# Read the input data from 'templu.in'
with open('templu.in', 'r') as file:
    N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the sum for each horizontal line
sums_str = ""
for i in range(L):
    outer_layer = N + i
    sum = outer_layer * 2 + (L - 2) * (outer_layer + 1)
    sums_str += str(sum)

# Find the biggest two-digit number from the concatenated string
max_double_digit = max(int(sums_str[j:j+2]) for j in range(len(sums_str) - 1))

# Write the calculated numbers to 'templu.out'
with open('templu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sums_str}\n{max_double_digit}\n")
```

This code snippet should now correctly calculate the sum for each horizontal line and find the largest two-digit number within the concatenated sum string. The output is written to `templu.out` as required.

The previous solution still contains a mistake in the calculation of the sum for each horizontal line. The pattern of the temple's horizontal sum is such that the middle number increases by one for each row as we move inwards, and the sides always have the starting number N. The sum should be calculated by summing each row's pattern correctly. The concatenation of sums should represent the temple's structure as described from top to bottom, and we should not sort the sums.

Let's correct the sum calculation and implement the solution accordingly:

```python
with open('templu.in', 'r') as file:
    N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the sum string and the variable to track the largest two-digit number
sums_str = ""
max_double_digit = 0

# Calculate the sum for each horizontal line and update the largest two-digit number
for layer_offset in range(L):
    # Compute the current layer height
    layer_height = N + layer_offset
    # Initialize sum for the current horizontal line
    horizontal_sum = 0
    for pos in range(L):
        if pos == 0 or pos == L - 1:
            horizontal_sum += N  # Add the base height N for the sides
        else:
            horizontal_sum += layer_height  # Add the layer height for the middle
    # Append the horizontal sum to the sum string
    sums_str += str(horizontal_sum)
    # Update the largest two-digit number if a larger one is found
    if layer_offset < L - 1:  # Only check if there is a next number to form two digits
        two_digit_num = int(sums_str[-2:])
        if two_digit_num > max_double_digit:
            max_double_digit = two_digit_num

# Write the calculated numbers to 'templu.out'
with open('templu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sums_str}\n{max_double_digit}\n")
```

This code now correctly calculates the sum of each horizontal line following the temple structure, updates the largest two-digit number while forming the sum string, and writes the result to the `templu.out` file.

I apologize for the confusion. Upon further analysis, the calculation of the sum for each horizontal line seems to be incorrect in the previous implementations. The approach should correctly reflect the pattern described in the problem statement, where each level's height increases by one unit from the base to the top, and the same pattern is mirrored horizontally.

Let's correct the algorithm to adhere to this pattern and implement the solution:

```python
with open('templu.in', 'r') as file:
    N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())

total_sum_string = ""
for level in range(L):
    # Calculate the sum for this level
    sum_level = 0
    for i in range(L):
        # The height increases by one unit for each level inward, but not beyond the center
        sum_level += N + min(i, level, L - i - 1, L - level - 1)
    # Add this level's sum to the total sum string
    total_sum_string += str(sum_level)

# Now, find the largest two-digit number in the total sum string
max_double_digit = max(int(total_sum_string[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(total_sum_string) - 1))

# Write the final results to 'templu.out'
with open('templu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum_string}\n{max_double_digit}\n")
```

This code should now properly calculate the sums for each horizontal line according to the pattern given in the problem description and find the maximum two-digit number in the concatenated sum string. It will then write the results to the `templu.out` file as intended.

To address the issue, we must ensure that the sum for each horizontal line is calculated correctly according to the specified pattern. The pattern starts with a row of 'N', followed by a row that has 'N' on the edges and 'N+1' in between, and so on, incrementing the middle value by one each time until the center of the square is reached.

Once we have the correct pattern, we concatenate the sums of each horizontal line, and then we must find the largest two-digit number from this concatenated string.

Here is the revised and corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from 'templu.in'
with open('templu.in', 'r') as file:
    N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())

def calculate_horizontal_sum(N, L, level):
    # Start with the corners which are always N
    horizontal_sum = N * 2
    # Middle part which starts with N and increases by 1 for each level up to the middle
    for i in range(1, L-1):
        horizontal_sum += N + min(level, i, L - 1 - i)
    return horizontal_sum

# Calculate the total sum string
total_sum_string = ""
for level in range(N, N + L):
    horizontal_sum = calculate_horizontal_sum(N, L, level - N)
    total_sum_string += str(horizontal_sum)

# Find the maximum two-digit number in the total sum string
max_double_digit = max(int(total_sum_string[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(total_sum_string) - 1))

# Write the final results to 'templu.out'
with open('templu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum_string}\n{max_double_digit}\n")
```

This solution carefully constructs the sum pattern for each level, concatenates these to form the total sum string, and then finds the largest two-digit number within it. The results are then written to `templu.out` as required.

I apologize for the oversight. The correct approach is to calculate the sum by layers, where each layer has a constant height, and each level above it increases by 1. We iterate from the bottom layer, which has a height of N, to the top, which has a height of N+L-1. For each layer, the sum must account for the full height in the middle and N at the edges. Then we concatenate these sums as strings and look for the largest two-digit number in the concatenated string.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from 'templu.in'
with open('templu.in', 'r') as file:
    N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the total sum string and the maximum double-digit string
sums_str = ""
max_double_digit = "00"

# Calculate and append the sums for each level
for level in range(L):
    # Start and end of each level are always N
    level_sum = N * 2
    # Middle sections increase in height from the base N to N + level each side
    middle_height = N + level
    level_sum += (L - 2) * middle_height
    sums_str += str(level_sum)

    # Update the largest two-digit number if the last two characters form a larger number
    if sums_str[-2:] > max_double_digit:
        max_double_digit = sums_str[-2:]

# The last iteration does not necessarily produce a valid two-digit number, so we check the second to last as well
if L > 1 and sums_str[-3:-1] > max_double_digit:
    max_double_digit = sums_str[-3:-1]

# Write the final results to 'templu.out'
with open('templu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sums_str}\n{max_double_digit}\n")
```

This solution now calculates the sum for each level accurately, concatenates these sums to form the total sum string, and correctly identifies the largest two-digit number, which is written to `templu.out` along with the total sum string.
