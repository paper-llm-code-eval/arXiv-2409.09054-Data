Copa ajunse în Orintia unde există un templu cu mai multe nivele, baza fiind un pătrat de lungime $L$. Primul nivel are înălţimea egală cu $N$, iar celelalte nivele au înălţimea mai mare cu o unitate faţă de cel anterior. Spre exemplu pentru $L = 5$ şi $N = 3$ din stâncă răsări templul (imagine din avion şi de la sol): Copa deschise un document vechi şi citi: „Ca să afli cât aur este în templu, trebuie să însumezi numărul de metri de pe fiecare orizontală…”. Şi Copa socoti: $3+3+3+3+3=15$; $3+4+4+4+3=18$; $3+4+5+4+3=19$; celelalte $18$ şi $15$. „Apoi, trebuie să afli suma numerelor obţinute…”. Iar Copa îşi notă numărul $85$. „Toate numerele obţinute se lipesc pentru a forma cel mai mic număr posibil…”. Şi Copa obţinu numărul: $151518181985$. „Din numărul acesta se caută cel mai mare număr de două cifre alăturate. Aceasta este cantitatea de aur din templu.”. Şi Copa ţipă de bucurie: $98$!.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read from templu.in
with open('templu.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate the sum for each horizontal line in the temple and store them as strings
sums = []
current_height = N
for i in range(L):
    horizontal_sum = current_height * 2 + (L - 2) * (current_height + 1)
    sums.append(str(horizontal_sum))
    current_height += 1

# Concatenate all the sums to form the big number
big_number = ''.join(sums)

# Find the maximum two adjacent digits
max_gold = max(int(big_number[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(big_number) - 1))

# Write the results to templu.out
with open('templu.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{big_number}\n{max_gold}\n')
```

This code should efficiently solve the problem by calculating the sums row by row and then concatenating them into one big number. It then finds the maximum two adjacent digits in this big number to find the quantity of gold. All file operations are done using file reading and writing without the use of `input()` or `print()`.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it is clear that the code is not correctly computing the sums of the horizontal lines as described in the challenge. The algorithm used to calculate the horizontal sums is incorrect.

In the given example, the sums should be calculated as follows for each horizontal line (following the pattern from the challenge description):
- $3+3+3+3+3=15$ (for the bottom line)
- $3+4+4+4+3=18$ (one level up)
- $3+4+5+4+3=19$ (and so on)
- $18$ (second to top line, with the same pattern as the second line but inverted)
- $15$ (top line, same as bottom line)

But the provided code calculates the sums incorrectly. It incorrectly assumes that the increments between adjacent cells within the same horizontal line are always 1, which is not true for the cells at the edges of each line.

Let us correct the approach:
1. Compute the sums of each horizontal line correctly, taking into account that the edge cells do not increase by 1.
2. Concatenate all the sums to form the big number as a string.
3. Iterate through the string to find the maximum two adjacent digits for the gold quantity.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from templu.in
with open('templu.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate the sum for each horizontal line in the temple and store them as strings
sums = []
current_height = N
increment = 0
for i in range(L // 2):
    line_sum = current_height * L + increment * (L - 2)
    sums.append(str(line_sum))
    current_height += 1
    increment += 2
if L % 2 == 1:  # Central line for odd L
    line_sum = current_height * L + increment * (L - 2)
    sums.append(str(line_sum))
    current_height += 1
# Add the sums of the top half of the temple, which are symmetrical to the bottom half
sums.extend(sums[-(L // 2 + L % 2) - 1::-1])

# Concatenate all the sums to form the big number
big_number = ''.join(sums)

# Find the maximum two adjacent digits
max_gold = max(int(big_number[i:i + 2]) for i in range(len(big_number) - 1))

# Write the results to templu.out
with open('templu.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{big_number}\n{max_gold}\n')
```

This corrected solution should now compute the sums of the horizontal lines accurately and find the correct maximum two adjacent digits in the big number, resulting in the expected output for the input provided.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it is clear that the corrected code still does not correctly compute the sums of the horizontal lines as described in the challenge.

In the given example, the sums should be calculated layer by layer, with the edges increasing by 1 only for the sides perpendicular to the observer (not for the entire perimeter of each layer). The approach used in the previous solution incorrectly calculated the sums by adding increments uniformly around the edges.

Let us re-evaluate the correct approach for calculating the sums:
- For each horizontal layer, the edges increase by 1 only for the vertical sides when viewed from the front, not for the corners or the horizontal sides at the back (which are not visible from the front).
- We need to concatenate the sums into a string, maintaining the order from bottom to top layer.
- Iterate through the concatenated string to find the maximum two adjacent digits.

Here is the corrected solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
# Read from templu.in
with open('templu.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Compute the initial sum for the base level
base_sum = N * L
sums = [str(base_sum)]

# Compute sums for the upper levels
for level in range(1, L):
    # Calculate the increase due to the side walls (each side wall contributes to the increase of the sum by 'level')
    side_increase = level * (L - 2) * 2
    # The corners do not increase as they are not visible in the front elevation
    level_sum = base_sum + side_increase
    sums.append(str(level_sum))

# Concatenate all sums, duplicating them symmetrically except for the central sum if L is odd
if L % 2 == 1:  # For odd L, the middle level is unique and not duplicated
    big_number = ''.join(sums + sums[-2::-1])
else:           # For even L, all levels are duplicated symmetrically
    big_number = ''.join(sums + sums[::-1])

# Find the maximum two adjacent digits
max_gold = max(int(big_number[i:i + 2]) for i in range(len(big_number) - 1))

# Write the results to templu.out
with open('templu.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{big_number}\n{max_gold}\n')
```

This solution should correctly compute the sums of the horizontal lines by considering only the side walls for the increase in sum at each level and then find the correct maximum two adjacent digits in the big number, resulting in the expected output for the input provided.

It seems my previous solutions were incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the mistake.

According to the description, each level of the temple is a square ring with the outer height increasing by one unit compared to the previous level. The sum for each horizontal line of sight is the sum of the heights of the visible parts of this ring from that view.

The mistake in previous solutions was the assumption that the increments were added to the entire perimeter or were incorrectly doubled.

Let's implement the solution with the correct logic:

1. Calculate the sum of the visible heights for each horizontal line.
2. The bottom and top horizontal lines will always have a sum of `N * L`.
3. The intermediate horizontal lines will have the corner values equal to `N`, and the values between them will increment by 1 up to the midpoint, and then decrement by 1 symmetrically.
4. Concatenate these sums to form the big number.
5. Find the maximum two adjacent digits in the big number.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from templu.in
with open('templu.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize the big number as a string
big_number = ''

# Calculate the sums for the horizontal lines
for row in range(1, L + 1):
    # First and last rows are just N * L
    if row == 1 or row == L:
        big_number += str(N * L)
    else:
        # For intermediate rows, calculate the sum by adding 1 to each inner block
        inner_blocks = (L - 2) * 2
        intermediate_sum = N * 2
        for i in range(1, (inner_blocks // 2) + 1):
            intermediate_sum += (N + i) * 2
        big_number += str(intermediate_sum)

# Find the maximum two adjacent digits
max_gold = max(int(big_number[i:i + 2]) for i in range(len(big_number) - 1))

# Write the results to templu.out
with open('templu.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{big_number}\n{max_gold}\n')
```

This revised solution adheres to the rules described in the problem statement, and the algorithm used reflects the correct computation for each horizontal line's sum. It should now provide the expected output for the input provided.

The previous solutions did not correctly compute the sum of the visible heights for each horizontal line according to the pattern described in the challenge. Let's devise a correct plan and implement it:

- The bottom and top horizontal lines (viewed from the front) will indeed have a sum of `N * L`.
- For the intermediate horizontal lines, the values increase as you move toward the center line and decrease symmetrically on the other side, but only for the parts of the temple visible in the front elevation (not the rear).
- We should build each horizontal sum starting from the edges (which have height `N`) and incrementing toward the center, stopping before the increment would affect the rear-most layer (since it's not visible).
- Then, we reverse the process, decrementing by 1, simulating moving away from the center back toward the edges.
- Concatenate these sums to form the big number.
- The gold quantity is the maximum two adjacent digits in the big number.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
# Read from templu.in
with open('templu.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Function to calculate sum of a level
def calculate_level_sum(level, L, N):
    # Start with the corners
    level_sum = 4 * N
    # Add the sides without the corners
    level_sum += (L - 2) * (N + level) * 2
    return level_sum

# Calculate the sum for each horizontal line in the temple
sums = []
# Add the bottom level
sums.append(N * L)
# Calculate and add intermediate levels
for level in range(1, L - 1):
    level_sum = calculate_level_sum(level, L, N)
    sums.append(level_sum)
# Add the top level
sums.append(N * L)

# Concatenate all the sums to form the big number
big_number = ''.join(map(str, sums))

# Find the maximum two adjacent digits
max_gold = max(int(big_number[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(big_number)-1))

# Write the results to templu.out
with open('templu.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{big_number}\n{max_gold}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly compute the sum of the visible heights for each horizontal line, concatenate them into a big number, and find the maximum two adjacent digits, yielding the expected result for the given input.

The previous solutions have incorrectly calculated the sum of each horizontal line. The correct calculation should consider that for each horizontal layer above the first, the edge height increases by 1 for each layer as you move inwards, but only for the sides that are visible from the front. The corners do not increase as they are not visible from the front.

Let us re-evaluate the correct approach for calculating the sums:

1. The bottom and top horizontal lines will have a sum of `N * L`.
2. For the intermediate horizontal lines, the sum will consist of the outermost blocks with height `N`, and then as we move inward, the height increases by 1 for each layer we step inward, but only for `L-2` blocks since the corners do not increase.
3. Concatenate these sums to form the big number, ensuring that the sums for symmetric layers are the same.
4. Find the maximum two adjacent digits in the big number.

Here is a corrected solution with a fixed algorithm to calculate the sums correctly:

```python
# Read from templu.in
with open('templu.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Function to calculate the sum for each horizontal layer
def calculate_layer_sum(N, L, height):
    # Corners remain the same, calculate the middle part which increases
    return N * 2 + (height * 2) * (L - 2)

# Initialize the big number as a string
big_number = ''

# Calculate the sum for the bottom layer (which is also the same for the top layer)
bottom_top_sum = N * L
big_number += str(bottom_top_sum)

# Calculate the sums for the intermediate layers
for i in range(1, L-1):
    layer_sum = calculate_layer_sum(N, L, N+i)
    big_number += str(layer_sum)

# Add the sum for the top layer (same as the bottom layer)
big_number += str(bottom_top_sum)

# Find the maximum two adjacent digits
max_gold = 0
for i in range(len(big_number) - 1):
    max_gold = max(max_gold, int(big_number[i:i+2]))

# Write the results to templu.out
with open('templu.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{big_number}\n{max_gold}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly compute the sum of the visible heights for each horizontal line, concatenate them into the big number in order from bottom to top, and find the maximum two adjacent digits, yielding the expected result for the given input.

The previous solutions have failed to correctly calculate the sums for each horizontal line, particularly for the intermediate lines. The main issue was not correctly calculating the pattern of the increments and decrements in height for the inner blocks as you move inwards from the edges.

Here is the correct approach to solve the problem:

1. For the bottom and top rows (first and last horizontal lines in the view), the sum is simply `N * L`.
2. For the intermediate rows, we start with the outer blocks (height `N`), then add increments as we go toward the center, and decrease as we move away from the center. We do this only for `L - 2` blocks, as the corners are not visible from the front.
3. We append each sum to a string to form the big number.
4. After obtaining the big number, we search for the maximum two adjacent digits.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from templu.in
with open('templu.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize the big number as a string and calculate the sums
big_number = ''
sums = [N * L]  # The sum for the bottom row

# Calculate the sum for the intermediate rows
for level in range(1, L - 1):
    # Each intermediate level sum starts with the two outer blocks at height N
    level_sum = N * 2
    # The inner blocks start at N+1 and increment by 1 each time until the row before the middle of the temple
    for increment in range(1, level + 1):
        level_sum += (N + increment) * 2
    # Add the sum of the level to the list of sums
    sums.append(level_sum)

# The sum for the top row is the same as the bottom row
sums.append(N * L)

# Convert sums to string and concatenate to form the big number
big_number = ''.join(str(sum_value) for sum_value in sums)

# Find the maximum two adjacent digits in the big number
max_gold = max(int(big_number[i:i + 2]) for i in range(len(big_number) - 1))

# Write the results to templu.out
with open('templu.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{big_number}\n{max_gold}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the sum for each horizontal line and find the maximum two adjacent digits in the big number, and thus provide the expected output for the given input.
