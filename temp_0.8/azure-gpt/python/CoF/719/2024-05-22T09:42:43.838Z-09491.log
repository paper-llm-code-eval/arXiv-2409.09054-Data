Copa ajunse în Orintia unde există un templu cu mai multe nivele, baza fiind un pătrat de lungime $L$. Primul nivel are înălţimea egală cu $N$, iar celelalte nivele au înălţimea mai mare cu o unitate faţă de cel anterior. Spre exemplu pentru $L = 5$ şi $N = 3$ din stâncă răsări templul (imagine din avion şi de la sol): Copa deschise un document vechi şi citi: „Ca să afli cât aur este în templu, trebuie să însumezi numărul de metri de pe fiecare orizontală…”. Şi Copa socoti: $3+3+3+3+3=15$; $3+4+4+4+3=18$; $3+4+5+4+3=19$; celelalte $18$ şi $15$. „Apoi, trebuie să afli suma numerelor obţinute…”. Iar Copa îşi notă numărul $85$. „Toate numerele obţinute se lipesc pentru a forma cel mai mic număr posibil…”. Şi Copa obţinu numărul: $151518181985$. „Din numărul acesta se caută cel mai mare număr de două cifre alăturate. Aceasta este cantitatea de aur din templu.”. Şi Copa ţipă de bucurie: $98$!.

The previous solution has a couple of problems:

1. The way the sums are being calculated is incorrect. The problem requires the sums to be computed with increasing values from the center of the matrix, not with a simple pattern. This means the method of calculating the horizontal sums must be adjusted.
2. The concatenation of sums should not be sorted to form the smallest possible number. The concatenated sums should be in the order they are computed.
3. The calculation of the largest two-digit number is correct, but it should be based on the concatenated sums in their original order.

Let's rewrite the solution with these issues fixed:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('templu.in') as f:
    N, L = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Function to calculate the sum of each horizontal level
def level_sum(N, L, level):
    return N * L + level * (L - 1 - level) * 4

# Calculate the sums for each horizontal level and concatenate them
concatenated_sums = ''
for level in range(L // 2):
    concatenated_sums += str(level_sum(N, L, level))
if L % 2 == 1:  # If L is odd, add the middle row sum
    concatenated_sums += str(level_sum(N, L, L // 2))

# Determine the largest two-digit number within the concatenated sums
max_two_digit_number = max(int(concatenated_sums[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(concatenated_sums) - 1))

# Write output to file
with open('templu.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(concatenated_sums + '\n')
    f.write(str(max_two_digit_number) + '\n')
```

This solution accounts for the increasing height of each layer above the base and concatenates the sums in the order they were computed. It then correctly identifies the largest two-digit number as required.

The previous solution still does not calculate the sums correctly. The horizontal sums should be calculated based on the increasing heights of the levels starting from the outer edges towards the center. Here's the correct approach:

1. Consider the base level with height `N` and calculate the sum for the top and bottom rows, which are straightforward since they consist entirely of blocks with height `N`.
2. For the interior rows, calculate the sum considering that the height increases by 1 for each level above the base as we move towards the center from the edges.
3. The middle row (if `L` is odd) or the two middle rows (if `L` is even) will have the tallest blocks.
4. Concatenate the sums in the order they are computed without sorting.
5. Find the largest two-digit number within the concatenated sums.

Let me rewrite the solution applying these fixes:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('templu.in') as f:
    N, L = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Calculate the sums for each horizontal level
sums = []
current_height = N
# Calculate the sum for the upper and lower rows (which are the same)
top_bottom_sum = current_height * L
sums.append(top_bottom_sum)

# Calculate the sums for the middle rows
for i in range(1, L - 1):
    # Sides of the row have the base height
    middle_sum = current_height * 2
    # The remaining blocks are higher by one level
    middle_sum += (L - 2) * (current_height + 1)
    sums.append(middle_sum)
    # Increase the height for the next level if we are not at the center yet
    if i < L // 2:
        current_height += 1

# If L is even, the two center rows are the same, so we repeat the sum
if L % 2 == 0:
    sums.append(middle_sum)

# Add the sum for the bottom row (same as the top)
sums.append(top_bottom_sum)

# Concatenate the sums to form the smallest possible number
concatenated_sums = ''.join(str(sum) for sum in sums)

# Determine the largest two-digit number within the concatenated sums
max_two_digit_number = max(int(concatenated_sums[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(concatenated_sums) - 1))

# Write output to file
with open('templu.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(concatenated_sums + '\n')
    f.write(str(max_two_digit_number) + '\n')
```

This solution should now calculate the sums correctly and find the largest two-digit number according to the problem's description.

The solution provided still does not match the expected output because the way the sums for each row are being calculated is incorrect. The issue lies in not properly handling the increase in height from the outer edge towards the center of each row.

Here is the corrected approach:

1. The sum of each row starts with the value `N` for each column (total `N * L`).
2. From the second row until the center, the sum increases by 2 for each row (since both the left and right sides increase by 1). The middle row will have the highest sum.
3. After calculating the sums for each row, concatenate them to form a string without sorting.
4. Search for the largest two-digit number within the concatenated string.

Let's rewrite the solution with these corrections:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('templu.in') as f:
    N, L = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Calculate the sums for each horizontal level
sums = []

# Top row (level 0) will always have N * L
sums.append(N * L)

# Calculate sums for subsequent rows until the middle
for i in range(1, L - 1):
    middle_value = N + i  # Middle value for current level
    row_sum = middle_value * L  # Start with all middle values
    row_sum -= 2 * sum(range(1, i + 1))  # Subtract excess from the ends
    sums.append(row_sum)

# Bottom row (the same as the top row)
sums.append(N * L)

# Form the concatenated sums string
concatenated_sums = ''.join(str(sum) for sum in sums)

# Determine the largest two-digit number within the concatenated sums
max_two_digit_number = '00'
for i in range(len(concatenated_sums) - 1):
    two_digit_number = concatenated_sums[i:i+2]
    if two_digit_number > max_two_digit_number:
        max_two_digit_number = two_digit_number

# Write output to file
with open('templu.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(concatenated_sums + '\n')
    f.write(max_two_digit_number + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly handle the specified rules for summing each horizontal level and result in the expected output.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's review the algorithm and correct the issues:

1. We must calculate each horizontal level sum taking into account the increasing height from the outer edges towards the center. Since the height increase for each level above the base is uniform and symmetrical, we can calculate it by adding the base height `N` for each block and then adding an increment for each block that is not on the outermost edge.

2. Once the sums are calculated, we concatenate them without sorting to form the number representing the total gold in the temple.

3. Finally, we find the largest two-digit number within that concatenated string.

Let's implement a corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('templu.in') as f:
    N, L = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Initialize the total sum string and the maximum gold amount
total_sum_str = ''
max_gold = 0

# Calculate the sum for each horizontal layer
for layer in range(L):
    # Initialize the sum for this layer
    layer_sum = 0
    
    # Calculate the sum for this layer
    for i in range(L):
        # Height increases as we move towards the center from the edges
        height = N + min(i, L - 1 - i, layer, L - 1 - layer)
        layer_sum += height
    
    # Convert to string and append to the total sum string
    total_sum_str += str(layer_sum)

    # Update the maximum gold amount if a higher two-digit number is found
    if layer < L - 1:  # No need to check the last layer as it won't have two digits following
        # Check two digits starting from the last digit of the current layer sum
        gold_candidate = int(str(layer_sum)[-1] + str(layer_sum + 1)[0])
        max_gold = max(max_gold, gold_candidate)

# Write output to file
with open('templu.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(total_sum_str + '\n')
    f.write(str(max_gold) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution should now properly calculate the sums for each horizontal level considering the height increase, concatenate them correctly to form the total gold string, and find the largest two-digit number within that string, which is the required gold quantity.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the sum calculation and ensure we properly determine the largest two-digit number:

1. Calculate each horizontal level's sum by considering the increase in height from the edges toward the center, accounting for the increase in height by one unit for each level above the base.
2. Concatenate the sums in their natural order, without sorting, to form the number representing the total gold in the temple.
3. Find the largest adjacent two-digit number within the concatenated sums.

Here is the updated solution with these corrections:

```python
# Read data from the input file
with open('templu.in') as f:
    N, L = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Function to calculate the sum for a given row
def calculate_row_sum(N, L, row):
    # The middle block height will be N plus the minimum of the row number and L-1-row (for symmetry)
    middle_height = N + min(row, L - 1 - row)
    row_sum = middle_height * L  # Start with the middle height for all blocks
    # Subtract the excess from blocks that are not at the middle height
    for i in range(1, (L + 1) // 2):
        row_sum -= 2 * max(middle_height - N - i, 0)
    return row_sum

# Initialize the string for sums and the maximum gold variable
sums_str = ""
max_gold = 0

# Calculate the sums for each horizontal level
for row in range(L):
    row_sum = calculate_row_sum(N, L, row)
    sums_str += str(row_sum)
    # Update the max_gold with the greatest two adjacent digits found so far
    if row < L - 1:  # Check only if there's a next row
        next_row_first_digit = str(calculate_row_sum(N, L, row + 1))[0]
        two_digits = int(str(row_sum)[-1] + next_row_first_digit)
        max_gold = max(max_gold, two_digits)

# Write the output to the file
with open('templu.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(sums_str + '\n')
    f.write(str(max_gold) + '\n')
```

This approach uses a function to calculate the sum for each row based on the given logic, then concatenates those sums and looks for the largest two-digit number formed by the last digit of the current sum and the first digit of the next sum, thus fixing the previous errors.
