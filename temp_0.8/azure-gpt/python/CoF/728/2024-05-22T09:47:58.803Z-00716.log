Vânătorul șef al regelui Arthur a primit însărcinare să vâneze primele rațe ce se întorc din țările calde. Regele fiind un tip cu idei fixe, i-a cerut vânătorului să vâneze rațele albe cu săgeți albe, iar rațele negre cu săgeți negre.

Rațele vin în rânduri (stoluri) din ce în ce mai mari: mai întâi una, apoi două, trei, cinci, opt, treisprezece, ș.a.m.d. Se observă că numărul de rațe dintr-un rând este egal cu numărul de rațe de pe cele două rânduri anterioare. Rațele fiind niște creaturi ordonate zboară în rânduri, în care nu vei putea găsi două rațe de aceeași culoare alăturate, fiecare rând începând cu o rață albă.

Vânătorul știe că dacă a început să doboare o rață, trebuie să le doboare pe toate de pe rândul acesteia, deoarece supraviețuitoarele vor alerta celelalte rațe și ele nu se vor mai întoarce niciodată, iar vânătorul nostru își va pierde slujba.

# Cerință

Știind că vânătorul a primit $ka$ săgeți albe și $kb$ săgeți negre, trebuie să determinați câte rânduri de rațe a doborât și câte săgeți de fiecare tip i-au rămas, știind că el vrea să-și păstreze slujba.

# Date de intrare

De pe primele două linii ale fișierului de intrare `vanatoare.in` se citesc numerele ka și kb (în această ordine).

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vanatoare.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul de rânduri doborâte
* pe linia a doua numărul de săgeți albe rămase
* pe linia a treia numărul de săgeți negre rămase

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq ka, kb \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;

Upon reviewing the initial solution and comparing the expected and found output, it becomes apparent that the algorithm has a logical flaw. It fails to calculate the correct number of rows accurately because it starts the Fibonacci sequence incorrectly, with 1 and 2 instead of 1 and 1. Let's correct the sequence and adjust the algorithm accordingly.

Here is the updated and corrected Python solution that should produce the expected results:

```python
def compute_ducks_and_arrows():
    with open("vanatoare.in", "r") as fin:
        ka = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of white arrows
        kb = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of black arrows

    prev = 0  # Previous number of ducks (initially 0 for the sequence start)
    current = 1  # Current number of ducks
    rows = 0  # Number of rows shot down

    while True:
        rows += 1
        # Calculate the next number of ducks in the row (Fibonacci sequence)
        next_row_ducks = prev + current

        # Number of white and black ducks in the current row
        num_white_ducks = current // 2
        num_black_ducks = current - num_white_ducks

        # Check if there are enough arrows to shoot down all ducks in the current row
        if ka >= num_white_ducks and kb >= num_black_ducks:
            ka -= num_white_ducks
            kb -= num_black_ducks
        else:
            rows -= 1
            break

        # Move to the next number in the sequence
        prev = current
        current = next_row_ducks

    with open("vanatoare.out", "w") as fout:
        fout.write(f"{rows}\n{ka}\n{kb}\n")

compute_ducks_and_arrows()
```

The corrected script takes into account the proper Fibonacci sequence, which starts with 1 and 1, and ensures that each row begins with a white duck, following the order specified in the prompt. It also calculates the number of white and black ducks correctly by dividing the total number of ducks in the current row by 2 and subtracting this from the total to get the number of black ducks. This fix should produce the expected result.

It seems that my earlier solution incorrectly handled the number of white and black ducks in the current row. According to the problem statement, each row always starts with a white duck and no two ducks of the same color are adjacent. This implies that if a row has an even number of ducks, then it will have an equal number of white and black ducks. However, if a row has an odd number of ducks, then it will have one more white duck than black ducks.

Let's write a new solution taking the above logic into account:

```python
def compute_ducks_and_arrows():
    with open("vanatoare.in", "r") as fin:
        ka = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of white arrows
        kb = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of black arrows

    # The sequence of ducks starts with 1
    prev = 0  # Previous number of ducks (initially 0 for the sequence start)
    current = 1  # Current number of ducks
    rows = 0  # Number of rows shot down

    # Continue until arrows run out
    while ka >= current // 2 and kb >= (current + 1) // 2:
        rows += 1
        # Subtract the number of arrows used to shoot the current row of ducks
        ka -= current // 2           # White ducks are half or one more than half of the total
        kb -= (current + 1) // 2     # Black ducks are the remaining ducks

        # Move to the next number in the sequence
        temp = current
        current = prev + current
        prev = temp

    with open("vanatoare.out", "w") as fout:
        fout.write(f"{rows}\n{ka}\n{kb}\n")

compute_ducks_and_arrows()
```

This solution correctly calculates the number of white and black ducks, ensuring that each row starts with a white duck and no two ducks of the same color are adjacent. It also correctly handles the case where the number of ducks in a row is odd by adding one more white duck. This algorithm should now give the expected output for the given input.

Upon re-evaluating the problem, it's clear that the previous solution did not correctly consider the fact that the rows of ducks have an alternating pattern of white and black ducks, beginning with a white duck. In an even-numbered row, there will be an equal number of white and black ducks. In an odd-numbered row, there will be one more white duck than black ducks.

The script also must ensure that it does not overshoot the number of arrows available. The previous solution prematurely increased `rows` before checking if there were enough arrows to shoot down the current row, which led to the incorrect output.

Let's correct the logic to accurately reflect these rules and ensure the proper calculation of the remaining arrows:

```python
def compute_ducks_and_arrows():
    with open("vanatoare.in", "r") as fin:
        ka = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of white arrows
        kb = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of black arrows

    # The sequence of ducks starts with 1
    prev = 1  # Previous number of ducks
    current = 1  # Current number of ducks
    rows = 0  # Number of rows shot down

    while True:
        # Calculate the number of white and black ducks in the current row
        white_ducks = (current + 1) // 2  # At least half are white ducks
        black_ducks = current // 2  # Remaining ducks are black

        # Check if there are enough arrows to shoot down the current row of ducks
        if ka >= white_ducks and kb >= black_ducks:
            # Subtract the arrows used
            ka -= white_ducks
            kb -= black_ducks
            rows += 1
        else:
            # Not enough arrows to shoot the next row
            break

        # Move to the next number in the sequence
        prev, current = current, prev + current

    with open("vanatoare.out", "w") as fout:
        fout.write(f"{rows}\n{ka}\n{kb}\n")

compute_ducks_and_arrows()
```

This solution now checks if there are enough arrows before shooting down the current row and correctly updates the number of arrows remaining. It should produce the expected output for any given input within the specified constraints.
