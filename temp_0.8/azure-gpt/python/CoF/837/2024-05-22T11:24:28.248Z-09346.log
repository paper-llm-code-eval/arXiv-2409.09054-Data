Andrei se descurcă foarte bine la geometrie și de aceea născocește tot felul de jocuri pe care le testează cu Alexandru, colegul său de bancă. Pentru a pregăti noul joc cu trei niveluri, Andrei desenează pe o foaie de matematică reperul cartezian xOy și mai multe puncte distincte. Fiecare punct desenat are atât abscisa $x$, cât și ordonata $y$, numere întregi.

La primul nivel, Alexandru determină numărul maxim de puncte (dintre cele desenate) aflate pe una dintre axele sistemului cartezian sau pe o dreaptă paralelă cu una dintre cele două axe.

La al doilea nivel, Alexandru consideră toate punctele desenate a căror abscisă $x$ și ordonată $y$ verifică cel puțin una dintre relațiile $x = y$ sau $x + y = 0$ și apoi calculează câte drepte distincte trec prin cel puțin două dintre aceste puncte.

La al treilea nivel, Alexandru numără și șterge punctele din $3$ în $3$ (primul, al $4$-lea, al $7$-lea etc.), începând cu cel mai din stânga punct desenat și continuând către dreapta. Dacă două sau mai multe puncte au aceeași abscisă, el le numără pe acestea de jos în sus (începând de la punctul cu ordonata cea mai mică). Când a ajuns cu număratul la cel mai din dreapta punct continuă cu cel mai din stânga punct rămas.

Alexandru se oprește cu numărarea și ștergerea când rămâne un singur punct desenat pe foaie.

The provided solution has a few mistakes:

1. The computation of `NRD` is incorrect. It should count the number of distinct lines that pass through at least two points satisfying either `x = y` or `x + y = 0`. The current solution is just counting the number of distinct `x` values for points on these lines, which is not correct. A line is defined by its slope and intercept, but since these are specific lines (45-degree and 135-degree angles), we can just count them directly.

2. The third level's logic is incorrect because it removes every third point based on the index in the sorted list, which doesn't take into account the actual removals in the previous iterations. After each removal, the indices of the remaining points change, so we need to correctly track which points to remove.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def read_and_solve():
    # Read input data
    with open('puncte.in', 'r') as fin:
        N = int(fin.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    # Level 1: Find the maximum number of points on an axis or parallel to an axis
    rows = defaultdict(int)
    cols = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        rows[y] += 1
        cols[x] += 1
    NRP = max(max(rows.values(), default=0), max(cols.values(), default=0))

    # Level 2: Count distinct lines through at least two points satisfying x = y or x + y = 0
    points_on_diagonals = [(x, y) for x, y in points if x == y or x + y == 0]
    diag_main_count = sum(1 for x, y in points_on_diagonals if x == y)
    diag_anti_count = sum(1 for x, y in points_on_diagonals if x + y == 0)
    NRD = diag_main_count if diag_main_count > 1 else 0
    NRD += diag_anti_count if diag_anti_count > 1 else 0

    # Level 3: Remove points in 3s and find the last remaining point's x-coordinate
    points_sorted = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))  # Sort by x, then by y
    idx_to_remove = 2
    while len(points_sorted) > 1:
        if len(points_sorted) > idx_to_remove:
            del points_sorted[idx_to_remove]
            idx_to_remove += 2  # After removing an element, skip the next two
        else:
            idx_to_remove %= len(points_sorted)
    XP = points_sorted[0][0]

    # Write output data
    with open('puncte.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n')

# Execute the function
read_and_solve()
```

This updated solution corrects the errors in the prior implementation. The `NRD` is now calculated by checking if there are more than one point on each of the two special diagonals (`x = y` and `x + y = 0`). For Level 3, instead of filtering out every third point based on the index, we remove the point by index and then update the index to remove, wrapping it around as necessary.

Let's address the two issues separately:

1. **Level 2 (NRD) calculation issue:**
   The correct approach requires counting the number of distinct lines, not the number of points on those lines. For the diagonals `x = y` and `x + y = 0`, each point on these diagonals defines a unique line, so we don't need to calculate the slope and intercept. However, we need to ensure that we only count lines that have at least two points on them. The previous solution added the counts directly without this check.

2. **Level 3 (XP) calculation issue:**
   The logic to remove every third point is not correctly implemented. We need a way to iterate over the points and remove every third point, considering the changes in the list after each removal.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def read_and_solve():
    # Read input data
    with open('puncte.in', 'r') as fin:
        N = int(fin.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    # Level 1: Find the maximum number of points on an axis or parallel to an axis
    rows = defaultdict(int)
    cols = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        rows[y] += 1
        cols[x] += 1
    NRP = max(max(rows.values(), default=0), max(cols.values(), default=0))

    # Level 2: Count distinct lines through at least two points satisfying x = y or x + y = 0
    NRD = sum(1 for x, y in points if x == y) > 1
    NRD += sum(1 for x, y in points if x + y == 0) > 1

    # Level 3: Remove points in 3s and find the last remaining point's x-coordinate
    points_sorted = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))  # Sort by x, then by y
    while len(points_sorted) > 1:
        # Remove every third point
        to_remove = [i for i in range(2, len(points_sorted), 3)]
        points_sorted = [p for i, p in enumerate(points_sorted) if i not in to_remove]
        # Adjust the start index for removal in the next pass
        to_remove_offset = (len(points_sorted) + 2) % 3
        # Create a new range with the adjusted offset
        to_remove = [(i - to_remove_offset) % len(points_sorted) for i in to_remove]
    XP = points_sorted[0][0]

    # Write output data
    with open('puncte.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n')

# Execute the function
read_and_solve()
```

This solution fixes Level 2 by adding conditionals that only increment `NRD` if there are more than one point on each diagonal. In Level 3, we calculate the indices of the points to be removed and then filter out those points. The offset is adjusted for each pass to account for the removals. This ensures that every third point is removed relative to the new list after each pass, which aligns with the game's rules as described in the challenge.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed because it was using too much memory or because the system needed to reclaim resources. In this case, it's likely due to excessive memory usage caused by the code, particularly in Level 3 where the list of points is being repeatedly copied and filtered.

To fix this, we need to optimize the Level 3 logic to avoid creating new lists on each iteration. We can do this with an in-place removal strategy which is more memory-efficient. Additionally, in Level 2, the calculation of NRD is incorrect as it should count the number of distinct lines that pass through at least two points. That means for each line equation, we need at least two points to consider it a valid line.

Let's rewrite the solution with these improvements:

```python
from collections import Counter

def read_and_solve():
    # Read input data
    with open('puncte.in', 'r') as fin:
        N = int(fin.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    # Level 1: Find the maximum number of points on an axis or parallel to an axis
    # Count points with same x (vertical lines) and same y (horizontal lines)
    rows = Counter(y for x, y in points)
    cols = Counter(x for x, y in points)
    NRP = max(rows.values() + cols.values(), default=0)

    # Level 2: Count distinct lines through at least two points satisfying x = y or x + y = 0
    # Count lines with points satisfying x = y (y intercept is 0) and x + y = 0 (y intercept is -x)
    diag_main = Counter(x for x, y in points if x == y)
    diag_anti = Counter(-x for x, y in points if x + y == 0)
    # Count lines that have more than one point
    NRD = sum(1 for count in diag_main.values() if count > 1) + sum(1 for count in diag_anti.values() if count > 1)

    # Level 3: Remove points in 3s and find the last remaining point's x-coordinate
    points_sorted = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))  # Sort by x, then by y
    while len(points_sorted) > 1:
        # Every third index after removals
        third_indices = range(2, len(points_sorted), 3)
        # Reverse the indices so we can remove from the end without affecting the others
        for index in reversed(third_indices):
            del points_sorted[index]
    XP = points_sorted[0][0]

    # Write output data
    with open('puncte.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n')

# Execute the function
read_and_solve()
```

In this solution, we have made use of the `Counter` class to efficiently count points on the same lines. In Level 3, we handle removal in-place by iterating over the indices in reverse order to avoid affecting the positions of elements that haven't been processed yet. These improvements should reduce memory usage and prevent the program from being killed with exit code 137.

The error in the code is due to the incorrect addition of `dict_values` objects. The `values()` method of a dictionary returns a view object that cannot be added directly with another. To fix this, we need to convert them to lists before adding or use a different method to calculate the maximum.

Here's the corrected solution taking into account the error:

```python
from collections import Counter

def read_and_solve():
    # Read input data
    with open('puncte.in', 'r') as fin:
        N = int(fin.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    # Level 1: Find the maximum number of points on an axis or parallel to an axis
    rows = Counter(y for x, y in points)
    cols = Counter(x for x, y in points)
    NRP = max(max(rows.values(), default=0), max(cols.values(), default=0))

    # Level 2: Count distinct lines through at least two points satisfying x = y or x + y = 0
    diag_main = Counter(x for x, y in points if x == y)
    diag_anti = Counter(x for x, y in points if x + y == 0)
    NRD = sum(1 for count in diag_main.values() if count > 1) + sum(1 for count in diag_anti.values() if count > 1)

    # Level 3: Remove points in 3s and find the last remaining point's x-coordinate
    points_sorted = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))  # Sort by x, then by y
    index = 2
    while len(points_sorted) > 1:
        # Remove the point at the current index
        points_sorted.pop(index)
        # Calculate the next index, adjusting for the removed element
        index = (index + 2) % len(points_sorted)
    XP = points_sorted[0][0]

    with open('puncte.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n')

# Execute the function
read_and_solve()
```

In this corrected solution, we calculate `NRP` by taking the maximum of the maximum values from rows and columns counters separately. Moreover, the Level 3 logic has been streamlined to remove every third point in a cyclic manner using the modulo operator to wrap around the index after each removal. This should now work correctly and efficiently for large datasets.

It seems the primary issue is with NRD calculation and XP's elimination logic. Let's address these issues step by step:

1. **NRD calculation issue:** The solution should be counting the number of distinct lines, so if there's at least one other point on the same line as a given point, that line should be counted. This requires checking if the counts are greater than 1 for points on the lines defined by `x = y` and `x + y = 0`.

2. **XP elimination logic issue:** The previous solution attempted to remove every third point cyclically, but it didn't properly handle the case where the list's length changes after each removal. We need a strategy that considers this change in length and correctly identifies the points to be removed according to the game's rules.

Here is the corrected solution that addresses these issues:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def read_and_solve():
    # Read input data
    with open('puncte.in', 'r') as fin:
        N = int(fin.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    # Level 1: Find the maximum number of points on an axis or parallel to an axis
    rows = defaultdict(int)
    cols = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        rows[y] += 1
        cols[x] += 1
    NRP = max(list(rows.values()) + list(cols.values()))

    # Level 2: Count distinct lines through at least two points satisfying x = y or x + y = 0
    diag_main = defaultdict(int)
    diag_anti = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        if x == y:
            diag_main[x] += 1
        elif x + y == 0:
            diag_anti[x] += 1
    NRD = sum(1 for count in diag_main.values() if count > 1) + sum(1 for count in diag_anti.values() if count > 1)

    # Level 3: Remove points in 3s and find the last remaining point's x-coordinate
    points_sorted = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))  # Sort by x, then by y
    index_to_remove = 2
    while len(points_sorted) > 1:
        points_sorted.pop(index_to_remove)
        # Skip 2 valid points after removal
        index_to_remove = (index_to_remove + 2) % len(points_sorted)
    XP = points_sorted[0][0]

    # Write output data
    with open('puncte.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n')

# Execute the function
read_and_solve()
```

In this solution, the NRD logic has been fixed to correctly count the number of distinct lines that pass through at least two points. For XP, we use modulo operation after each removal to cycle to the right index, considering the reduced length of the list. This should now yield the expected results given the input data.
