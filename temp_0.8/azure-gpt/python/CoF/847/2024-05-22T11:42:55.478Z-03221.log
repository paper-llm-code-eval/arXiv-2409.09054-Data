La proba de sărituri cu schiurile din cadrul jocurilor olimpice de iarnă participă $N$ concurenți, numerotați cu numere de la 1 la N.

Regulile de desfășurare a probei sunt următoarele:
- concurenții evoluează pe rând, în ordine de la $1$ la $N$;
- fiecare concurent va efectua o singură săritură;
- după efectuarea săriturii fiecare concurent primește un anumit punctaj;
- pe tot parcursul concursului, comisia de arbitri are obligația să alcătuiască o listă cu punctajele obținute de concurenți, în ordinea evoluției lor;
- evoluția unui concurent durează exact un minut;
- nu se face pauză între evoluțiile a doi concurenți care au numere de ordine consecutive;
- afișarea punctajului nu necesită timp suplimentar după efectuarea săriturii;
- proba se încheie la un minut după evoluția ultimului concurent.

Pe tot parcursul concursului se ține în mod neoficial și un clasament parțial, pe baza rezultatelor obținute de concurenții care au evoluat până în acel moment. Asta pentru că șeful comisiei de arbitri are o curiozitate aparte și pune $K$ întrebări sub forma următoare: Câte minute s-a ocupat primul loc din clasament cu un punctaj egal cu $X$ puncte? Dacă nici un concurent nu s-a clasat pe primul loc cu $X$ puncte atunci primește ca răspuns valoarea $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină răspunsul pentru fiecare dintre cele $K$ întrebări puse de șeful comisiei de arbitri.

# Date de intrare

În fișierul `schi.in`, pe prima linie este scris un număr natural, $N$ reprezentând numărul de concurenți. 
Pe a doua linie a fișierului sunt scrise cele $N$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând punctajele obținute de fiecare dintre cei $N$ concurenți, în ordinea în care aceștia au evoluat. Pe a treia linie a fișierului este scris numărul natural $K$ ce reprezintă numărul de întrebări puse de șef. Pe a patra linie a fișierului sunt scrise $K$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând valorile $X$ ale punctajelor alese de șeful comisiei de arbitri.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul `schi.out` se vor scrie $K$ numere, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând, în ordine, răspunsurile la cele $K$ întrebări.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq$ punctajele obținute de concurenți $\leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq$ valorile $X$ alese de șeful arbitrilor $\leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;

The provided solution has a flaw in the way it calculates the minutes for which a particular score has held the first place. The mapping `score_minutes` should track only the highest score at any given minute, but it is incorrectly updated for scores that are not the current maximum.

Upon further analysis, we realize that we need a different approach to solve the problem. The scoring must be processed in reverse order, starting from the last competitor to the first. Here's the correct algorithm:

1. Reverse the scores array to simulate the idea of maintaining the first place from last to first.
2. Use a segment tree or a binary indexed tree (BIT) to keep track of the scores and allow us to query the maximum value efficiently within a range.

However, for the sake of simplicity and the constraints given ($1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$), we can use a frequency array to keep track of the scores since the maximum possible score is $1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, which is too large for an array of that size. We will use a dictionary (hash map) to count the minutes for each unique score from last to first, along with a separate array to keep track of the maximum score at any given minute.

Let's rewrite the solution incorporating these changes:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        N = int(f.readline().strip())
        scores = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))
        K = int(f.readline().strip())
        X_values = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))
    return N, scores, K, X_values

def write_output(file_name, answers):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, answers)) + '\n')

def process_competition(N, scores, K, X_values):
    # Reverse the scores
    scores.reverse()
    
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the maximum score counter
    score_minutes = {}
    current_max = 0
    
    # Calculate the number of minutes each score has been the highest
    for score in scores:
        if score > current_max:
            current_max = score
        if current_max in score_minutes:
            score_minutes[current_max] += 1
        else:
            score_minutes[current_max] = 1
    
    # Calculate the answers for each query
    answers = [score_minutes.get(X, 0) for X in X_values]
    
    return answers

def main():
    N, scores, K, X_values = read_input('schi.in')
    answers = process_competition(N, scores, K, X_values)
    write_output('schi.out', answers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This revised solution implements the proposed algorithm and should produce the correct output. It reverses the scores array, uses a dictionary to track the minutes for each maximum score, and then answers the queries based on this information.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's correct the approach.

This problem actually requires an understanding of how long a given score is the maximum score during the competition. Since the competitors jump in order and their scores are fixed, we should process the scores in the original order and determine the number of minutes each score is the highest score up to that point.

Here's the correct algorithm:

1. Process each competitor's score in the original order, keeping track of the maximum score obtained so far.
2. For each score, maintain a count of how many minutes it has been the highest score. If a new score is higher than the current maximum, reset the count. If it matches the current maximum, increment the count.
3. Use a dictionary to map each possible score to the number of minutes it has been the maximum score.
4. For each question, look up the corresponding score in the dictionary to get the answer.

Let's rewrite the solution incorporating these changes:

```python
def process_competition(N, scores, K, X_values):
    # Dictionary to map scores to the number of minutes they've been the highest
    score_minutes = {}
    max_score = 0
    minutes = 0
    
    # Loop through the competitors' scores in the forward direction
    for score in scores:
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            minutes = 1  # Reset the minutes count for the new maximum score
        elif score == max_score:
            minutes += 1  # Increment if the current score ties with the max score
        score_minutes[max_score] = minutes  # Update the dictionary
    
    # Respond to the questions asked by the chief of the jury
    answers = []
    for X in X_values:
        if X in score_minutes:
            # Find the latest occurrence of that score as the highest
            answers.append(score_minutes[X])
        else:
            # If the score was never the highest, the answer is 0
            answers.append(0)
    
    return answers

# The rest of the code (read_input, write_output, and main) remains the same

# Run the main function to solve the problem
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution should now produce the correct output for the given input. It processes each competitor's score while keeping track of the highest score and its duration. This corrects the mistake of reversing the score array and not considering the longest duration of each score being the highest.

The error message in the standard error indicates that there is a `NameError` because the function `main()` is not defined. This is due to the fact that the `main()` function was mentioned in the if `__name__ == '__main__':` block, but it was not actually implemented in the provided solution.

To fix this error, we need to define the `main()` function that uses the `process_competition()` function along with `read_input()` and `write_output()` functions to read the input data, process it, and then write the output data. Here is the complete corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        N = int(f.readline().strip())
        scores = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))
        K = int(f.readline().strip())
        X_values = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))
    return N, scores, K, X_values

def write_output(file_name, answers):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, answers)) + '\n')

def process_competition(N, scores, K, X_values):
    # Dictionary to map scores to the number of minutes they've been the highest
    score_minutes = {}
    max_score = 0
    minutes = 0
    
    # Loop through the competitors' scores in the forward direction
    for score in scores:
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            minutes = 1  # Reset the minutes count for the new maximum score
        elif score == max_score:
            minutes += 1  # Increment if the current score ties with the max score
        score_minutes[max_score] = minutes  # Update the dictionary
    
    # Respond to the questions asked by the chief of the jury
    answers = []
    for X in X_values:
        if X in score_minutes:
            # Find the latest occurrence of that score as the highest
            answers.append(score_minutes[X])
        else:
            # If the score was never the highest, the answer is 0
            answers.append(0)
    
    return answers

def main():
    N, scores, K, X_values = read_input('schi.in')
    answers = process_competition(N, scores, K, X_values)
    write_output('schi.out', answers)

# Run the main function to solve the problem
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The above code defines the missing `main()` function, which orchestrates the reading of input, processing of the competition data, and writing of the output. It should now run without encountering a `NameError`.

The found output shows that the number of minutes each score occupied the first place is not calculated correctly. Specifically, the scores 6 and 8 are not showing the correct number of minutes they were the highest scores.

The issue here is due to misunderstanding the problem statement. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that if a score repeats and it is already the maximum, we just increment the counter for that score. However, what we should be doing is maintaining the minutes that each unique score was the highest score, even if it was not continuously the highest.

To fix this, we should adjust our algorithm to account for the total number of minutes each unique score has been the highest up to that point. This involves tracking the maximum score separately for each unique score, regardless of whether it's the current maximum.

Let's rewrite the solution with these necessary fixes:

```python
def main():
    with open('schi.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        scores = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        K = int(file.readline().strip())
        queries = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Initialize a dict to store the number of minutes each score was the highest
    highest_minutes = {}
    # List to track the highest score at each minute
    highest_scores = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Track the current maximum score and update highest_scores list
    current_max_score = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if scores[i] > current_max_score:
            current_max_score = scores[i]
        highest_scores[i + 1] = current_max_score
    
    # Count the number of minutes each score was the highest
    for i in range(N, 0, -1):
        score = scores[i - 1]
        if score not in highest_minutes:
            highest_minutes[score] = highest_scores[i] == score
        else:
            if highest_scores[i] == score:
                highest_minutes[score] += 1

    # Prepare the output based on the queries
    output = []
    for x in queries:
        output.append(highest_minutes.get(x, 0))

    # Write the output to the file
    with open('schi.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in output) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution considers each score individually and counts the total minutes it was the highest by moving backward through the list of scores. The `highest_scores` list is used to keep track of the highest score after every competitor's turn. When counting the minutes, we go in reverse to ensure we count all occurrences of a score being the highest score up to that point. This should now provide the correct output.

There's a mistake in the boolean check when initializing the `highest_minutes` dictionary. Instead of setting `True` or `False`, we should be setting the count to `1` if the score is the current maximum and initializing counts for scores that haven't been seen before. Moreover, we need to ensure that we correctly accumulate the number of minutes each score was the highest and only increment that number when the score at the current index is the maximum score seen so far (from the end to the beginning).

Let's correct the implementation:

```python
def main():
    # Read input
    with open('schi.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        scores = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        K = int(file.readline().strip())
        queries = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Dictionary to hold the number of minutes each score was the highest
    highest_minutes = {}
    # Variable to keep track of the current highest score
    current_max_score = 0
    # Variable to keep track of minutes the current highest score has been the highest
    minutes = 0
    
    # Process scores in reverse to calculate the highest_minutes
    for score in reversed(scores):
        if score > current_max_score:
            current_max_score = score
            minutes = 1
        else:
            if score == current_max_score:
                minutes += 1
        if score == current_max_score:
            highest_minutes[score] = minutes

    # Process queries and generate output
    output = [highest_minutes.get(query, 0) for query in queries]

    # Write output
    with open('schi.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, output)) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This corrected solution initializes and updates the `highest_minutes` dictionary appropriately, keeping track of the current maximum score and its duration in minutes. The number of minutes each score was the highest is accumulated correctly, and the output for each query is generated based on this information. This should yield the expected output.

The current logic is not correctly handling the tracking of minutes for each score, especially when a score is repeated. The main issue is that we are not considering that a score can become the highest again after it has been surpassed by another score.

To keep track of the times a certain score has been at the top, we should create a list that holds the maximum score at each minute. Then, for each score, we should find the last occurrence of that score in the list and count the number of consecutive minutes it was the highest score.

Let's correct the implementation:

```python
def main():
    # Read input
    with open('schi.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        scores = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        K = int(file.readline().strip())
        queries = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # List to store the highest score at each minute
    max_scores = [0] * N
    # Initialize max_score and iterate through scores updating max_scores
    max_score = 0
    for i, score in enumerate(scores):
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
        max_scores[i] = max_score

    # Dictionary to hold the number of minutes each score was the highest
    highest_minutes = {score: 0 for score in set(scores)}
    # Iterate in reverse to count the number of minutes for each score
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        if scores[i] == max_scores[i]:  # If the score was the highest at that minute
            highest_minutes[scores[i]] += 1
            if i > 0 and max_scores[i] > max_scores[i - 1]:
                break  # Stop if this was the last minute for this score being the highest

    # Process queries and generate output
    output = [highest_minutes.get(query, 0) for query in queries]

    # Write output
    with open('schi.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, output)) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Now, this solution first constructs the `max_scores` list to track the highest score at each minute. Then, it iterates in reverse through the scores, counting the number of minutes each score was the highest until a score is no longer the highest. This should correctly answer the queries and yield the expected output.
