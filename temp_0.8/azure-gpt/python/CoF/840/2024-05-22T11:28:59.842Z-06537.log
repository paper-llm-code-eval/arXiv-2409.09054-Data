Se consideră un șir $A$ format din $N$ elemente naturale nenule. Numim secvență de lungime $K$ a șirului $A$ orice succesiune de elemente consecutive din șir de forma $A_i, A_{i+1}, \dots, A_{i+K-1}$.

O secvență o numim *secvență cool* dacă elementele care o compun sunt distincte și pot fi rearanjate astfel încât să alcătuiască o secvență continuă de numere consecutive.

De exemplu, considerând șirul $A = (3,1,6,8,4,5,6,7,4,3,4)$, atunci secvența $(8,4,5,6,7)$ este o *secvență cool* deoarece conține elemente distincte ce pot fi rearanjate astfel încât să alcătuiască șirul de numere consecutive $4,5,6,7,8$, pe când secvențele $(4,3,4)$, $(6,7,4,3)$ **nu** sunt considerate *secvențe cool*.

# Cerinţă
Fiind dat un şir de $N$ numere naturale nenule se cer următoarele:
1. Pentru o valoare dată $K$ să se verifice dacă secvența $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_K$ este *secvență cool*. Dacă secvența este *cool*, atunci se va afișa cea mai mare valoare ce aparține secvenței. Dacă secvența nu este *cool*, atunci se va afișa numărul elementelor distincte din secvența $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_K$, adică numărul elementelor care apar o singură dată.
2. Lungimea maximă a unei *secvențe cool* și numărul *secvențelor cool* de lungime maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `cool.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $p$. Pentru toate testele de intrare, numărul $p$ poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau valoarea $2$. Pe linia a doua se găsesc, despărțite printr-un spațiu, două numere naturale $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarea linie se găsesc $N$ numere întregi, separate prin câte un spațiu, ce reprezintă elementele şirului.

# Date de ieşire
Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $1$, atunci **se va rezolva numai punctul 1** din cerință. În acest caz, fişierul de ieşire `cool.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural, număr ce reprezintă conform cerinței $1$, maximul secvenței $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_K$, dacă secvența este *secvență cool*, sau numărul elementelor distincte din secvență, dacă aceasta **nu** este *secvență cool*.
\
Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $2$, **se va rezolva numai punctul 2** din cerință. În acest caz, fişierul de ieşire `cool.out` va avea două linii. Prima linie va conține un număr natural nenul ce reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *secvențe cool*, iar următoarea linie un număr natural nenul ce reprezintă numărul de *secvențe cool* care au lungimea maximă.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 5\ 000$
- $2 \leq K \leq 1\ 000$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 1\ 000$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Pentru $30\%$ dintre teste $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerința a doua se acordă $80\%$ din punctaj.

                current_len = len(unique_elements)
                if current_len > max_len:

                elif current_len == max_len:
                    count += 1
    return max_len, count

# Read input data
with open('cool.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process and write output data

    elif p == 2:

        file.write(f'{max_len}\n{count}\n')
```

This code block reads from `cool.in`, processes the information according to the problem statement, and writes the results to `cool.out`. It defines two separate tasks (task1 and task2) to handle the two possible values of `p`. The functions `is_cool_sequence` and `task1` check if the first `K` elements form a cool sequence. The `task2` function finds the maximum length of a cool sequence and the number of such sequences. The code avoids using `input()` and `print()` and uses file operations to read and write data.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results occurs because the `is_cool_sequence` function in the original code only checks if the numbers could be consecutive after reordering, but does not correctly handle sequences with duplicates. The correct behavior for a non-cool sequence is to count the number of unique elements.

To fix this, we need to adjust the `is_cool_sequence` function to correctly handle sequences with duplicates. If there are duplicates, the function should return the number of unique elements in the sequence. We'll also add a helper function to determine if a sequence is cool.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def is_cool_sequence(seq):
    if len(seq) != len(set(seq)):
        return len(set(seq))
    else:
        sorted_seq = sorted(seq)
        for i in range(1, len(sorted_seq)):
            if sorted_seq[i] != sorted_seq[i - 1] + 1:
                return len(set(seq))
        return sorted_seq[-1]

def task1(A, K):
    return is_cool_sequence(A[:K])

# The task2 function remains the same as the original solution since it performs the necessary checks.

# Read input data
with open('cool.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process and write output data
with open('cool.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        result = task1(A, K)
        file.write(f'{result}\n')
    elif p == 2:
        max_len, count = task2(A)
        file.write(f'{max_len}\n{count}\n')
```

This revised solution checks for duplicates and correctly does the unique element count if a sequence isn't cool. The `task2` function is not changed because it was correctly implemented to find the longest cool sequence and the count of such sequences. The fixed `is_cool_sequence` function is now used to determine if a sequence is cool and to return the appropriate result for task 1.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly reports the maximum value of the sequence when it should be reporting the number of unique elements if the sequence is not cool. When a sequence contains duplicates, the function `is_cool_sequence` should not return the maximum value in the sequence but rather the count of unique elements.

Let's re-implement the `is_cool_sequence` function to correctly handle the case where the sequence is not cool. Additionally, we'll ensure that we count the number of distinct elements when duplicates are present:

```python
def is_cool_sequence(seq):
    unique_elements = set(seq)
    if len(seq) == len(unique_elements):  # Check if all elements are unique
        sorted_seq = sorted(unique_elements)
        # Check if the sorted unique elements form a consecutive sequence
        if sorted_seq[-1] - sorted_seq[0] + 1 == len(sorted_seq):
            return sorted_seq[-1]  # Return the max value for a cool sequence
        else:
            return len(unique_elements)  # Return the count of unique elements
    else:
        return len(unique_elements)  # Return the count of unique elements

def task1(A, K):
    return is_cool_sequence(A[:K])

# Read input data
with open('cool.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process and write output data
with open('cool.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        result = task1(A, K)
        file.write(f'{result}\n')
    elif p == 2:
        # We do not modify the task2 function because it is not relevant to the reported problem
        pass  # Placeholder, the task2 function would be here if we were to implement it
```

This implementation of `is_cool_sequence` will now return the correct output for a non-cool sequence by providing the count of unique elements within that sequence. For a cool sequence, it will still return the maximum value as per the problem statement. Keep in mind that `task2` is not implemented in this code block as it was not related to the issue at hand. If needed, `task2` should be implemented using an appropriate algorithm that follows the problem requirements.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's revise the solution to ensure it correctly identifies a cool sequence and handles the duplicates properly.

If a sequence of K elements is a cool sequence, it must:
1. Contain K unique elements.
2. The difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sequence should be K-1.
If these conditions are not met, the output should be the number of unique elements in the sequence.

Let's implement this logic:

```python
def is_cool_sequence(seq):
    unique_elements = set(seq)
    # Check if all elements are unique and if they form a continuous sequence
    if len(unique_elements) == len(seq) and max(unique_elements) - min(unique_elements) == len(seq) - 1:
        return max(seq)
    else:
        return len(unique_elements)

def read_and_solve(p, N, K, A):
    if p == 1:
        return is_cool_sequence(A[:K])
    elif p == 2:
        # The task2 function should be implemented here, if needed for the challenge.
        pass

# Read input data from 'cool.in'.
with open('cool.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data and write the output to 'cool.out'.
result = read_and_solve(p, N, K, A)
with open('cool.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This revised solution should now correctly handle the example provided and output `2`, which is the number of unique elements in the sequence `[6, 4, 5, 7, 5, 4]`, as it is not a cool sequence due to the presence of duplicates.

Let's address the issue once more. The expected output is `2` because the sequence `[6, 4, 5, 7, 5, 4]` is not cool due to duplicates, and we need to return the number of distinct elements, which is `4` (since `6`, `4`, `5`, and `7` are distinct). However, the duplicates `5` and `4` make the sequence not cool, hence the expected output is the number of elements that appear only once within the subsequence of length `K`, which is `2` (`6` and `7` in this case).

So we need to count only those elements that appear exactly once in the first `K` elements of the sequence. Let's implement this logic correctly:

```python
from collections import Counter

def is_cool_sequence(seq):
    # Count occurrences of each element
    element_count = Counter(seq)
    # Get elements that appear exactly once
    single_occurrences = [num for num, count in element_count.items() if count == 1]
    # If all elements are unique and form a continuous sequence, it's cool
    if len(single_occurrences) == len(seq) and max(seq) - min(seq) == len(seq) - 1:
        return max(seq)
    else:
        # If not cool, return the count of elements that appear exactly once
        return len(single_occurrences)

# Read input data from 'cool.in'.
with open('cool.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data and write the output to 'cool.out'.
result = is_cool_sequence(A[:K])
with open('cool.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This new implementation uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count how many times each number appears in the first `K` elements of the sequence. If the conditions for a cool sequence are not met, we count how many elements have a single occurrence within those `K` elements and return that count. This should yield the expected output of `2` for the provided input.

It appears there has been a misunderstanding of the problem requirements for determining a "cool sequence". We are to find the longest subsequence within the array that contains distinct elements that can form a consecutive sequence. 

The expected output suggests that the longest cool sequence has a length of 5, and there are two such sequences within the provided array. We need to correctly implement the logic to find the longest cool sequence and the count of such sequences.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct implementation:

```python
def is_cool_sequence(seq):
    if len(seq) != len(set(seq)):
        return False
    return max(seq) - min(seq) + 1 == len(seq)

def cool_sequence_info(A):
    max_length = 0
    count = 0
    for start in range(len(A)):
        seen = set()
        for end in range(start, len(A)):
            if A[end] in seen:
                break
            seen.add(A[end])
            if is_cool_sequence(seen):
                current_length = len(seen)
                if current_length > max_length:
                    max_length = current_length
                    count = 1
                elif current_length == max_length:
                    count += 1
    return max_length, count

# Read input data from 'cool.in'.
with open('cool.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data and write the output to 'cool.out'.
with open('cool.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        # Check if the first K elements form a cool sequence
        if is_cool_sequence(A[:K]):
            file.write(f'{max(A[:K])}\n')
        else:
            file.write(f'{len(set(A[:K]))}\n')
    elif p == 2:
        # Find the maximum length of a cool sequence and the count of such sequences
        max_length, count = cool_sequence_info(A)
        file.write(f'{max_length}\n{count}\n')
```

This solution uses the `is_cool_sequence` function to check if a given set of numbers can form a cool sequence by ensuring that all elements are unique and can form a consecutive sequence. The `cool_sequence_info` function looks for the longest cool sequences starting from each position in the array. It then writes the required output to 'cool.out' based on whether `p` is `1` or `2`. This implementation should provide the expected output for both tasks.

The mismatch between the expected and found results is due to an error in the logic that checks for a cool sequence. In this case, we are not correctly identifying that the sequence is not cool because it contains duplicates. The output should be the number of distinct elements that appear only once in the sequence.

Let's fix the implementation by rewriting the `is_cool_sequence` function. Instead of returning the maximum value of the sequence when it's cool, we should return the length of the sequence (for task 2). For task 1, if the sequence is not cool, we should return only the count of distinct elements that appear exactly once.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def write_result(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f'{result}\n')

def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return p, N, K, A

# Function to check if a sequence is cool
def is_cool_sequence(seq):
    unique_elements = set(seq)
    if len(seq) == len(unique_elements) and max(seq) - min(seq) == len(seq) - 1:
        return True
    return False

# Function to find the longest cool sequence and its count
def find_cool_sequences(A):
    max_len = 0
    max_count = 0
    for i in range(len(A)):
        unique_elements = set()
        for j in range(i, len(A)):
            if A[j] in unique_elements:
                break
            unique_elements.add(A[j])
            if is_cool_sequence(unique_elements):
                if len(unique_elements) > max_len:
                    max_len = len(unique_elements)
                    max_count = 1
                elif len(unique_elements) == max_len:
                    max_count += 1
    return max_len, max_count

# Function to count the number of distinct elements that appear exactly once
def count_unique_single_occurrences(seq):
    element_count = Counter(seq)
    return sum(1 for count in element_count.values() if count == 1)

# Main logic to solve the problem based on the value of p
p, N, K, A = read_input('cool.in')
if p == 1:
    if is_cool_sequence(A[:K]):
        write_result('cool.out', max(A[:K]))
    else:
        write_result('cool.out', count_unique_single_occurrences(A[:K]))
elif p == 2:
    max_len, max_count = find_cool_sequences(A)
    write_result('cool.out', f'{max_len}\n{max_count}')
```

This solution should now correctly handle both tasks based on the value of `p`. It checks if the first `K` elements form a cool sequence and if not, it counts the number of distinct elements that appear exactly once. For task 2, it finds the longest cool sequence and its count. The result is then written to 'cool.out'.
