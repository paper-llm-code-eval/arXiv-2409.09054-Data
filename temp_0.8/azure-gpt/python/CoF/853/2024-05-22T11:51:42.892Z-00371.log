Discul dur (hard disk) este un dispozitiv utilizat pentru stocarea datelor. Stocarea se face pe o suprafață magnetică dispusă pe platane rotunde metalice. Pe un platan, datele sunt organizate în **piste** și **sectoare**, iar zona aflată la intersecția dintre o pistă și un sector poartă denumirea de **cluster**.

Un cluster poate avea două stări: **liber**, dacă nu conține date, sau **ocupat**, atunci când conține date.

Un platan se numește **defragmentat** dacă toți clusterii ocupați de pe fiecare pistă sunt așezați în ordine consecutivă. Defragmentarea se realizează prin mutarea unor clusteri ocupați și are rolul de a micșora timpul de acces la date. Mutarea unui cluster reprezintă transferul datelor de la un cluster ocupat către un cluster liber de pe aceeași pistă.

~[defrag.png|width=90em|align=center]

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de piste $P$ și de sectoare $S$ al unui platan, numărul și poziția clusterilor ocupați, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. numărul de piste care au toți clusterii liberi;
2. numărul **minim** de mutări de clusteri, pentru fiecare pistă în parte, astfel încât platanul să devină defragmentat.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare `defrag.in` se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.
Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsesc două numere naturale $P$ și $S$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ.
A treia linie conţine un număr natural $C$ reprezentând numărul total de clusteri ocupați de pe platan, iar pe fiecare din următoarele $C$ linii se găsește câte o pereche de valori $p_i$ şi $s_i$, $1 \leq i \leq C$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând pista, respectiv sectorul unde se află fiecare cluster ocupat.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire este `defrag.out`.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de piste care au toți clusterii liberi.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conține pe prima linie $P$ numere naturale notate $M_i$, $1 \leq i \leq P$, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, unde $M_i$ reprezintă numărul minim de mutări de clusteri, dintre cei aflați pe pista $i$, astfel încât pe pista $i$ clusterii ocupați să se găsească într-o ordine consecutivă.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $1 \leq P \leq 100$
- $1 \leq S \leq 360$
- $1 \leq C \leq P \cdot S$
- Pistele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $P$ începând cu pista exterioară.
- Sectoarele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $S$ în sensul acelor de ceasornic începând cu sectorul $1$.
- Dacă o pistă are toți clusterii liberi, atunci valoarea cerută la a doua cerință este $0$.
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 2$.

The expected output suggests that for each track, we need to find the largest contiguous sequence of occupied clusters, and calculate the moves based on that. However, my initial solution incorrectly calculated the distances between occupied clusters and subtracted from the total number of occupied clusters on the track. Instead, we should have found the longest sequence of occupied clusters and subtracted this from the total number of clusters to find the number of moves.

Let's correct the logic for finding the minimum number of moves required to defragment the disk:

1. For each track, sort the occupied sector positions.
2. Find the maximum length of a contiguous sequence of occupied sectors.
3. The minimum number of moves for each track is the total occupied clusters minus the length of the longest contiguous sequence.

Let's rewrite the solution with the corrected logic:

```python
# Open the input file for reading.
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as file_in:
    V = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
    C = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    tracks = {i: [] for i in range(1, P + 1)}
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
        tracks[p].append(s)

# Process the data.
if V == 1:
    # Count the number of tracks with all clusters free.
    free_tracks = sum(1 for occupied in tracks.values() if not occupied)
else:
    # Count the minimum number of moves for each track to defragment.
    moves = [0] * P
    for track in range(1, P + 1):
        if tracks[track]:
            # Sort the sectors and create a sequence including the wrap-around.
            sectors = sorted(tracks[track])
            sectors += [s + S for s in sectors]  # Wrap-around

            # Find the longest contiguous sequence of occupied sectors.
            longest_sequence = max(sectors[i + 1] - sectors[i] for i in range(len(sectors) - 1))

            # Calculate the minimum moves required to defragment the track.
            moves[track - 1] = len(tracks[track]) - longest_sequence + 1

# Open the output file for writing.
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as file_out:
    if V == 1:
        file_out.write(f'{free_tracks}\n')
    else:
        file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

In this corrected solution, we find the length of the longest contiguous sequence of occupied sectors correctly, including the possible wrap-around at the end of the disk track, which might create a contiguous sequence when wrapped to the beginning. Then we calculate the number of moves as the total number of occupied sectors minus the length of this longest sequence plus one (for the free space needed to start defragmentation). This should give us the expected output.

The found output indicates that there are discrepancies in the logic used to calculate the minimum number of moves for defragmenting each track. The logic to determine the longest contiguous sequence of occupied sectors and the calculation of moves are incorrect, which resulted in negative and incorrect values. Let's correct the approach:

1. For each track, sort the occupied sector positions.
2. Compute the number of free sectors between each pair of consecutive occupied sectors, taking into account the wrap-around.
3. Find the position where the sequence starts with maximum free sectors (i.e., the least occupied sequence).
4. Subtract the number of occupied sectors in the least occupied sequence from the total number of occupied sectors in the track to get the minimum moves required for defragmentation.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Open the input file for reading.
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as file_in:
    V = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
    C = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    occupied_clusters = {i: [] for i in range(1, P + 1)}
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
        occupied_clusters[p].append(s)

# Process the data.
if V == 1:
    # Count the number of tracks with all clusters free.
    free_tracks = P - len([track for track in occupied_clusters if occupied_clusters[track]])
else:
    # Count the minimum number of moves for each track to defragment the disk.
    moves = []
    for track in range(1, P + 1):
        if not occupied_clusters[track]:
            # If the track has no occupied clusters, append 0 moves.
            moves.append(0)
            continue
        
        # Sort the occupied sectors.
        sectors = sorted(occupied_clusters[track])
        # Calculate the gaps between consecutive occupied sectors including wrap-around.
        gaps = [(sectors[(i + 1) % len(sectors)] - sectors[i] - 1) % S for i in range(len(sectors))]
        # The index of the largest gap indicates the start of the longest contiguous sequence.
        max_gap_index = gaps.index(max(gaps))
        # The minimum moves are the count of occupied sectors minus the largest contiguous sequence.
        moves.append(C - (len(sectors) - gaps[max_gap_index]))

# Open the output file for writing.
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as file_out:
    if V == 1:
        file_out.write(f'{free_tracks}\n')
    else:
        # Subtract the max gap from the count of occupied sectors in that track to get the moves.
        file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly handle both the counting of free tracks (when V == 1) and the calculation of minimum moves required to defragment each track (when V == 2). It correctly identifies the starting point of the defragmentation process by finding the maximum gap and calculates the minimum moves accordingly.

It appears the previous solutions incorrectly calculated the longest contiguous sequence of occupied sectors and the minimum number of moves. Instead, the correct approach should identify the longest sequence of sectors that contain the maximum number of occupied sectors when wrapped around the track, as this sequence would require the fewest moves to defragment.

Let's rework the solution using the correct logic:

1. For each track with occupied clusters, sort the sector positions.
2. Create a list that represents the sequence of sectors as if the track were a continuous loop (doubling the list of sectors).
3. Slide a window of size equal to the number of occupied sectors over this list, finding the window with the most occupied sectors. The number of free sectors in this window is the minimum number of moves needed.
4. Repeat this for each track and collect the results.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Open the input file for reading.
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as file_in:
    V = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
    C = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    occupied_clusters = {i: [] for i in range(1, P + 1)}
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
        occupied_clusters[p].append(s)

# Initialize the output variable.
output = []

# Process the data.
if V == 1:
    # Count the number of tracks with all clusters free.
    free_tracks_count = sum(1 for track in occupied_clusters if not occupied_clusters[track])
    output.append(free_tracks_count)
else:
    # Count the minimum number of moves for each track to defragment the disk.
    for track in range(1, P + 1):
        if not occupied_clusters[track]:
            # If the track has no occupied clusters, the number of moves is 0.
            output.append(0)
            continue

        # Sort the occupied sectors and create an extended loop list.
        occupied = sorted(occupied_clusters[track])
        extended_occupied = occupied + [s + S for s in occupied]

        # Find the window with the maximum number of occupied sectors.
        max_occupied_in_window = max(
            sum(extended_occupied[i] < extended_occupied[j] + S for i in range(j))
            for j in range(len(occupied))
        )

        # Minimum moves is the difference between total occupied and max occupied in any window.
        moves = len(occupied) - max_occupied_in_window
        output.append(moves)

# Open the output file for writing.
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, output)) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution should now properly compute the minimum number of moves for each track to be defragmented by identifying the sequence that already has the most occupied sectors and subtracting this count from the total number of occupied sectors in that track.

The output still differs from the expected result because the previous solution did not correctly find the window with the most occupied sectors. It appears that there was a logical error in the calculation of `max_occupied_in_window`.

Let's fix the logic to find the longest contiguous sequence of occupied clusters for each track:

1. Extend the list of occupied sectors by adding `S` to each sector to handle wrap-around.
2. Sort the extended list of occupied sectors.
3. Slide a window of size `S` (the total number of sectors on the track) over the extended list.
4. For each window, count the number of occupied sectors that would need to be moved if the first sector of the window was the start of the defragmented sequence.
5. The minimum number of moves for a track is the smallest count obtained from all windows.

Here's the revised code with the corrected logic:

```python
# Open the input file for reading.
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as file_in:
    V, P, S = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    C = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    clusters = {i: [] for i in range(1, P + 1)}
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())
        clusters[p].append(s)

# Process the data and calculate the output.
output = []
if V == 1:
    # Count the number of tracks with all clusters free.
    free_tracks_count = sum(1 for track in clusters if not clusters[track])
    output.append(free_tracks_count)
else:
    # Count the minimum number of moves for each track to defragment the disk.
    for track in range(1, P + 1):
        if not clusters[track]:
            # If the track has no occupied clusters, the number of moves is 0.
            output.append(0)
            continue
        
        # Sort the occupied sectors and create an extended list to handle wrap-around.
        occupied = sorted(clusters[track])
        extended_occupied = occupied + [s + S for s in occupied]

        # Initialize the minimum moves to the total number of occupied clusters.
        min_moves = len(occupied)
        for i in range(len(occupied)):
            # Count the occupied sectors in the current window.
            window_start = extended_occupied[i]
            window_end = window_start + S
            occupied_in_window = sum(window_start <= pos < window_end for pos in extended_occupied)
            # Update the minimum moves if the current window has more occupied sectors.
            moves = len(occupied) - occupied_in_window
            if moves < min_moves:
                min_moves = moves
        
        output.append(min_moves)

# Open the output file for writing.
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, output)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly compute the minimum number of moves for defragmenting each track by analyzing possible windows where defragmentation could start, and finding the scenario with the least number of moves needed.

The error occurred because the program tried to unpack three values from a line that only contains one value. This happened because I mistakenly combined the reading of the `V` value with the line that contains `P` and `S`. I need to separate the reading of `V` from the reading of `P` and `S`.

Let's fix this by properly reading `V` from the first line and then reading `P` and `S` from the second line. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Open the input file for reading.
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as file_in:
    V = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    C = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    clusters = {i: [] for i in range(1, P + 1)}
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
        clusters[p].append(s)

# Process the data and calculate the output.
output = []
if V == 1:
    # Count the number of tracks with all clusters free.
    free_tracks_count = sum(1 for track in clusters if not clusters[track])
    output.append(free_tracks_count)
else:
    # Count the minimum number of moves for each track to defragment the disk.
    for track in range(1, P + 1):
        if not clusters[track]:
            output.append(0)
            continue

        # Sort the occupied sectors and extend the list to handle the wrap-around case.
        occupied_sectors = sorted(clusters[track])
        extended_sectors = occupied_sectors + [sector + S for sector in occupied_sectors]

        # Initialize minimum moves to the total number of occupied clusters.
        min_moves = len(occupied_sectors)
        for i in range(len(occupied_sectors)):
            # Count the occupied sectors in the current window.
            window_start = extended_sectors[i]
            window_end = window_start + S
            occupied_in_window = sum(window_start <= x < window_end for x in extended_sectors)
            # Calculate moves needed.
            moves = len(occupied_sectors) - occupied_in_window
            # Update minimum moves if necessary.
            min_moves = min(min_moves, moves)
        
        output.append(min_moves)

# Open the output file for writing.
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as file_out:
    if V == 1:
        file_out.write(f'{output[0]}\n')
    else:
        file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, output)) + '\n')
```

This solution corrects the issue of reading the input file by separately reading `V` and then `P` and `S`. It then processes the cluster information to either count the free tracks or calculate the minimum number of moves needed to defragment each track. Finally, it writes the correct results to `defrag.out`.

The found output indicates that the program incorrectly calculated the number of moves for all tracks as zero, which means it didn't correctly identify the occupied clusters or there's a logical error in the calculation of minimum moves. Let's fix the approach for calculating the minimum number of moves:

1. For each track, sort the sector positions.
2. To handle the wrap-around, append the list with each sector position plus the total number of sectors (S).
3. Find the longest sequence of sectors that contains the maximum number of already adjacent occupied sectors (the smallest sequence to move).
4. Compute the number of moves as the total number of occupied sectors minus the number of occupied sectors in the longest sequence.

Here is the corrected solution with a proper calculation of moves for each track:

```python
# Open the input file for reading.
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as file_in:
    V = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    C = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    # Create a dictionary to hold the occupied sectors for each track.
    tracks = {i: [] for i in range(1, P + 1)}
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
        tracks[p].append(s)

# Initialize an empty list to store the minimum number of moves for each track.
moves = [0] * P

# Process for V == 2, as we want to compute the minimum number of moves.
if V == 2:
    for track in range(1, P + 1):
        occupied = sorted(tracks[track])
        if not occupied:
            continue  # No moves needed if there are no occupied sectors.

        # Create an extended list to simulate a circular track.
        occupied += [x + S for x in occupied]

        # Find the longest sequence of occupied sectors in the circular list.
        max_sequence = 0
        for i in range(len(occupied) // 2):
            j = i
            while j < len(occupied) // 2 + i and occupied[j] - occupied[i] == j - i:
                j += 1
            max_sequence = max(max_sequence, j - i)

        # Calculate the number of moves to defragment the track.
        moves[track - 1] = len(tracks[track]) - max_sequence

# Write the output to 'defrag.out'.
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as file_out:
    if V == 1:
        file_out.write(f"{P - sum(1 for t in tracks if tracks[t])}\n")
    else:
        file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

This revised code should now correctly calculate the number of occupied sectors and the minimum number of moves required to defragment each track. It first sorts the occupied sectors, handles the wrap-around by duplicating the sector list, and finds the longest continuous sequence of occupied sectors. The number of moves for each track is then the total number of occupied sectors minus the length of this sequence.
