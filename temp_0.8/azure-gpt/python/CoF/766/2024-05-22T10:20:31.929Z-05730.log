Campania electorală s-a terminat de mult, dar zidul din parcul central al orașului în care au fost puse afișele este încă într-o formă dezolantă. Ploile și vântul au acționat și au urâțit și mai mult această zonă pe care altă dată erau afișe frumos colorate. Primăria a decis să se ocupe de această problemă. A format o comisie și a decis realizarea unor panouri reclamă care să ascundă porțiunile deteriorate.

Deoarece fondurile sunt mici s-a decis să fie alocate doar un anumit număr de panouri publicitare care trebuie să ocupe o suprafață cât mai mică posibil. Comisia a primit datele din teren sub forma: lungime zid, câte unități sunt ocupate cu afișe ce trebuie acoperite și care este numărul de panouri pe care le poate folosi. De asemenea se primesc ca date și care sunt unitățile de zid ocupate cu afișe deja deteriorate.

# Cerință

Fiind date lungimea zidului, câte unități sunt deteriorate, care este numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite și care sunt unitățile de zid deteriorate, se cere să se determine lungimea minimă totală a panourilor care sunt folosite pentru a acoperi zona și câte panouri se folosesc. Lungimea minimă o definim ca numărul total de unități de zid acoperite astfel încât să fie mascate zonele problemă. Pentru acoperirea unităților de zid deteriorate, nu este neapărat necesar să se folosească toate panourile. Numărul de panouri folosite fiind limitat există posibilitatea să fie acoperite și zone din zid care sunt curate.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `afise.in` conține pe prima linie $3$ valori separate prin câte un spațiu $L \ n \ k$, cu semnificația: $L$ lungimea totală a zidului, $n$ numărul de unități ce urmează a fi acoperite și $k$ numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite. Pe a doua linie separate prin câte un spațiu sunt $n$ valori $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, unde xi reprezintă unitatea din zid care este acoperită de un afiș vechi. Valorile $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, apar într-o ordine aleatoare.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `afise.out` conține o singură linie cu două valoari ce reprezintă lungimea minimă totală folosită și numărul de panouri folosite astfel încât toate zonele deteriorate să fie acoperite.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < L \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 < n \leq L$;
* $0 < k \leq L / 2$;

Upon re-evaluating the logic, it seems the algorithm incorrectly calculates the total length and the number of panels used. The problem lies in the merging of gaps. Instead of merging the smallest gaps first, it's more efficient to merge the largest gaps when we are limited by the number of panels we can use. This ensures that we cover the maximum possible distance with each panel, thus minimizing the total length.

Here's the fixed and improved solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('afise.in', 'r') as file:
    L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Sort the damaged unit positions
damaged_units.sort()

# Initialize gaps as the distance between consecutive damaged units
gaps = [damaged_units[i] - damaged_units[i-1] - 1 for i in range(1, n)]
# Sort gaps to find the largest gaps first, which we will try to not cover
gaps.sort(reverse=True)

# We can leave k - 1 largest gaps uncovered (since k panels can leave k - 1 gaps between them)
# Start with total length covering all damaged units (including gaps)
total_length = damaged_units[-1] - damaged_units[0] + 1

# Reduce the total length by the length of each gap we decide not to cover
for i in range(min(k - 1, len(gaps))):
    total_length -= gaps[i]

# The number of panels used is the minimum of available panels or the number of gaps between damaged units plus one
used_panels = min(k, n if n > 1 else 1)

# Write output to file
with open('afise.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the minimized total length and the number of used panels
    file.write(f'{total_length} {used_panels}\n')
```

With this corrected solution, the algorithm now:

1. Sorts the damaged units.
2. Calculates the gaps between them.
3. Sorts these gaps in descending order.
4. Subtracts the largest gaps from the total length, allowing for a smaller number of panels to be used.
5. Writes out the minimized total length and the actual number of used panels to the output file.

The reported output differs from the expected one because the algorithm incorrectly calculates the number of panels used. It's taking the minimum of the available panels or the number of gaps plus one. However, in this scenario where we have more panels available than required, we should only use as many panels as necessary to cover the damaged units without any gaps between them. The expected output shows that we can use fewer panels than the maximum allowed if it results in a lower total length covered.

To correct this, we must adjust the logic for determining the number of panels used. We should use exactly as many panels as needed to cover the damaged areas contiguously, which is equivalent to the number of continuous damaged segments on the wall after leaving out the largest gaps possible.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('afise.in', 'r') as file:
    L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Sort the damaged unit positions
damaged_units.sort()

# Initialize gaps as the distance between consecutive damaged units
gaps = [damaged_units[i] - damaged_units[i-1] - 1 for i in range(1, n)]
# Sort gaps to find the largest gaps first, which we will try to not cover
gaps.sort(reverse=True)

# We can leave k - 1 largest gaps uncovered (since k panels can leave k - 1 gaps between them)
# Start with total length covering all damaged units (including gaps)
total_length = damaged_units[-1] - damaged_units[0] + 1

# Calculate the total number of segments formed by damaged units and gaps
total_segments = 1  # Always at least one segment

# Reduce the total length by the length of each gap we decide not to cover
# and count how many segments are created after excluding gaps
for i in range(min(k - 1, len(gaps))):
    total_length -= gaps[i]
    total_segments += 1

# The number of panels used should be equal to the number of segments
used_panels = total_segments

# Write output to file
with open('afise.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the minimized total length and the correct number of used panels
    file.write(f'{total_length} {used_panels}\n')
```

Now, the algorithm considers the number of segments created after excluding the largest gaps that we can afford to leave uncovered, which correctly corresponds to the number of panels needed to cover the damaged units contiguously. This should provide the expected output.

The results differ because the algorithm does not accurately determine the minimum number of panels needed to cover the damaged units. The previous solution incorrectly assumes that the number of panels equals the number of segments created after excluding gaps between damaged units.

The issue lies in the fact that if we have more panels than necessary, we don't need to use them all. We should use only as many as needed to cover the damaged units in the most efficient way.

To fix the solution, we must find the minimum number of panels required to cover all damaged units. We should:

1. Sort the damaged units.
2. Calculate the gaps between them.
3. Sort these gaps in descending order (to maximize the area that we can leave uncovered).
4. Subtract the largest gaps from the total length if we have extra panels to do so.
5. Determine the actual number of panels needed based on the remaining gaps after subtracting the unused panels.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('afise.in', 'r') as file:
    L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Sort the damaged unit positions
damaged_units.sort()

# Initialize gaps as the distances between consecutive damaged units
gaps = [damaged_units[i] - damaged_units[i - 1] - 1 for i in range(1, n)]
# Sort gaps to find the largest gaps, which we might choose to not cover
gaps.sort(reverse=True)

# Calculate the initial total length assuming we cover all damaged units
total_length = damaged_units[-1] - damaged_units[0] + 1

# We can leave up to k - 1 largest gaps uncovered
# Reduce the total length by these gaps if we have enough panels
for i in range(min(k - 1, len(gaps))):
    total_length -= gaps[i]

# The number of used panels is determined by the number of continuous segments we need to cover.
# Each time we skip a gap, we form a new segment, so we start with 1 segment.
used_panels = 1

# If we have leftover panels after covering the largest gaps, we can create more segments
# by not covering the next largest gaps.
for i in range(min(k - 1, len(gaps))):
    if gaps[i] > 0:
        used_panels += 1

# Write output to file
with open('afise.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_length} {used_panels}\n')
```

This solution should correctly determine both the minimum total length required to cover all damaged units and the actual number of panels used, which may be less than the maximum number available if doing so results in a smaller coverage length.
