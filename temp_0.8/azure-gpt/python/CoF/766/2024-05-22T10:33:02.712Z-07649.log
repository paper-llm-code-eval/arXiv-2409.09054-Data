Campania electorală s-a terminat de mult, dar zidul din parcul central al orașului în care au fost puse afișele este încă într-o formă dezolantă. Ploile și vântul au acționat și au urâțit și mai mult această zonă pe care altă dată erau afișe frumos colorate. Primăria a decis să se ocupe de această problemă. A format o comisie și a decis realizarea unor panouri reclamă care să ascundă porțiunile deteriorate.

Deoarece fondurile sunt mici s-a decis să fie alocate doar un anumit număr de panouri publicitare care trebuie să ocupe o suprafață cât mai mică posibil. Comisia a primit datele din teren sub forma: lungime zid, câte unități sunt ocupate cu afișe ce trebuie acoperite și care este numărul de panouri pe care le poate folosi. De asemenea se primesc ca date și care sunt unitățile de zid ocupate cu afișe deja deteriorate.

# Cerință

Fiind date lungimea zidului, câte unități sunt deteriorate, care este numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite și care sunt unitățile de zid deteriorate, se cere să se determine lungimea minimă totală a panourilor care sunt folosite pentru a acoperi zona și câte panouri se folosesc. Lungimea minimă o definim ca numărul total de unități de zid acoperite astfel încât să fie mascate zonele problemă. Pentru acoperirea unităților de zid deteriorate, nu este neapărat necesar să se folosească toate panourile. Numărul de panouri folosite fiind limitat există posibilitatea să fie acoperite și zone din zid care sunt curate.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `afise.in` conține pe prima linie $3$ valori separate prin câte un spațiu $L \ n \ k$, cu semnificația: $L$ lungimea totală a zidului, $n$ numărul de unități ce urmează a fi acoperite și $k$ numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite. Pe a doua linie separate prin câte un spațiu sunt $n$ valori $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, unde xi reprezintă unitatea din zid care este acoperită de un afiș vechi. Valorile $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, apar într-o ordine aleatoare.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `afise.out` conține o singură linie cu două valoari ce reprezintă lungimea minimă totală folosită și numărul de panouri folosite astfel încât toate zonele deteriorate să fie acoperite.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < L \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 < n \leq L$;
* $0 < k \leq L / 2$;

The issue arises from the fact that the provided algorithm does not correctly calculate the total length of panels needed to cover the damaged portions of the wall. It incorrectly sums up the number of damaged units without considering that panels can cover multiple contiguous damaged units in a single span.

We need to adjust the algorithm to account for the lengths of continuous stretches of damaged units that can be covered by a single panel, and then use the remaining panels to cover as much of the longest gaps between these stretches as possible, thereby minimizing the total length of the panels.

I will correct the algorithm and rewrite the solution:

```python
def cover_posters(L, n, k, damaged_units):
    damaged_units.sort()
    intervals = [(damaged_units[i], damaged_units[i]) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Merging continuous damaged units into intervals
    merged_intervals = []
    for start, end in intervals:
        if not merged_intervals or merged_intervals[-1][1] < start - 1:
            merged_intervals.append((start, end))
        else:
            merged_intervals[-1] = (merged_intervals[-1][0], end)
    
    # If the number of panels is greater than or equal to the number of intervals,
    # then we simply use one panel for each interval.
    if k >= len(merged_intervals):
        panels_length = sum(end - start + 1 for start, end in merged_intervals)
        return panels_length, len(merged_intervals)

    # Otherwise, we greedily choose the largest gaps to cover with the remaining k-1 panels.
    gaps = [merged_intervals[i+1][0] - merged_intervals[i][1] - 1 for i in range(len(merged_intervals) - 1)]
    gaps.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Deduct the largest k-1 gaps from the total length
    panels_length = L - sum(gaps[:k-1])
    return panels_length, k

# Now we read the input file, run the function, and write to the output file.
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

min_length, used_panels = cover_posters(L, n, k, damaged_units)

with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")
```

The main changes here include creating intervals for contiguous damaged units and ensuring we use a panel for each interval if we have enough panels. If not, we find the largest gaps between intervals and cover those with the remaining panels, prioritizing the coverage of larger gaps. This approach should yield the minimum total length of panels used and the number of panels used.

The discrepancies between the expected and found results occur due to a mistake in the algorithm that calculates the total length of panels used. The error lies in the calculation of the `panels_length` in the `cover_posters` function. Instead of subtracting the largest gaps between the intervals from the total wall length, the algorithm should be calculating the length of panels needed to cover just the damaged units and the gaps between them if using fewer panels than the number of intervals.

Let's fix the algorithm and rewrite the solution:

```python
def calculate_min_panel_length(damaged_units, k):
    # Sort the damaged unit positions.
    damaged_units.sort()

    # Calculate the intervals between damaged units.
    intervals = []
    for i in range(len(damaged_units) - 1):
        intervals.append(damaged_units[i+1] - damaged_units[i] - 1)
    intervals.sort()

    # Determine the number of gaps to cover using k-1 panels.
    gaps_to_cover = len(damaged_units) - k
    min_length = damaged_units[-1] - damaged_units[0] + 1  # Length to cover all damages continuously.

    # Reduce the total length by the largest gaps if we have fewer panels than damaged intervals.
    for i in range(gaps_to_cover):
        min_length += intervals[i]

    return min_length

# Read input file, process data, and write output file.
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# If we have more panels than damaged units, we can cover each separately.
if k >= n:
    min_length = n
    used_panels = n
else:
    min_length = calculate_min_panel_length(damaged_units, k)
    used_panels = k  # We use all available panels.

with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, we sort the damaged units and calculate the intervals between them. We find out how many gaps we need to cover given the number of panels we have. If k is greater or equal to n, then each damaged unit can be covered with an individual panel. Otherwise, we calculate the minimum length of panels needed by covering the damaged units and the smallest gaps, ensuring we use all k panels available. This should provide the correct output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to an error in the logic used to calculate the minimum length of the panels. The correct approach is to first merge the damaged units into intervals that can be covered by a single panel, then choose the best gaps to merge with the available panels to minimize the total length.

In the previous solution, we incorrectly added gaps without properly considering which gaps to cover with the available panels. The correct approach is to cover the gaps between the intervals that result in the shortest total panel length.

Let's fix the algorithm with the right approach:

```python
def cover_posters(damaged_units, k):
    # Sort the damaged units to form continuous intervals.
    damaged_units.sort()
    intervals = [(damaged_units[0], damaged_units[0])]
    for unit in damaged_units[1:]:
        if unit - intervals[-1][1] > 1:
            intervals.append((unit, unit))
        else:
            intervals[-1] = (intervals[-1][0], unit)
    
    # Calculate the lengths of the gaps between intervals.
    gaps = [intervals[i+1][0] - intervals[i][1] - 1 for i in range(len(intervals) - 1)]
    
    # Sort gaps in ascending order.
    gaps.sort()
    
    # Use available panels to cover the largest gaps.
    while k < len(intervals) and gaps:
        gaps.pop()
        k += 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum length of the panels used.
    min_length = sum(interval[1] - interval[0] + 1 for interval in intervals) + sum(gaps)
    
    return min_length, len(intervals) - len(gaps)

# Read input file, process data, and write output file.
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

min_length, used_panels = cover_posters(damaged_units, k)

with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, we first sort the damaged units, then merge them into continuous intervals. We calculate the gaps between these intervals and sort them to prioritize covering the largest gaps with the available panels. We then calculate the minimum length of the panels by adding the length of all intervals and uncovered gaps, ensuring we use the maximum number of panels available up to k. This should yield the correct output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to a flaw in the algorithm's logic. It should calculate the minimum length of the panels using the maximum number of panels available, up to `k`, while fully covering all the damaged units.

The algorithm should work as follows:
1. Sort the damaged units.
2. Calculate the intervals that need to be covered by the panels.
3. Sort these intervals based on their lengths, as we want to place the panels on the longest intervals first.
4. Place panels on the longest intervals until we run out of panels or all intervals are covered.
5. If panels remain, we cover individual damaged units, starting from the farthest ones from each interval, to minimize the total length of panels used.

Let's fix the solution with the correct logic:

```python
def cover_posters(damaged_units, k):
    # Sort the damaged units.
    damaged_units.sort()
    
    # Calculate the intervals between damaged units.
    intervals = [(damaged_units[0], damaged_units[0])]
    for unit in damaged_units[1:]:
        if unit == intervals[-1][1] + 1:
            intervals[-1] = (intervals[-1][0], unit)
        else:
            intervals.append((unit, unit))

    # Sort the intervals by their sizes (descending).
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize variables.
    total_covered_length = 0
    panels_used = 0
    
    # Place panels on the longest intervals first.
    for start, end in intervals:
        if panels_used < k:
            total_covered_length += (end - start + 1)
            panels_used += 1
        else:
            break
    
    # If we have more panels than intervals, cover the remaining damaged units.
    if panels_used < k:
        remaining_units = [unit for start, end in intervals for unit in range(start, end + 1)]
        for i in range(panels_used, k):
            if remaining_units:
                remaining_units.sort(reverse=True)
                total_covered_length += 1
                remaining_units.pop(0)
            else:
                break
        panels_used = min(k, panels_used + len(remaining_units))

    return total_covered_length, panels_used

# Read input file, process data, and write output file.
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

min_length, used_panels = cover_posters(damaged_units, k)

with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")
```

In this fixed solution, we sort the damaged units and group them into intervals. We then sort the intervals by size and use the panels on the largest intervals first. If panels remain, we cover individual damaged units. This should provide the correct output based on the constraints and information given in the challenge prompt.

We need to fix the algorithm to correctly handle the constraints and to ensure that we are covering the damaged units with the minimum length of panels while utilizing up to `k` panels.

We should follow these steps:

1. Sort the damaged units to determine contiguous intervals that need to be covered.
2. Calculate the lengths of these intervals.
3. Sort the intervals by their starting positions to determine the actual lengths of panels needed to cover them.
4. Determine the optimal placement of panels to cover the intervals with the minimum total length.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def cover_posters(damaged_units, k):
    # Sort the damaged units to determine contiguous intervals that need to be covered.
    damaged_units.sort()
    
    # Initialize the list of intervals.
    intervals = [[damaged_units[0], damaged_units[0]]]

    # Group damaged units into intervals.
    for unit in damaged_units[1:]:
        if unit == intervals[-1][1] + 1:  # If contiguous, extend the current interval.
            intervals[-1][1] = unit
        else:  # Otherwise, start a new interval.
            intervals.append([unit, unit])
    
    # If the number of panels is greater than the number of intervals,
    # use one panel per interval.
    if k >= len(intervals):
        return sum(end - start + 1 for start, end in intervals), len(intervals)

    # Sort intervals by their starting positions.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Use the panels to cover as many of the largest intervals as possible.
    panel_lengths = []
    for start, end in intervals:
        panel_lengths.append(end - start + 1)
    
    # Sort panel lengths in descending order and take the k largest.
    panel_lengths.sort(reverse=True)
    min_length = sum(panel_lengths[:k])

    # Sometimes it's better to cover two small intervals with one panel than to cover a large interval.
    # We check if we can reduce the length by merging two intervals.
    for i in range(k - 1, len(intervals)):
        if i + 1 < len(intervals) and intervals[i][1] + 1 >= intervals[i + 1][0]:
            merge_length = intervals[i + 1][1] - intervals[i][0] + 1
            if merge_length <= panel_lengths[k - 1] + panel_lengths[i]:
                min_length -= panel_lengths[k - 1]
                min_length += merge_length
                panel_lengths[k - 1] = merge_length
                panel_lengths[i] = 0
                intervals[i + 1][0] = intervals[i][0]
                
    return min_length, k

# Read input file, process data, and write output file.
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

min_length, used_panels = cover_posters(damaged_units, k)

with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")
```

Now, the corrected solution groups the damaged units into intervals, then it checks if the number of panels is sufficient to cover each interval with a separate panel. If not, the algorithm sorts the intervals by size, and covers as many of the largest intervals as possible with the available panels. It also checks for the possibility of merging two adjacent intervals into a single panel if it reduces the total length of panels used. This should yield the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is because the algorithm is not correctly calculating the minimal total length of panels needed to cover the damaged units. The correct approach should include creating intervals of adjacent damaged units and then finding an optimal set of these intervals that can be covered by the available panels while ensuring all damaged units are covered and the total length of panels used is minimized.

To solve this problem, we should follow these steps:

1. Sort the damaged units to create a list of intervals of adjacent damaged units.
2. Calculate the lengths of these intervals.
3. Determine which intervals can be merged based on the number of available panels.
4. Calculate the minimum total length of panels that cover all the damaged units.

In the corrected algorithm, we will merge the smallest intervals first to minimize the panel length used.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
def cover_posters(damaged_units, k):
    # Sort the damaged units.
    damaged_units.sort()

    # Initialize intervals as a list of tuples, with each tuple being (start, end, length).
    intervals = []
    start = end = damaged_units[0]
    for unit in damaged_units[1:]:
        if unit == end + 1:
            end = unit  # Extend the current interval.
        else:
            intervals.append((start, end, end - start + 1))  # Close the current interval.
            start = end = unit  # Start a new interval.
    intervals.append((start, end, end - start + 1))  # Add the last interval.

    # If we have more panels than intervals, we can cover each individually.
    if k >= len(intervals):
        return sum(length for _, _, length in intervals), len(intervals)

    # Otherwise, we need to merge some intervals. We start by merging the smallest intervals.
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by interval length.
    while len(intervals) > k:
        # Merge the two smallest intervals.
        i1 = intervals.pop(0)
        i2 = intervals.pop(0)
        new_interval = (min(i1[0], i2[0]), max(i1[1], i2[1]),
                        max(i1[1], i2[1]) - min(i1[0], i2[0]) + 1)
        intervals.append(new_interval)
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort again after merging.

    # Calculate the total length of panels used.
    total_length = sum(length for _, _, length in intervals)

    return total_length, k

# Read input file, process data, and write output file.
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

min_length, used_panels = cover_posters(damaged_units, k)

with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the minimal total length of panels needed to cover the damaged units by considering the length of each interval and merging the smallest intervals first to ensure that all damaged units are covered with the minimal number of panels up to `k`. This should yield the expected output.
