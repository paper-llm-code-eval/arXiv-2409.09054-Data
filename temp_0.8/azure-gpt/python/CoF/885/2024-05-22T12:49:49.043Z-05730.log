Se consideră un tablou cu N linii și N coloane (numerotate de la $1$ la $N$) care conține valoarea $1$ în fiecare dintre cele $N \ cdot N$ celule. Valorile din tablou pot fi modificate prin aplicarea a două operații codificate astfel:

* $L \ nr$, prin care se schimbă simultan toate semnele numerelor din linia cu numărul $nr$.
* $C \ nr$, prin care se schimbă simultan toate semnele numerelor din coloana cu numărul $nr$.

# Cerință
1. Dându-se o succesiune de $K$ operații ($L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$) asupra liniilor/coloanelor tabloului inițial (în care toate celulele conțin valoarea $1$) să se determine numărul valorilor pozitive din tablou la finalul executării celor $K$ operații.
2. Să se determine numărul minim de operații $L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$, care, aplicate tabloului inițial, îl modifică astfel încât tabloul obținut să conțină exact $Z$ valori negative.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `tablou.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $p = 1$ sau $p = 2$, reprezentând numărul cerinței ce trebuie rezolvată.

* Dacă $p = 1$ atunci linia a doua a fișierului de intrare conține numerele $N$ și $K$, separate printr-un spațiu, iar următoarele $K$ linii conțin fiecare câte o literă mare ($L$ sau $C$) și un număr $nr$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând codificarea uneia dintre cele două operații ($L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$).
* Dacă $p = 2$ atunci linia a doua a fișierului de intrare conține numerele $N$ și $Z$, separate printr-un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

* Dacă $p = 1$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `tablou.out` conține pe prima linie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul valorilor pozitive din tabloul obținut la finalul executării celor $K$ operații asupra tabloului inițial (răspunsul la cerința $1$).
* Dacă $p = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `tablou.out` conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul minim de operații $L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$, care, aplicate tabloului inițial, îl modifică astfel încât tabloul obținut să conțină exact $Z$ valori negative (răspunsul la cerința $2$). Dacă prin aplicarea de operații $L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$ tabloului inițial nu se poate obține un tablou cu $Z$ valori negative, atunci, fișierul va conține pe prima linie valoarea $0$ (zero).

# Restricții și precizări

* $N, K, Z$ și $nr$ sunt numere naturale
* $3 \leq N \leq 20 \ 000$; $1 \leq K \leq 43 \ 000$; $1 \leq Z \leq N \cdot N$; $1 \leq nr \leq N$;
* Prin schimbare de semn, valoarea $-1$ se transformă în $1$ și valoarea $1$ se transformă în $-1$
* Se acordă $10$ puncte din oficiu și câte $45$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a fiecărei cerințe.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here is an efficient Python solution for the challenge, which reads from `tablou.in` and writes to `tablou.out`:

```python
def solve_case_1(n, operations):
    positive_rows = n
    positive_cols = n
    row_changes = [0] * (n + 1)
    col_changes = [0] * (n + 1)

    for ope, idx in operations:
        if ope == 'L':
            row_changes[idx] ^= 1
            positive_rows += 1 if row_changes[idx] == 0 else -1
        else:
            col_changes[idx] ^= 1
            positive_cols += 1 if col_changes[idx] == 0 else -1

    positive_cells = (n - positive_rows) * positive_cols + positive_rows * (n - positive_cols)
    return positive_cells

def solve_case_2(n, z):
    if z % n == 0 or (n*n - z) % n == 0:
        return 1
    if z < n or n*n - z < n:
        return 0
    return 2

with open('tablou.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    n, second_param = map(int, file.readline().split())
    
    if p == 1:
        operations = [(line.split()[0], int(line.split()[1])) for line in file]
        result = solve_case_1(n, operations)
    else:
        result = solve_case_2(n, second_param)

with open('tablou.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

For the `solve_case_1` function, I keep track of changes to rows and columns separately using two arrays `row_changes` and `col_changes`. I update the counts of positive rows and columns directly while processing each operation, avoiding the need to maintain or modify the entire N x N matrix, which would be inefficient.

For the `solve_case_2` function, after analyzing the problem, we can conclude that if Z is a multiple of N or if the complement of Z (N*N - Z) is a multiple of N, only one operation is needed. Otherwise, if Z is less than N, it's not possible to achieve exactly Z negative values. In all other cases, exactly 2 operations are required. This analysis is possible because each cell change from positive to negative or vice versa affects exactly one row and one column, and hence changing one row or column will affect N cells.

This solution should be very quick for large N and K values due to its O(K) and O(1) complexity for case 1 and case 2, respectively.

Upon reviewing the solution and the output provided, it seems there was a bug in the `solve_case_1` function. The way the number of positive cells is calculated is incorrect. We should count the positive cells in rows and columns that are affected by the operations correctly.

The logic in the original solution for calculating positive cells after operations is also incorrect. For every row operation, we should invert the sign of the entire row, and for every column operation, we should invert the sign of the entire column. A cell will be positive if it has been affected an even number of times (initially it's positive, one operation makes it negative, two operations make it positive again).

We can fix this by using two sets to track the unique row and column operations and then calculate the number of positive cells by considering the parity of the total number of operations affecting each cell.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
def solve_case_1(n, operations):
    # Sets to track unique operations on rows and columns
    row_flips = set()
    col_flips = set()

    for op, idx in operations:
        if op == 'L':
            if idx in row_flips:
                row_flips.remove(idx)
            else:
                row_flips.add(idx)
        elif op == 'C':
            if idx in col_flips:
                col_flips.remove(idx)
            else:
                col_flips.add(idx)
    
    # Calculate number of positive cells after all operations
    num_positive_rows = n - len(row_flips)
    num_positive_cols = n - len(col_flips)
    num_negative_rows = len(row_flips)
    num_negative_cols = len(col_flips)

    # Cells that are positive are those which are in positive rows and columns
    # or those which are in negative rows and columns (flipped twice)
    positive_cells = num_positive_rows * num_positive_cols + num_negative_rows * num_negative_cols
    return positive_cells

with open('tablou.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    n, second_param = map(int, file.readline().split())
    
    if p == 1:
        operations = [(line.split()[0], int(line.split()[1])) for line in file]
        result = solve_case_1(n, operations)
    else:
        # The solve_case_2 function remains the same as it is not related to the bug
        result = solve_case_2(n, second_param)

with open('tablou.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now provide the correct output for the given problem. We're using sets to track unique operations, ensuring that we're not double-counting any operations on the same row or column. The correct number of positive cells is then calculated based on the number of operations that have been performed.

The exit code 1 and the error message indicate that there is a `NameError` in our code, and the function `solve_case_2` is not defined. It looks like the definition of `solve_case_2` function was not included in the code block provided.

To fix the program, we need to properly define the `solve_case_2` function:

```python
def solve_case_2(n, z):
    # If we can fill a whole number of rows or columns with negative values, only one operation is needed.
    if z % n == 0 or (n * n - z) % n == 0:
        return 1
    return 2  # In all other cases, we can achieve Z negatives with two operations, one row and one column flip.

with open('tablou.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    n, second_param = map(int, file.readline().split())
    
    operations = []
    if p == 1:
        for _ in range(second_param):
            line = file.readline().strip()
            op, idx = line.split()
            operations.append((op, int(idx)))
        result = solve_case_1(n, operations)
    else:
        result = solve_case_2(n, second_param)

with open('tablou.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

Now, we have included the definition of `solve_case_2`, which was missing earlier. This function is used to solve the second part of the problem. Additionally, I fixed the way operations are read from the file, making sure that the operations list is only filled when `p == 1`, and the operations are relevant.

This solution should now work correctly, not only defining both `solve_case_1` and `solve_case_2` functions but also handling reading from and writing to the files correctly.

The program exited with code 1 again due to a `NameError`, indicating that `solve_case_1` is not defined. My previous message inadvertently omitted the definition of the `solve_case_1` function. To fix the program, I will redefine `solve_case_1` and ensure that both `solve_case_1` and `solve_case_2` are defined in the provided code.

Let's rewrite the entire solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
def solve_case_1(n, operations):
    # Use sets to track rows and columns that have been flipped
    row_flips = set()
    col_flips = set()

    for op, idx in operations:
        if op == 'L':
            if idx in row_flips:
                row_flips.remove(idx)
            else:
                row_flips.add(idx)
        elif op == 'C':
            if idx in col_flips:
                col_flips.remove(idx)
            else:
                col_flips.add(idx)

    # Calculate number of positive cells
    num_positive_rows = n - len(row_flips)
    num_positive_cols = n - len(col_flips)
    num_negative_rows = len(row_flips)
    num_negative_cols = len(col_flips)
    # Positive cells are in positive rows and cols or negative rows and cols
    positive_cells = num_positive_rows * num_positive_cols + num_negative_rows * num_negative_cols
    return positive_cells

def solve_case_2(n, z):
    # If Z is a multiple of N, or the complement of Z is a multiple of N, one operation is needed
    if z % n == 0 or (n * n - z) % n == 0:
        return 1
    # Otherwise, we can always achieve Z negatives with exactly two operations
    return 2

# Read input data
with open('tablou.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    n, second_param = map(int, file.readline().split())
    
    if p == 1:
        operations = [(line.split()[0], int(line.split()[1])) for line in file]
        result = solve_case_1(n, operations)
    else:
        result = solve_case_2(n, second_param)

# Write output data
with open('tablou.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

Now both functions `solve_case_1` and `solve_case_2` are defined, and this complete solution should work as expected, providing the correct output for both parts of the problem.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output for `solve_case_2` indicates that the logic used to determine the number of operations required to achieve exactly `Z` negative values is incorrect. The previous assumption that we could always achieve `Z` negatives with exactly two operations (other than the special cases) was wrong.

To correctly implement `solve_case_2`, we need to logically determine the number of operations required to achieve `Z` negative values. Given the constraints, the minimum number of operations required could be more than two, as we need to consider the configurations that result in `Z` negative cells.

Let's fix the implementation for `solve_case_2`:

```python
def solve_case_2(n, z):
    # The maximum number of negatives we can achieve with one operation is n (by flipping a row or column).
    # The maximum number of negatives we can achieve with two operations is (n-1)*n or n*(n-1),
    # depending on whether we flip a row and then a column, or a column and then a row.
    # If Z is equal to the number of cells (n*n), no operation is needed.
    # If Z is more than n*(n-1), it's impossible to achieve exactly Z negatives with operations.
    if z == n * n:
        return 0
    if z > n * (n - 1) or z < n:
        return 3  # As we need at least one row/column flip and then different operation.
    if z % n == 0:
        return 1
    return 2

# Read input data
with open('tablou.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    n, second_param = map(int, file.readline().split())
    
    if p == 1:
        operations = [(line.split()[0], int(line.split()[1])) for line in file]
        result = solve_case_1(n, operations)
    else:
        result = solve_case_2(n, second_param)

# Write output data
with open('tablou.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

Now the implementation of `solve_case_2` considers the cases where it's impossible to achieve exactly `Z` negatives with only two operations. The case where `Z` is less than `n` or more than `n * (n - 1)` will require at least three operations. This fix should align the solution with the expected results.

It seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous response. The error indicates that the `solve_case_1` function is not defined, which should not be the case since I provided the definition earlier. However, to reconcile this and since the `solve_case_2` implementation had incorrect logic, let's redefine both `solve_case_1` and `solve_case_2` functions along with the main program code.

The correct logic for `solve_case_2` should involve finding the minimum number of row and column flips to achieve exactly `Z` negative cells. This is a more complex problem that involves looking at the possible configurations of row and column flips.

Here's the entire solution, rewritten with the necessary fixes:

```python
def solve_case_1(n, operations):
    row_changes = [False] * (n + 1)
    col_changes = [False] * (n + 1)

    for op, idx in operations:
        if op == 'L':
            row_changes[idx] = not row_changes[idx]  # Flip the state of the row
        elif op == 'C':
            col_changes[idx] = not col_changes[idx]  # Flip the state of the column

    positive_rows = sum(1 for change in row_changes if not change)
    positive_cols = sum(1 for change in col_changes if not change)
    negative_rows = n - positive_rows
    negative_cols = n - positive_cols

    # Calculate the number of positive cells
    positive_cells = positive_rows * positive_cols + negative_rows * negative_cols
    return positive_cells

def solve_case_2(n, z):
    # If Z is a perfect square, then it's the result of flipping an entire sub-square.
    root_z = int(z**0.5)
    if root_z**2 == z:
        return 2 * root_z if root_z != n else 0

    # If Z is less than n, it cannot be achieved since the minimum flip affects n cells.
    if z < n:
        return -1

    # If the number of negative cells needed is less than or equal to n, only one flip is needed.
    if z <= n or (n * n - z) <= n:
        return 1

    # Otherwise, it will take at least 2 flips.
    return 2

# Read input data
with open('tablou.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    n, second_param = map(int, file.readline().split())

    if p == 1:
        operations = [(line.split()[0], int(line.split()[1])) for line in file]
        result = solve_case_1(n, operations)
    else:
        result = solve_case_2(n, second_param)

# Write output data
with open('tablou.out', 'w') as file:
    if result == -1:
        file.write('0\n')  # If it's not possible to achieve Z negatives
    else:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

In the `solve_case_2` function, we check if `Z` is a perfect square, which means that a sub-square area has been flipped to achieve the number of negative cells. If `Z` is less than `n`, it's impossible since the minimum operation flips `n` cells. If `Z` is equal to `n` or its complement with respect to the total number of cells (`n * n - z`) is less than or equal to `n`, then only one flip is needed. If none of these cases apply, then it will take at least 2 flips.

This updated code now includes all necessary logic and should work correctly for both parts of the problem and handle the error cases properly.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result for `solve_case_1` indicates that there is a mistake in the logic used to calculate the number of positive cells after the operations. The way the positive and negative rows and columns are counted leads to an incorrect number of positive cells.

The logic should be as follows: If a row is flipped an odd number of times, then the cells in that row are negative unless the corresponding column is also flipped an odd number of times. Therefore, only cells that are flipped an even number of times (row flip + column flip) remain positive.

Let's correct the logic for `solve_case_1`:

```python
def solve_case_1(n, operations):
    row_changes = [0] * (n + 1)
    col_changes = [0] * (n + 1)

    # Apply the operations and count the number of flips for each row and column.
    for op, idx in operations:
        if op == 'L':
            row_changes[idx] += 1
        elif op == 'C':
            col_changes[idx] += 1

    # Count the number of positive cells by checking the parity of flips.
    positive_cells = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if (row_changes[i] + col_changes[j]) % 2 == 0:
                positive_cells += 1

    return positive_cells

# The solve_case_2 function has logical errors, let's redefine it based on the correct logic.
def solve_case_2(n, z):
    # If Z is exactly n*n, no operations are needed.
    if z == n * n:
        return 0
    # If the Z is a multiple of n, we can achieve it by flipping either rows or columns.
    if z % n == 0:
        return z // n
    # For other cases, we need to find a combination of row and column flips to achieve Z negatives.
    # This can always be done with 2 operations, flipping a row and a column, except when Z is less than n.
    if z < n:
        return -1  # Impossible to achieve Z negatives when Z is less than n.
    # Calculate the minimum number of operations needed.
    row_ops = z // n
    col_ops = 1 if z % n else 0
    return row_ops + col_ops

# Main program to read and write files.
with open('tablou.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    n, second_param = map(int, file.readline().split())

    if p == 1:
        operations = [(line.split()[0], int(line.split()[1])) for line in file]
        result = solve_case_1(n, operations)
    else:
        result = solve_case_2(n, second_param)

with open('tablou.out', 'w') as file:
    if result == -1:
        file.write('0\n')  # If it's impossible to achieve Z negatives
    else:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

Now, `solve_case_1` checks the parity of the flips for each cell to count positive cells, and `solve_case_2` has been corrected to handle cases where `Z` is less than `n` as impossible and computes the minimum number of operations when `Z` is a multiple of `n`. This should provide the correct output for both parts of the problem.
