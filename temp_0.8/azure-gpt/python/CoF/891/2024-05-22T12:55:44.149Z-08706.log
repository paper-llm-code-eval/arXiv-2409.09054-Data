Corina a cumpărat de la magazin un material din pânză colorată, de formă dreptunghiulară pentru a decupa din el o față de masă pentru masa din bucătărie. Fiindcă este pasionată de șah, Corina a ales un material format din $n \times m$ pătrate de aceeași dimensiune colorate cu alb sau negru. Pătratele sunt lipite și sunt dispuse pe linii și coloane paralele cu laturile dreptunghiului din pânză care a fost cumpărat. Două pătrate se numesc vecine dacă au în comun o latură.

Materialul din pânză nu respectă neapărat structura unei table de șah, adică pătratele vecine pe aceeași linie sau pe aceeași coloană nu sunt în mod necesar colorate în mod alternativ.

Corina își propune prin urmare să decupeze un dreptunghi cu un număr maxim de pătrate, paralel cu laturile dreptunghiului din pânză care a fost cumpărat, care să respecte alternanța culorilor pe o tablă de șah.

# Cerință
Să se determine numărul maxim de pătrate întregi ale unui dreptunghi cu laturile paralele cu cele ale materialului cumpărat, care poate fi decupat astfel încât să nu existe două pătrate vecine având aceeași culoare.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul `fadema.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $n$ și $m$ reprezentând numărul de linii, respectiv numărul de coloane ale materialului din pânză care a fost cumpărat.
Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii se află câte $m$ cifre `0` sau `1` despărțite prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând culorile pătratelor materialului. Cifra `0` codifică culoarea albă, iar cifra `1` codifică culoarea neagră.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul `fadema.out` va conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural $A$, reprezentând numărul maxim de pătrate ale unui dreptunghi care poate fi decupat astfel încât să respecte cerința din enunț. Dacă nu există dreptunghiuri cu cel puțin două pătrate având culori alternante, se va scrie valoarea $1$.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $2 \leq N \leq 1\ 000$
- $2 \leq M \leq 1\ 000$
- Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței respectând restricțiile problemei se acordă 90 de puncte.
- Pentru rezultate corecte respectând restricțiile problemei și $n, m \leq 100$ se acordă 20 de puncte.
- Pentru rezultate corecte respectând restricțiile problemei și $n, m \leq 200$ se acordă 40 de puncte.

The issue with the previous code is that it does not correctly calculate the size of the largest chessboard pattern because it only looks at the immediate previous row and column. Also, the maximum size calculation is incorrect since it does not take into account the requirement for alternating colors.

To correctly solve this, we need to consider that for each cell (i, j), we need to track the size of the largest rectangle ending at that cell with both colors (black and white). This rectangle must have alternating colors and extend up and left from the cell.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the matrix from the input file
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize auxiliary matrices to track the size of the largest chess-pattern area ending at each point
dp = [[[1, 1] for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
max_squares = 1

# Fill the dp matrix with the maximum size of the rectangle at each point
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if i and j:  # Not in the first row or column
            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i - 1][j]:
                dp[i][j][0] = dp[i - 1][j][1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j][0] = 1
            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i][j - 1]:
                dp[i][j][1] = dp[i][j - 1][0] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j][1] = 1
        # Calculate the maximum size considering the possible rectangle at (i, j)
        max_squares = max(max_squares, min(dp[i][j]) * 2)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_squares))
```

This code properly initializes the dynamic programming (DP) matrix `dp` with values `[1, 1]` for each cell, which accounts for the fact that a single cell is a valid rectangle of size 1. It then calculates the size of the largest possible rectangle ending at each cell by checking the previous cell in the row and the previous cell in the column while ensuring alternating colors. The size of the rectangle at each cell is the minimum of the two values in `dp[i][j]` times 2 (to account for both colors). Finally, it writes the maximum size found to the output file.

The previously provided solution is still incorrect. It does not properly account for the alternating colors in both dimensions. The issue is that we need to keep track of the maximum size of a rectangle that can be formed with alternating colors at every cell.

To fix this, we must correctly update our dynamic programming state. For each cell, we should keep four states: the maximum width and height of rectangles ending at that cell with both black and white colors (considering the color of the current cell). Then, we must be careful to update these states by checking the values from the cell above and the cell to the left, considering the current cell's color.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Helper function to update dp matrix and calculate max square
def update_dp_and_max_squares(i, j, color):
    if color == matrix[i][j]:
        dp[i][j][color][0] = dp[i][j-1][color][0] + 1
        dp[i][j][color][1] = dp[i-1][j][1-color][1] + 1
        dp[i][j][1-color][0] = dp[i][j-1][1-color][0] + 1
        dp[i][j][1-color][1] = 1  # reset because the color is the same as above
    else:
        dp[i][j][color][0] = 1  # reset because the color is the same as to the left
        dp[i][j][color][1] = dp[i-1][j][color][1] + 1
        dp[i][j][1-color][0] = dp[i][j-1][1-color][0] + 1
        dp[i][j][1-color][1] = dp[i-1][j][1-color][1] + 1

    # Calculate the maximal square that can be formed at (i, j)
    max_width = min(dp[i][j][color][0], dp[i][j][color][1])
    max_height = min(dp[i][j][1-color][0], dp[i][j][1-color][1])
    return min(max_width, max_height)

# Read the matrix from the input file
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize dp matrix: dp[i][j][color] stores [max_width, max_height] for color at cell (i, j)
dp = [[[1, 1] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(m)]
max_squares = 1

# Fill the dp matrix and calculate the maximum size of the chess-pattern rectangle
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if i == 0 or j == 0:
            dp[j][matrix[i][j]][0] = dp[j][matrix[i][j]][1] = 1
        else:
            max_squares = max(max_squares, update_dp_and_max_squares(i, j, 0))
            max_squares = max(max_squares, update_dp_and_max_squares(i, j, 1))

# Write the result to the output file
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_squares))
```

This implementation introduces a helper function `update_dp_and_max_squares` to correctly update the dynamic programming matrix `dp` and calculate the maximum number of squares of the chess-pattern rectangle at each cell. The `dp` matrix stores the maximum width and height for both colors (0 and 1) at each column for the current row. We only need to store the current row's state since we can discard the previous row's state after processing it. The function calculates the maximum size based on the smallest dimension of the formed rectangles, as each rectangle must have alternating colors. Then, the solution writes the maximum size found to the output file `fadema.out`.

The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to assign a value to `dp[i][j][color][0]`. It seems there is a mistake in indexing the `dp` matrix. The `dp` matrix was initialized incorrectly, and the assignment fails because `dp[i][j][color]` is an `int` rather than a list, as expected.

To fix the issue, the `dp` matrix must be initialized correctly, and its use must be consistent with the initialization. Since we only need the information for the current and the previous row, we do not need a full 3D matrix; instead, we can use a 2D matrix that is reset at each row iteration.

Let's correct the implementation with the proper usage of the `dp` matrix:

```python
# Read the matrix from the input file
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize dp matrix: dp[i][color] stores [max_width, max_height] for color at cell (i, color)
dp = [[[0, 0] for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(m)]
max_squares = 1

# Function to update the dp values and find the largest square
def update_dp(i, j):
    global max_squares
    if i == 0 or j == 0:  # Reset dp for the first row/column
        dp[j][matrix[i][j]] = [1, 1]
    else:
        if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i-1][j]:  # If current color is different from above
            dp[j][matrix[i][j]][1] = dp[j][1 - matrix[i][j]][1] + 1
        else:
            dp[j][matrix[i][j]][1] = 1

        if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i][j-1]:  # If current color is different from left
            dp[j][matrix[i][j]][0] = dp[j-1][1 - matrix[i][j]][0] + 1
        else:
            dp[j][matrix[i][j]][0] = 1

    # Calculate the max possible square ending at (i, j) with color matrix[i][j]
    height = dp[j][matrix[i][j]][1]
    width = dp[j][matrix[i][j]][0]
    side_length = min(height, width)
    max_squares = max(max_squares, side_length**2)

# Iterate over each cell to update the dp values and find the largest square
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        update_dp(i, j)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_squares))
```

In this corrected version, the `dp` matrix is now a 2D array of size `[m][2]`, where `m` is the number of columns. Each `dp[j][color]` contains a list of two integers representing the maximum width and height of a rectangle that ends at column `j` and has a bottom-right corner of color `color`. The `update_dp` function updates the dynamic programming matrix and calculates the maximum size of a square (not a rectangle) for each cell. It checks the color of the current cell and the colors of the neighboring cells to the left and above, updating the `dp` values accordingly. It also calculates the size of the largest possible square at that cell and updates `max_squares` if a larger square is found. Finally, the solution writes the maximum area to the output file `fadema.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to the fact that the above solution is calculating the maximum size of a square, not a rectangle. The problem statement asks for the largest rectangle with alternating colors, and the calculation should not be limited to squares. The solution needs to be adjusted to account for rectangles of varying dimensions.

Here is a revised solution that correctly calculates the largest possible rectangle with alternating colors:

```python
# Read the matrix from the input file
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize auxiliary matrices to track the size of the largest chess-pattern area ending at each point
dp = [[[0, 0] for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(2)]  # we need only 2 rows of dp at any time

max_area = 1

# Fill the dp matrix with the maximum size of the rectangle at each point
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if i == 0 or j == 0:
            dp[i % 2][j][matrix[i][j]] = 1  # First row or first column
            max_area = max(max_area, dp[i % 2][j][matrix[i][j]])
        else:
            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i][j - 1]:
                dp[i % 2][j][0] = dp[i % 2][j - 1][1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i % 2][j][0] = 1

            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i - 1][j]:
                dp[i % 2][j][1] = dp[(i - 1) % 2][j][0] + 1
            else:
                dp[i % 2][j][1] = 1

            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i - 1][j - 1]:
                # check the minimum rectangle size from top and left
                width = dp[i % 2][j][0]
                height = dp[i % 2][j][1]
                # we check the area at (i - height + 1, j - width + 1) for a possible rectangle
                possible_area = min(dp[(i - height + 1) % 2][j - width + 1][1], height) * width
                max_area = max(max_area, possible_area)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_area))
```

This solution maintains a DP array that tracks the largest possible width and height of rectangles ending at each cell that have alternating colors. It uses the modulus operator to alternate between two rows (current and previous) in DP to save space. It calculates the maximum possible rectangle area for each cell by checking the minimum height from the top and the current width, then compares it with the maximum area found so far. Finally, the largest area is written to `fadema.out`.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. The solution provided did not accurately find the largest possible rectangle with alternating colors. We will need to reconsider the approach.

The correct approach to this problem is to use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum alternating rectangle at each cell `(i, j)`. For each cell, we can keep two variables: one for the maximum height of the alternating rectangle ending at `(i, j)` and one for the maximum width. We will update these values based on the values above and to the left of the current cell while ensuring that they alternate in color.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_alternating_rectangle(matrix, n, m):
    # Initialize DP arrays for heights and widths of alternating rectangles
    height = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    width = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    max_area = 1

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if i == 0 or j == 0:  # For the first row and first column
                height[i][j] = width[i][j] = 1
            else:
                if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i - 1][j]:  # Compare to above
                    height[i][j] = height[i - 1][j] + 1
                else:
                    height[i][j] = 1

                if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i][j - 1]:  # Compare to left
                    width[i][j] = width[i][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    width[i][j] = 1

            # For each cell, calculate the max rectangle area considering the heights and widths
            # minimum height for the current width (going back in columns)
            min_height = height[i][j]
            for k in range(width[i][j]):
                min_height = min(min_height, height[i][j - k])  # Find the min height for the width
                max_area = max(max_area, (k + 1) * min_height)  # Update the maximum area

    return max_area

# Read the matrix from the input file
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the max area
max_area = calculate_max_alternating_rectangle(matrix, n, m)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_area))
```

In this solution, for each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, we calculate the height and width of the largest alternating rectangle ending at that cell. If a cell has a different color from the cell above, its height is one more than the height of the cell above. The same logic applies to width with respect to the cell to the left. We then iterate backward to find the minimum height for all possible widths ending at `(i, j)` and calculate the area of rectangles that can be formed, updating `max_area` with the largest area found. The maximum area is then written to the output file `fadema.out`.
