Gigel este un mare pasionat al cifrelor. Orice moment liber şi-l petrece jucându-se cu numere. Jucându-se astfel, într-o zi a scris pe hârtie $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi a observat că printre acestea există două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală. Desigur, Gigel a crezut că este o întâmplare şi a scris alte $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi spre surpriza lui, după un timp a găsit din nou două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală.

# Cerinţă
Date $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre, determinaţi numărul de perechi de submulţimi **disjuncte** de sumă egală care se pot forma cu numere din cele date, precum şi una dintre aceste perechi pentru care suma numerelor din fiecare dintre cele două submulţimi este maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `numere.in` conţine pe prima linie $10$ numere naturale distincte separate prin câte un spaţiu $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_{10}$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `numere.out` conţine trei linii. Pe prima linie se află numărul de perechi de submulţimi de sumă egală şi suma maximă obţinută, separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe linia a doua se află elementele primei submulţimi separate prin câte un spațiu, iar pe linia a treia se află elementele celei de a doua submulţimi separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 99$, pentru $1 \leq i \leq 10$
- $1 \leq k, p \leq 9$
- Ordinea submulţimilor în perechi nu contează.
- Perechea de submulţimi determinată nu este obligatoriu unică.

from itertools import combinations

# Helper function to find all possible combinations of the given numbers
def find_subsets(s, n):
    return [set(combo) for i in range(1, len(s) + 1) for combo in combinations(s, i)]

# Helper function to check for equal sum disjunct subsets and find the maximum sum
def find_equal_sum_pairs(numbers):

    max_pair = None

    for i, subset1 in enumerate(subsets):
        for subset2 in subsets[i+1:]:
            # Check if subsets are disjunct
            if subset1.isdisjoint(subset2):
                sum1 = sum(subset1)
                sum2 = sum(subset2)
                # Check if sum is equal and store it in the dictionary
                if sum1 == sum2:
                    found_pairs[frozenset(subset1)] = frozenset(subset2)
                    # Update the maximum sum
                    if sum1 > max_sum:
                        max_sum = sum1
                        max_pair = (subset1, subset2)
    return found_pairs, max_pair

# Read the input from the file 
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data and find the pairs
pairs, max_pair = find_equal_sum_pairs(numbers)
num_pairs = len(pairs) // 2  # Each pair is counted twice (subset1, subset2) and (subset2, subset1)

# Write the answer to the file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of pairs and the maximum sum
    file.write(f"{num_pairs} {sum(max_pair[0])}\n")
    # Write the elements of the first subset
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(max_pair[0]))) + '\n')
    # Write the elements of the second subset
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(max_pair[1]))))
```

This program reads the 10 numbers from `numere.in`, finds all possible combinations of subsets, checks for pairs with equal sums that are disjoint, finds the number of such pairs, identifies the pair with the maximum sum, and then writes the number of pairs, the maximum sum, and the elements of the pair with the maximum sum to `numere.out`. The subsets in the output are sorted for readability.

The expected output indicates there are 65 pairs of submultimi disjuncte of sumă egală, while my initial solution indicates there are 29 such pairs—a discrepancy that arises from how I'm counting pairs. In my initial solution, I divided the number of found pairs by two to account for duplicates. This seems incorrect because each subset can form a unique pair with multiple other subsets. Hence, the output would have fewer pairs than expected. Let me correct the logic for counting pairs and also ensure the subsets are printed according to the example.

The correct approach doesn't involve dividing the count of pairs by two. Instead, we need to ensure each pair is only counted once. This fix will likely also solve the discrepancy in the order of subsets in the output file, which should match the example given.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Helper function to find all possible combinations of the given numbers
def find_subsets(s, n):
    return [set(combo) for i in range(1, len(s) + 1) for combo in combinations(s, i)]

# Helper function to check for equal sum disjunct subsets and find the maximum sum
def find_equal_sum_pairs(numbers):
    subsets = find_subsets(numbers, 10)
    seen_sums = {}
    max_sum = 0
    max_pair = None

    for subset in subsets:
        subset_sum = sum(subset)
        if subset_sum in seen_sums:
            for seen_subset in seen_sums[subset_sum]:
                if subset.isdisjoint(seen_subset):
                    # Update the maximum sum
                    if subset_sum > max_sum:
                        max_sum = subset_sum
                        max_pair = (subset, seen_subset)
            seen_sums[subset_sum].append(subset)
        else:
            seen_sums[subset_sum] = [subset]

    # Count unique pairs
    num_pairs = sum(len(seen_sums[s]) * (len(seen_sums[s]) - 1) // 2 for s in seen_sums)

    return num_pairs, max_pair

# Read the input from the file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data and find the pairs
num_pairs, max_pair = find_equal_sum_pairs(numbers)

# Write the answer to the file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of pairs and the maximum sum
    file.write(f"{num_pairs} {sum(max_pair[0])}\n")
    # Write the elements of the first subset
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    # Write the elements of the second subset
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])))
```

This revised solution should now count the number of unique pairs correctly without dividing by two and should write the subsets in the output file in a way that matches the example given. It uses a dictionary to map subset sums to a list of subsets, which allows us to efficiently find and count all pairs with equal sums. The pair with the maximum sum is updated whenever a new maximum is found.

The main issue seems to be with the way we are counting the pairs and finding the maximum. The previous solutions did not account for the unique pairs correctly, which resulted in an incorrect count and ordering of subsets.

The correct way to handle this is to use a map that keeps track of which subsets have been paired, to avoid counting a pair more than once. Additionally, we need to ensure that the subsets that form the pair with the maximum sum are printed in the correct order, as shown in the expected output.

Let's rewrite the solution to address these issues:

```python
from itertools import product

# Function to calculate sum of subsets and keep track of their indices
def subset_sums(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    sum_map = {}
    for r in range(1, n+1):
        for indices in combinations(range(n), r):
            subset_sum = sum(numbers[i] for i in indices)
            if subset_sum not in sum_map:
                sum_map[subset_sum] = []
            sum_map[subset_sum].append(indices)
    return sum_map

# Read the input from the file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate sum map of subsets and their indices
sum_map = subset_sums(numbers)

# Find pairs of subsets with equal sum
num_pairs = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())
for subset_sum, indices_list in sum_map.items():
    # For each pair of indices combinations that have the same sum
    for indices_pair in combinations(indices_list, 2):
        # If two subsets are disjoint, it's a valid pair
        if not set(indices_pair[0]).intersection(indices_pair[1]):
            num_pairs += 1
            if subset_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = subset_sum
                max_pair = indices_pair

# Prepare the output data
max_pair_subsets = tuple(sorted(numbers[i] for i in indices) for indices in max_pair)

# Write the answer to the file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair_subsets[0])) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair_subsets[1])))
```

This solution uses a combination of subset indices to keep track of unique subsets and their sums, ensuring that each pair is counted only once. The subsets that result in the maximum sum are tracked separately, and their indices are used to get the actual numbers for the output. The pairs of subsets are ensured to be disjoint before being considered valid. Finally, the subsets are sorted as per the expected output.

The error occurred because the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module is being used, but the module is not imported. The error message `NameError: name 'combinations' is not defined` indicates that Python does not recognize `combinations` as it has not been defined or imported in the script.

To fix this issue, we need to import the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module at the beginning of our script. Here's the corrected Python code with the necessary import statement:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Function to calculate sum of subsets and keep track of their indices
def subset_sums(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    sum_map = {}
    for r in range(1, n+1):
        for indices in combinations(range(n), r):
            subset_sum = sum(numbers[i] for i in indices)
            if subset_sum not in sum_map:
                sum_map[subset_sum] = []
            sum_map[subset_sum].append(indices)
    return sum_map

# Read the input from the file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate sum map of subsets and their indices
sum_map = subset_sums(numbers)

# Find pairs of subsets with equal sum
num_pairs = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())
for subset_sum, indices_list in sum_map.items():
    # For each pair of indices combinations that have the same sum
    for indices_pair in combinations(indices_list, 2):
        # If two subsets are disjoint, it's a valid pair
        if not set(indices_pair[0]).intersection(indices_pair[1]):
            num_pairs += 1
            if subset_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = subset_sum
                max_pair = indices_pair

# Prepare the output data
max_pair_subsets = tuple(sorted(numbers[i] for i in indices) for indices in max_pair)

    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair_subsets[0])) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair_subsets[1])))
```

With the `combinations` function properly imported, the script should run without encountering the `NameError` and produce the correct output.

The primary issue seems to be the ordering of the output subsets. While the counts match, the expected output has the subsets in a specific order that my program does not replicate. To ensure the output matches the expected result, we can modify the program to sort the subsets according to their first elements before writing them to the file.

Here is the corrected solution with this modification:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Function to calculate sum of subsets and keep track of their indices
def subset_sums(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    sum_map = {}
    for r in range(1, n+1):
        for indices in combinations(range(n), r):
            subset_sum = sum(numbers[i] for i in indices)
            if subset_sum not in sum_map:
                sum_map[subset_sum] = []
            sum_map[subset_sum].append(indices)
    return sum_map

# Read the input from the file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate sum map of subsets and their indices
sum_map = subset_sums(numbers)

# Find pairs of subsets with equal sum
num_pairs = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())
for subset_sum, indices_list in sum_map.items():
    for indices_pair in combinations(indices_list, 2):
        if not set(indices_pair[0]).intersection(indices_pair[1]):
            num_pairs += 1
            if subset_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = subset_sum
                # Sort the pairs by the first element of the pair to match the expected output
                max_pair = tuple(sorted((numbers[i] for i in pair), reverse=True) for pair in indices_pair)

# Since we want the pair with max sum and the pair itself in the specific order,
# we need to sort the two subsets to ensure the correct order
max_pair_subsets = sorted(max_pair, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)

# Write the answer to the file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    for subset in max_pair_subsets:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, subset)) + '\n')
```

This solution maintains the count and maximum sum logic from the previous answer but adds sorting to the subsets based on their first element, ensuring the output order matches the expected. The subsets with the maximum sum are sorted in descending order before being written to the file. The final subsets are also sorted by their first element to ensure they match the expected output order.

Analyzing the previous attempt, it seems that sorting the individual subsets by their first element was not the right approach to match the expected output. Instead, we need to ensure the pair of subsets is ordered such that the subset containing the greater number appears first.

Let's correct the program with this change in mind. We will compare the maximum elements in each subset to determine the order in which they should be written. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_subsets(numbers):
    # Generate all possible non-empty subsets of numbers
    all_subsets = []
    for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
        subset = [numbers[j] for j in range(len(numbers)) if (i & (1 << j))]
        all_subsets.append(subset)
    return all_subsets

def find_equal_sum_pairs(subsets):
    sum_dict = {}
    for subset in subsets:
        subset_sum = sum(subset)
        if subset_sum not in sum_dict:
            sum_dict[subset_sum] = []
        sum_dict[subset_sum].append(subset)
    
    num_pairs = 0
    max_sum = 0
    max_pairs = []
    
    # Iterate over the sums and find pairs
    for subset_sum, subset_list in sum_dict.items():
        while len(subset_list) > 1:
            s1 = subset_list.pop()
            for s2 in subset_list:
                if not set(s1).intersection(s2):  # Check for disjoint subsets
                    num_pairs += 1
                    if subset_sum > max_sum:
                        max_sum = subset_sum
                        max_pairs = [s1, s2]
    
    return num_pairs, max_sum, max_pairs

# Read the input from the file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate all non-empty subsets of the list of numbers
subsets = find_subsets(numbers)

# Find all pairs of subsets with equal sum and the pair with the maximum sum
num_pairs, max_sum, max_pairs = find_equal_sum_pairs(subsets)

# Order the max pair according to the problem statement
max_pairs.sort(key=max, reverse=True)

# Write the answer to the file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    for pair in max_pairs:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(pair))) + '\n')
```

This solution should now generate the correct number of pairs, find the correct maximum sum, and correctly order the pairs for the output. We sort the list of pairs using the max function as the key to ensure the subset with the larger maximum number comes first. Then when writing to the file, we ensure the numbers within each subset are sorted in ascending order as seen in the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to the incorrect ordering of the subsets in the output file. The expected output has a specific order of subsets, which is not being replicated by the previous code. I'll address this by ensuring that the subsets are ordered such that the subset with the greater maximum number appears first in the output file and that within each subset, the numbers are sorted in ascending order.

Let's correct the algorithm to produce the correct order:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Function to calculate the sum of subsets and keep track of their indices
def subset_sums(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    sum_map = {}
    for r in range(1, n+1):
        for indices in combinations(range(n), r):
            subset_sum = sum(numbers[i] for i in indices)
            if subset_sum not in sum_map:
                sum_map[subset_sum] = []
            sum_map[subset_sum].append(indices)
    return sum_map

# Read the input from the file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate sum map of subsets and their indices
sum_map = subset_sums(numbers)

# Find pairs of subsets with equal sum
num_pairs = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())
for subset_sum, indices_list in sum_map.items():
    for indices_pair in combinations(indices_list, 2):
        if not set(indices_pair[0]).intersection(indices_pair[1]):
            num_pairs += 1
            if subset_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = subset_sum
                max_pair = indices_pair

# Convert indices to actual numbers and sort within subsets
max_pair_subsets = [sorted(numbers[i] for i in indices) for indices in max_pair]

# Make sure the subset with the largest number comes first
max_pair_subsets.sort(key=lambda s: max(s), reverse=True)

# Write the answer to the file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_pairs // 2} {max_sum}\n")  # Divide by 2 to get unique pairs

In this corrected algorithm, after finding the pair with the maximum sum, we ensure the subsets are sorted individually. Then, we sort the pair of subsets based on the largest number contained in them, ensuring the subset with the largest maximum number appears first in the output. Finally, we divide the `num_pairs` by 2 to count each unique pair only once, as each pair is found twice in the opposite order during the search.
