Gigel este un mare pasionat al cifrelor. Orice moment liber şi-l petrece jucându-se cu numere. Jucându-se astfel, într-o zi a scris pe hârtie $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi a observat că printre acestea există două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală. Desigur, Gigel a crezut că este o întâmplare şi a scris alte $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi spre surpriza lui, după un timp a găsit din nou două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală.

# Cerinţă
Date $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre, determinaţi numărul de perechi de submulţimi **disjuncte** de sumă egală care se pot forma cu numere din cele date, precum şi una dintre aceste perechi pentru care suma numerelor din fiecare dintre cele două submulţimi este maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `numere.in` conţine pe prima linie $10$ numere naturale distincte separate prin câte un spaţiu $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_{10}$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `numere.out` conţine trei linii. Pe prima linie se află numărul de perechi de submulţimi de sumă egală şi suma maximă obţinută, separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe linia a doua se află elementele primei submulţimi separate prin câte un spațiu, iar pe linia a treia se află elementele celei de a doua submulţimi separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 99$, pentru $1 \leq i \leq 10$
- $1 \leq k, p \leq 9$
- Ordinea submulţimilor în perechi nu contează.
- Perechea de submulţimi determinată nu este obligatoriu unică.

This script reads from "numere.in", calculates the number of pairs of disjoint subsets of equal sum, finds the pair with the maximum sum, and writes the results to "numere.out". The function `generate_subsets` is used to generate all subsets with a given target sum, and `find_equal_sum_subsets` utilizes these subsets to find all valid pairs and the pair with the maximum sum. The `read_numbers` and `write_output` functions handle file I/O.

The original solution is incorrect because it is not properly calculating the sum of the subsets, and it's not finding the subset pair that yields the maximum sum. Additionally, the algorithm generates all possible subsets of a given target sum rather than all possible subsets in general. It also does not sort subsets when writing to the file, which is required for proper comparison with the expected output.

To correct this, I will change the approach to:
1. Generate all possible subsets using binary representation of numbers from 1 to 2^10 - 1.
2. Store the sum of each subset in a dictionary with the subset's binary representation as the key.
3. Find all pairs of subsets (disjoint) that have the same sum, and keep track of the pair with the maximum sum.
4. Write the correct output to the file, ensuring subsets are sorted.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def subsets_sums(numbers):
    subset_sum = {}
    n = len(numbers)
    for i in range(1, 1 << n):
        current_subset = [numbers[j] for j in range(n) if (i & (1 << j))]
        current_sum = sum(current_subset)
        subset_sum.setdefault(current_sum, []).append(i)
    return subset_sum

def max_sum_pair(subset_sum):
    max_sum = 0
    max_pair = (0, 0)
    for sum_val, subsets in subset_sum.items():
        for i in range(len(subsets)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(subsets)):
                if subsets[i] & subsets[j] == 0:  # disjoint subsets
                    if sum_val > max_sum:
                        max_sum = sum_val
                        max_pair = (subsets[i], subsets[j])
    return max_sum, max_pair

def write_output(filename, count, max_sum, max_pair, numbers):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
        subset1 = [numbers[j] for j in range(10) if (max_pair[0] & (1 << j))]
        subset2 = [numbers[j] for j in range(10) if (max_pair[1] & (1 << j))]
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(subset1))) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(subset2))) + '\n')

def main():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    subset_sum = subsets_sums(numbers)
    max_sum, max_pair = max_sum_pair(subset_sum)
    count = sum(len(subsets) * (len(subsets) - 1) // 2 for subsets in subset_sum.values())
    
    write_output('numere.out', count, max_sum, max_pair, numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should correctly find the number of pairs of disjoint subsets of equal sum, identify the pair with the maximum sum, and write the correct output to "numere.out". The subsets are sorted before being written to the file to match the expected output.

The previous solution incorrectly calculated the total count of subset pairs and did not match the expected output because it counted all possible pairs of subsets with equal sums, regardless of whether they were disjoint or not. To correct this, we must ensure that we only count and consider disjoint subset pairs. Additionally, we need to ensure that the subsets we select for the maximum sum pair are correctly identified.

Let's rewrite the solution by focusing on finding only disjoint subset pairs and ensuring the pair with the maximum sum is selected correctly:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_subsets(numbers, subset_size):
    return [frozenset(comb) for comb in combinations(numbers, subset_size)]

def main():
    # Read numbers from file
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    
    # Find all non-empty subsets
    all_subsets = []
    for r in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
        all_subsets.extend(find_subsets(numbers, r))
    
    # Generate all pairs of disjoint subsets with equal sums
    subset_pairs = {}
    for subset in all_subsets:
        subset_sum = sum(subset)
        if subset_sum not in subset_pairs:
            subset_pairs[subset_sum] = []
        subset_pairs[subset_sum].append(subset)
    
    # Find the count and the maximum sum pair
    count = 0
    max_sum = 0
    max_subset_pair = (set(), set())
    for sum_val, subsets_list in subset_pairs.items():
        for i, subset_A in enumerate(subsets_list):
            for subset_B in subsets_list[i+1:]:
                if subset_A.isdisjoint(subset_B):
                    count += 1
                    if sum_val > max_sum:
                        max_sum = sum_val
                        max_subset_pair = (subset_A, subset_B)
    
    # Write the result to file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(str(num) for num in sorted(max_subset_pair[0])) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(str(num) for num in sorted(max_subset_pair[1])) + '\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated solution should meet the requirements:
- It reads the numbers from `numere.in` and generates all non-empty subsets of the given set of numbers.
- It then iterates over these subsets and groups them by their sums, storing them in a dictionary where the key is the sum and the value is a list of subsets with that sum.
- For each list of subsets with the same sum, it finds all pairs of disjoint subsets and counts them, while also tracking the pair with the maximum sum.
- Finally, it writes the output to `numere.out` with the total number of disjoint subset pairs, the maximum sum, and the subsets that make up the pair with the maximum sum.

The previous implementation seems to be counting the pairs correctly and also finds a pair of subsets with the maximum sum, but the output still does not match the expected output. The problem might not be with the logic of finding pairs or counting them but with how the results are presented in the output file.

The expected output lists subsets in a particular order, and while the program does produce a valid pair of subsets with the maximum sum, they may not be in the same order as in the expected output. However, the problem statement specifies that the order of the subsets in the pairs does not matter. Thus, the program's logic appears to be correct, and it's meeting the challenge requirements. 

The expected output may be one of many correct answers, and the program provides another valid solution. If the goal is to match the expected output exactly, we need to implement additional logic to prioritize the order of the elements in the output to match the given example.

However, as per the problem statement, any correct pair of subsets with the maximum sum is acceptable. Therefore, it is not necessary to prioritize the order of the subsets in the output. If the challenge requires producing the output in a specific order for testing purposes, the testing framework should account for the fact that multiple correct answers are possible and validate accordingly.

Here is the solution that produces a valid output, which may not necessarily match the expected output exactly but is correct according to the problem statement:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_subsets(numbers, subset_size):
    return [frozenset(comb) for comb in combinations(numbers, subset_size)]

def main():
    # Read numbers from file
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    
    # Find all non-empty subsets
    all_subsets = []
    for r in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
        all_subsets.extend(find_subsets(numbers, r))
    
    # Generate all pairs of disjoint subsets with equal sums
    subset_pairs = {}
    for subset in all_subsets:
        subset_sum = sum(subset)
        if subset_sum not in subset_pairs:
            subset_pairs[subset_sum] = []
        subset_pairs[subset_sum].append(subset)
    
    # Find the count and the maximum sum pair
    count = 0
    max_sum = 0
    max_subset_pair = (set(), set())
    for sum_val, subsets_list in subset_pairs.items():
        for i, subset_A in enumerate(subsets_list):
            for subset_B in subsets_list[i+1:]:
                if subset_A.isdisjoint(subset_B):
                    count += 1
                    if sum_val > max_sum:
                        max_sum = sum_val
                        max_subset_pair = (subset_A, subset_B)
    
    # Write the result to file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(str(num) for num in sorted(max_subset_pair[0])) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(str(num) for num in sorted(max_subset_pair[1])) + '\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This solution will still yield a correct pair of subsets with the maximum sum, and the count of disjoint subset pairs with equal sums. The output is correct and valid, even if it may not match the expected output exactly due to the non-uniqueness of the solution.

The difference between the expected output and the found output is in the specific subsets that were chosen for the maximum sum, while both outputs are correct in terms of the number of subset pairs and the maximum sum value. However, I will attempt to match the expected output exactly by re-implementing the solution with a more deterministic approach.

According to the problem statement, we need to find all the pairs of disjoint subsets where the sum is equal. To find the maximum sum, we need to consider larger values first, as the problem statement indicates that the solution is not necessarily unique.

To ensure we match the expected output, we will create a list of all possible subset pairs and then sort this list in descending order of their sums. We will then select the first pair, which should give us the maximum sum pair.

Here is the rewritten solution:

```python
def get_subsets(numbers):
    all_subsets = []
    for i in range(1 << len(numbers)):
        subset = [numbers[j] for j in range(len(numbers)) if (i & (1 << j))]
        if subset:
            all_subsets.append(subset)
    return all_subsets

def find_pairs(subsets):
    sum_to_subsets = {}
    for subset in subsets:
        subset_sum = sum(subset)
        if subset_sum in sum_to_subsets:
            sum_to_subsets[subset_sum].append(subset)
        else:
            sum_to_subsets[subset_sum] = [subset]
    
    pairs = []
    for subsets_with_same_sum in sum_to_subsets.values():
        for i, subset1 in enumerate(subsets_with_same_sum):
            for subset2 in subsets_with_same_sum[i + 1:]:
                if not set(subset1) & set(subset2):  # Ensure subsets are disjoint
                    pairs.append((subset1, subset2))
    return pairs

def main():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    subsets = get_subsets(numbers)
    pairs = find_pairs(subsets)
    max_pair_sum = 0
    max_pair = (None, None)
    
    for pair in pairs:
        pair_sum = sum(pair[0])  # Both subsets in the pair have the same sum
        if pair_sum > max_pair_sum:
            max_pair_sum = pair_sum
            max_pair = pair
    
    # Output the results
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(pairs)} {max_pair_sum}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(max_pair[0]))) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(max_pair[1]))) + '\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code generates all possible subsets, finds all pairs of disjoint subsets with equal sums, and then selects the pair with the maximum sum. It should match the expected output more closely, as we are explicitly sorting subsets within each pair when writing to the output.

The differences between the expected and found result are due to the ordering of the subsets in the maximum sum pair. The algorithm is finding a correct pair of subsets with the maximum sum, but it's not necessarily the same pair as in the expected output.

A potential fix to this issue is to ensure we check all possible subset pairs and, when we find multiple pairs with the same maximum sum, we choose the pair that comes first lexicographically. To achieve this, we should store all maximum sum pairs and then sort them to find the pair that comes first lexicographically.

Here's the revised solution that addresses this requirement:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def get_all_subsets(numbers):
    subsets = []
    for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
        subset = [numbers[j] for j in range(len(numbers)) if i & (1 << j)]
        subsets.append(subset)
    return subsets

def main():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    
    all_subsets = get_all_subsets(numbers)
    sum_to_subsets = {}
    for subset in all_subsets:
        subset_sum = sum(subset)
        sum_to_subsets.setdefault(subset_sum, []).append(subset)
    
    max_sum = 0
    max_pairs = []
    for subset_sum, subsets in sum_to_subsets.items():
        for subset_a in subsets:
            for subset_b in subsets:
                if set(subset_a).isdisjoint(set(subset_b)):
                    if subset_sum > max_sum:
                        max_sum = subset_sum
                        max_pairs = [(subset_a, subset_b)]
                    elif subset_sum == max_sum:
                        max_pairs.append((subset_a, subset_b))

    # Sort pairs and choose the one that comes first lexicographically
    max_pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: (sorted(pair[0]), sorted(pair[1])))
    chosen_pair = max_pairs[0]

    # Count all unique pairs
    count = sum(len(subsets) * (len(subsets) - 1) // 2 for subsets in sum_to_subsets.values())

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(str(num) for num in sorted(chosen_pair[0])) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(str(num) for num in sorted(chosen_pair[1])) + '\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code should produce the expected output. It generates all subsets, identifies pairs with the same sum, finds the maximum sum, and then sorts all pairs with the maximum sum lexicographically. The first pair in this sorted list is chosen as the output. The count is calculated as the sum of the half-products of the lengths of the subset lists.

The issues with the previous solution lie in incorrect pair counting and selection of maximum sum subset pairs. The expected output indicates we are looking for the number of unique pairs of disjoint subsets that have an equal sum, and we must also select the pair of subsets that have the highest possible sum. 

The count should only include unique pairs of disjoint subsets. Additionally, when there are multiple pairs with the maximum sum, we must select the two subsets that are lexicographically first.

To fix the solution, we will:
1. Find all unique pairs of disjoint subsets with an equal sum.
2. Keep track of the pair with the maximum sum.
3. If there are multiple, select the lexicographically first pair.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def get_subsets(numbers):
    # Generate all possible non-empty subsets using bitwise operations
    all_subsets = []
    for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
        subset = [numbers[j] for j in range(len(numbers)) if (i & (1 << j))]
        all_subsets.append(subset)
    return all_subsets

def main():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    numbers.sort()  # Sort numbers to help with lexicographical ordering

    all_subsets = get_subsets(numbers)
    subset_sums = {}
    max_sum = -1
    max_pair = ()

    # Map each subset sum to its corresponding subsets and find max sum pair
    for subset in all_subsets:
        subset_sum = sum(subset)
        if subset_sum in subset_sums:
            for other_subset in subset_sums[subset_sum]:
                if not set(subset).intersection(other_subset):
                    # Find the max sum pair
                    if subset_sum > max_sum:
                        max_sum = subset_sum
                        max_pair = (other_subset, subset)
                    elif subset_sum == max_sum:
                        max_pair = min(max_pair, (other_subset, subset), key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        subset_sums.setdefault(subset_sum, []).append(subset)

    # Count unique pairs
    count = 0
    for subsets in subset_sums.values():
        count += len(subsets) * (len(subsets) - 1) // 2

    # Write the result to file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
        # Write the subsets in lexicographical order
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution ensures that the subsets are sorted lexicographically, and uses the `min` function with a key to lexicographically compare two pairs when they have the same sum. The corrected solution should provide the expected output.
