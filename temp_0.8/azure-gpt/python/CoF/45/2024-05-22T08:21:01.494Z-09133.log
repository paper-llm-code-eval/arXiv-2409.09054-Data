Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

This solution uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations for the same subtree with the same carrot limit, significantly improving the time complexity for larger trees. The solution should correctly solve the problem and provide the answer modulo `30 011`.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's analyze the issue and correct the logic.

The previous solution incorrectly accumulates the total number of ways by always distributing exactly one carrot less to each subordinate. However, each subordinate can have between 1 and `carrots-1` carrots, not exactly `carrots-1`. We must consider all possible distributions of carrots to the subordinates and not just the case where each subordinate gets one less carrot. Also, the problem requires us to distribute carrots to the hierarchy such that each subordinate gets at least one more carrot than its superior.

Here is the corrected and optimized solution:

```python
def get_input():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        children = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            children[a].append(b)
    return N, K, children

def dfs(v, children, dp, K, MOD):
    dp[v][0] = 1
    for c in children[v]:
        dfs(c, children, dp, K, MOD)
        for j in range(K, -1, -1):
            dp[v][j] = dp[v][j] * (sum(dp[c][:j]) % MOD) % MOD

def solve(N, K, children):
    MOD = 30011
    dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
    dfs(1, children, dp, K, MOD)
    return sum(dp[1]) % MOD

def write_output(result):
    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

N, K, children = get_input()
result = solve(N, K, children)
write_output(result)
```

Let's review the main changes and improvements:

1. We use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the hierarchy. During the DFS, we calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots to the subtree rooted at each node.

2. `dp[v][j]` represents the number of ways to distribute carrots to the subtree rooted at node `v` such that `v` has exactly `j` carrots.

3. During the DFS, when processing a node `v`, we iterate over its children and update `dp[v]` based on the number of ways the children can be fed with fewer carrots than `v`.

4. After the DFS is done, we calculate the total number of ways to feed Rilă Iepurilă and its subordinates by summing up `dp[1]`.

5. We write the final result modulo `30011` to the output file.

This corrected solution should now produce the expected output.

I will carefully re-evaluate the problem and fix the logic to ensure we get the expected result of `9` for the given input data.

The problem here is that, in the initial solution, we didn't correctly compute the number of ways to distribute the carrots to the subordinates accounting for the fact that each subordinate can get between 1 and `K` carrots, while each superior gets between 1 and `subordinate carrots - 1`.

Let's rewrite the solution, taking into account these conditions:

```python
def get_input():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        children = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            children[b].append(a)  # Change: Storing parents of each node
    return N, K, children

def dfs(v, children, dp, K, MOD):
    # Base case: if a node has no children, it can eat from 1 to K carrots
    if not children[v]:
        for j in range(1, K+1):
            dp[v][j] = 1
        return

    # First, run dfs for all children to fill their dp values
    for c in children[v]:
        dfs(c, children, dp, K, MOD)

    # Now compute the number of ways to distribute carrots for node v
    for j in range(1, K+1):  # Number of carrots for the current node
        ways = 1
        for c in children[v]:
            sum_ways = sum(dp[c][j+1:]) % MOD  # Children must have more carrots
            ways = (ways * sum_ways) % MOD
        dp[v][j] = ways

def solve(N, K, children):
    MOD = 30011
    dp = [[0] * (K + 2) for _ in range(N + 1)]  # Change: Added K+2 for ease of indexing
    dfs(1, children, dp, K, MOD)
    return sum(dp[1][1:]) % MOD  # Sum all ways for the root node

def write_output(result):
    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

N, K, children = get_input()
result = solve(N, K, children)
write_output(result)
```

Explanation of changes:

1. We store the parent-child relationships in reverse, where `children[b]` contains the parents of `b`, which allows for a bottom-up calculation of the number of ways.

2. The `dfs` function is modified to compute, for each node, the number of ways to distribute carrots considering the restriction that each child must get more carrots than its parent.

3. The base case is when a node has no children (is a leaf node); in this case, it can have any number of carrots from 1 to `K`.

4. For the non-base case, we iterate over all possible carrot counts for the current node and calculate the product of sums of possibilities for each child node, where the child must get more carrots than the current count.

5. The final result for the root node (1) is the sum of all `dp[1][j]` where `j` ranges from 1 to `K`.

This corrected and optimized code should now provide the expected output of `9` for the given input data.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's carefully review the problem and fix the algorithm.

The previous attempts failed to accurately model the hierarchical constraints, specifically that each subordinate must have at least one more carrot than its superior. Let's revise the algorithm with a correct implementation of this constraint.

We will use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the hierarchy tree and calculate the number of ways to distribute the carrots, using dynamic programming to store the results for subproblems. For each node, we will calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots considering the maximum carrots (K) a node can have and ensuring subordinates always receive at least one more carrot than their superior.

Here is the revised solution, which should provide the correct output:

```python
MOD = 30011

def get_input(filename='iepuri.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        parents = [0] * (N + 1)
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            parents[b] = a
    return N, K, parents

def dfs(node, max_carrots, parents, dp):
    # Return memoized result if it exists
    if dp[node][max_carrots] != -1:
        return dp[node][max_carrots]

    # If the current node is a leaf (has no children), only 1 way to assign carrots
    if all(parents[child] != node for child in range(1, len(parents))):
        dp[node][max_carrots] = 1
        return 1

    # Otherwise, calculate ways considering the constraints
    ways = 1
    for child in range(1, len(parents)):
        if parents[child] == node:
            sub_ways = 0
            # Subordinates must have at least one more carrot than their superior
            for carrots in range(2, max_carrots + 1):
                sub_ways = (sub_ways + dfs(child, carrots, parents, dp)) % MOD
            ways = (ways * sub_ways) % MOD

    dp[node][max_carrots] = ways  # Memoize the result
    return ways

def solve(N, K, parents):
    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(K + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    answer = sum(dfs(1, carrots, parents, dp) for carrots in range(1, K + 1)) % MOD
    return answer

def write_output(result, filename='iepuri.out'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

N, K, parents = get_input()
result = solve(N, K, parents)
write_output(result)
```

In this solution:

- We use a 2D array `dp` to memoize the results of subproblems, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to distribute carrots to the subtree rooted at node `i`, with the constraint that node `i` can have at most `j` carrots.

- The `dfs` function is used to recursively calculate the number of ways to assign carrots to each node, given the hierarchical constraints.

- Finally, the result for the root node (which has an ID of 1) is summed over all possible carrot amounts from 1 to `K`, because the root node can have between 1 and `K` carrots.

- The answer is written to the `iepuri.out` file as expected.

This solution should now return the expected output of `9` for the provided input data.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results arises from a bug in the algorithm's implementation. The last solution incorrectly calculates the number of ways to assign carrots to subordinates, not considering the entire range of carrots that each subordinate can eat while having at least one more carrot than its parent. Let's revise and fix the solution to correctly address these constraints.

To solve this, we need to think of the problem as follows:
1. For each iepure (rabbit), compute the number of ways it can distribute carrots to its direct subordinates, given that it has `c` carrots.
2. To find the total number of ways, sum up the ways for the boss iepure, considering all possible carrot counts it can have (from 1 to K).
3. The number of ways an iepure can distribute `c` carrots to its direct subordinates is the product of the sums of the number of ways each subordinate can distribute `c - 1` carrots or fewer to their subordinates.

Let's implement the solution using dynamic programming with memoization:

```python
MOD = 30011

# Function to read input from file
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        subordinates = {i: [] for i in range(1, N + 1)}
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            subordinates[a].append(b)
    return N, K, subordinates

# Recursive function to calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots
# Memoization is used to avoid redundant calculations
def count_ways(node, carrots, subordinates, memo):
    if memo[node][carrots] != -1:
        return memo[node][carrots]
    if not subordinates[node]:  # If no subordinates, return 1 (base case)
        memo[node][carrots] = 1
    else:
        memo[node][carrots] = 1  # Initialize ways for this node
        # Calculate ways for each subordinate, considering the constraints
        for sub in subordinates[node]:
            ways_for_sub = 0
            # Subordinate must eat at least one more carrot than the current node
            for c in range(carrots + 1, K + 1):
                ways_for_sub = (ways_for_sub + count_ways(sub, c, subordinates, memo)) % MOD
            memo[node][carrots] = (memo[node][carrots] * ways_for_sub) % MOD
    return memo[node][carrots]

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve(N, K, subordinates):
    memo = [[-1 for _ in range(K + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    total_ways = sum(count_ways(1, c, subordinates, memo) for c in range(1, K + 1)) % MOD
    return total_ways

# Function to write output to file
def write_output(result, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

# Read input, solve the problem, and write output
N, K, subordinates = read_input('iepuri.in')
result = solve(N, K, subordinates)
write_output(result, 'iepuri.out')
```

This implementation defines a recursive function, `count_ways`, that calculates the number of ways to distribute carrots for a single node, given a specific number of carrots. The memoization table, `memo`, stores these results to avoid recalculating the same subproblems. The solution then sums the results for the boss iepure (node 1) with all possible carrot counts it can have.

Please replace the current code with this implementation, and the result should match the expected output.

I apologize for the confusion previously. Let's take a different approach and correct the solution.

We need to consider the dynamic programming approach where we calculate the number of ways each rabbit can distribute carrots to its subordinates given it has a specific number of carrots. To do this, we need to consider for each node, the ways it can assign carrots to its children based on how many carrots it can have, ranging from 1 to K.

Let's try another implementation:

```python
MOD = 30011

# Read input from 'iepuri.in'
with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    subordinates = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
        subordinates[a].append(b)

# Initialize dp array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to distribute
# j carrots to the i-th rabbit and its subordinates.
dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Recursive function to fill the dp array with the number of ways to distribute
# carrots to subordinates
def distribute(carrots, rabbit):
    if dp[rabbit][carrots] != 0:  # Return memoized value
        return dp[rabbit][carrots]

    ways = 1  # Initialize to 1 since the rabbit itself can eat one carrot
    for subordinate in subordinates[rabbit]:  # Iterate over subordinates of the rabbit
        sum_ways = 0
        for i in range(carrots + 1, K + 1):  # Subordinate must have more carrots
            sum_ways += distribute(i, subordinate)
            sum_ways %= MOD
        ways *= sum_ways
        ways %= MOD

    dp[rabbit][carrots] = ways
    return ways

# Calculate the number of ways for the chief rabbit (rabbit 1) to distribute
# carrots to all its subordinates
total_ways = 0
for i in range(1, K + 1):
    total_ways += distribute(i, 1)
    total_ways %= MOD

# Write output to 'iepuri.out'
with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_ways))
```

This solution uses a top-down dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots. We also use modulo operation to ensure we don't exceed the number limits.

Please run this updated code, and it should now give the correct output, which is expected to be `9` for the given input data.

I apologize for the ongoing issues with the previous solutions. Let's fix the issue by reevaluating the problem and finding a solution that correctly calculates the number of ways to distribute the carrots under the given constraints.

Each rabbit can eat between 1 and K carrots, and each rabbit must eat at least one carrot less than all of its subordinates. To compute the number of ways to distribute the carrots, we must consider all possible distributions for the rabbits starting from the ones at the bottom of the hierarchy.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
MOD = 30011

# Helper function to read input from file
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        subordinates = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            superior, subordinate = map(int, file.readline().split())
            subordinates[superior].append(subordinate)
    return N, K, subordinates

# Recursive function with memoization to compute distribution ways
def compute_ways(rabbit, K, subordinates, memo):
    if memo[rabbit][K] != -1:
        return memo[rabbit][K]

    # Base case: if there are no subordinates for this rabbit
    if not subordinates[rabbit]:
        # If rabbit can eat up to K carrots, there's only 1 way
        memo[rabbit][K] = 1
        return 1

    total_ways = 1
    for subordinate in subordinates[rabbit]:
        subordinate_ways = 0
        # The subordinate can eat between 1 and K-1 carrots (one less than the current rabbit)
        for carrots in range(1, K):
            subordinate_ways += compute_ways(subordinate, carrots, subordinates, memo)
            subordinate_ways %= MOD
        total_ways *= subordinate_ways
        total_ways %= MOD

    memo[rabbit][K] = total_ways
    return total_ways

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve(N, K, subordinates):
    # Initialize memoization array with -1
    memo = [[-1 for _ in range(K + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    # Compute the number of ways for the big boss (rabbit 1)
    answer = 0
    for carrots in range(1, K + 1):
        answer += compute_ways(1, carrots, subordinates, memo)
        answer %= MOD
    return answer

# Function to write output to file
def write_output(result, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

# Read input, solve the problem, and write output
N, K, subordinates = read_input('iepuri.in')
result = solve(N, K, subordinates)
write_output(result, 'iepuri.out')

This revised solution sets up the problem using the following approach:
- We create a memoization matrix `memo`, where `memo[rabbit][K]` keeps track of the number of ways rabbit `rabbit` can distribute exactly `K` carrots among itself and its subordinates.
- We run a recursive function `compute_ways`, which computes the total number of ways to distribute the carrots from the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, making sure to enforce the constraint that each rabbit must eat at least one carrot less than its subordinates.
- We accumulate the results for the big boss rabbit for all possible carrot values it can eat (from 1 to `K`).
- We write the final answer to the output file `iepuri.out`.

This implementation should now correctly compute the number of ways to distribute carrots and provide the expected output for the given input data.
