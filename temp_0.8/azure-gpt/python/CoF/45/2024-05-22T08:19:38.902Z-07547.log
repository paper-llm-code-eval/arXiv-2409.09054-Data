Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

    # Traverse all children of the current node
    for child in children[node]:

Upon reviewing the provided solution and comparing it with the expected output, it seems there might be an issue with the implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm. Since the results differ, let's go through the logic again to find and fix the issue.

The solution must calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots to the hierarchy of rabbits such that each rabbit eats at least one carrot and one less than each of its subordinates. The solution is dynamic programming on trees.

The discrepancy in the result could be due to the handling of the dynamic programming table or the DFS traversal. Let's correct the implementation:

```python
MOD = 30011

# Perform DFS and compute number of ways using dynamic programming
def dfs(v):
    global dp, children, K
    # Set the number of ways for the current node to 1 for each carrot count
    dp[v] = [1] * (K + 2)  # We use K + 2 to simplify indexing
    # Iterate over all children
    for u in children[v]:
        dfs(u)
        # Combine the number of ways with the child's number of ways
        for i in range(1, K + 1):  # Number of carrots for the current node
            ways_with_i_carrots = 0
            for j in range(i + 1, K + 2):  # Number of carrots for the child
                ways_with_i_carrots = (ways_with_i_carrots + dp[u][j]) % MOD
            dp[v][i] = (dp[v][i] * ways_with_i_carrots) % MOD

# Read from 'iepuri.in'
with open('iepuri.in') as file_in:
    N, K = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    children = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        a, b = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
        children[a].append(b)

# Initialize dynamic programming table
dp = [[0] * (K + 2) for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Perform DFS starting from node 1 (assuming 1 is the root)
dfs(1)

# Calculate the total number of ways considering carrots for node 1
result = sum(dp[1][1:K+1]) % MOD

# Write to 'iepuri.out'
with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This updated solution should now provide the correct number of ways to distribute the carrots, ensuring that the constraints of the problem are satisfied.

Upon further evaluation, it appears that the previous implementation still does not produce the correct result. To address this, let's revisit the algorithm and make sure it correctly computes the number of ways to distribute carrots while adhering to the problem's constraints.

Here's a revised version of the algorithm that captures the proper logic:

1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of ways for each node starting from the leaves up to the root.
2. For each node, initialize the number of ways to 1.
3. For each child node, calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots such that the child gets more carrots than the current node.
4. Combine the results for all children nodes to find the total number of ways for the current node.

Let's implement this algorithm correctly:

```python
MOD = 30011

def dfs(v):
    global dp, children, K
    # Initialize the number of ways for the current node to 1
    for carrots in range(K + 1):
        dp[v][carrots] = 1

    # Process children of the current node
    for u in children[v]:
        # Perform DFS for the child node
        dfs(u)
        # Update the number of ways for the current node based on the child node
        new_dp = [0] * (K + 1)
        for carrots_v in range(1, K + 1):
            # Calculate the sum of the number of ways for the child node to have more carrots
            sum_ways = 0
            for carrots_u in range(carrots_v + 1, K + 1):
                sum_ways = (sum_ways + dp[u][carrots_u]) % MOD
            new_dp[carrots_v] = (dp[v][carrots_v] * sum_ways) % MOD
        dp[v] = new_dp

# Read from 'iepuri.in'
with open('iepuri.in') as file_in:
    N, K = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    children = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    # Assuming node 1 is the root, find the actual root by checking which node has no parent
    has_parent = [False] * (N + 1)
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        a, b = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
        children[a].append(b)
        has_parent[b] = True
    # Find the root (the one with no parent)
    root = next(i for i in range(1, N + 1) if not has_parent[i])

# Initialize dynamic programming table
dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Perform DFS starting from the root
dfs(root)

# Calculate the total number of ways considering carrots for the root node
result = sum(dp[root][1:]) % MOD

# Write to 'iepuri.out'
with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This corrected solution should now provide the expected output of `9` for the given input. The key change is the corrected handling of the dynamic programming states, ensuring that each child has strictly more carrots than its parent. Additionally, it now properly identifies the root of the hierarchy, which doesn't necessarily have to be node 1.
