La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

Certainly! Below is the rewritten solution that reads from `concurs.in` and writes to `concurs.out` as specified in the challenge. The program does not use `input()` or `print()` and adheres to the constraints and requirements mentioned. 

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to write the result to 'concurs.out'
def write_result(counties, county_counts, output_list):
    with open("concurs.out", "w") as fout:
        fout.write(f"{len(counties)}\n")
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, county_counts)) + "\n")
        for county, student in output_list:
            fout.write(f"{county} {student}\n")

# Read the input data from 'concurs.in'
with open("concurs.in", "r") as fin:
    P = int(next(fin).strip())
    students = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(P):
        J, E = map(int, next(fin).split())
        students[J].append(E)

# Sort the students in each county and get the sorted list of county identifiers
sorted_students_per_county = {k: sorted(v) for k, v in students.items()}
counties = sorted(sorted_students_per_county.keys())
county_counts = [len(sorted_students_per_county[county]) for county in counties]

# Generate the required list for the organizers
output_list, county_indices = [], {county: 0 for county in counties}
while len(output_list) < P:
    for county in counties:
        if county_indices[county] < len(sorted_students_per_county[county]):
            output_list.append((county, sorted_students_per_county[county][county_indices[county]]))
            county_indices[county] += 1

# Write the output data to 'concurs.out'
write_result(counties, county_counts, output_list)
```

This script should be saved to a `.py` file and executed in an environment where the `concurs.in` file exists. It will read the input from that file, process the data according to the challenge rules, and then write the output to `concurs.out` as required.

The error in the provided solution was that it processed the counties strictly in ascending order of their identifiers, without ensuring that consecutive participants are from different counties. To fix this, we must ensure that we alternate between counties when selecting the next student.

Here's a revised solution that alternates between counties and meets all the challenge requirements:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

def write_result(counties, county_counts, output_list):
    with open("concurs.out", "w") as fout:
        fout.write(f"{len(counties)}\n")
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, county_counts)) + "\n")
        for county, student in output_list:
            fout.write(f"{county} {student}\n")

with open("concurs.in", "r") as fin:
    P = int(next(fin).strip())
    students = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(P):
        J, E = map(int, next(fin).split())
        students[J].append(E)

# Sort the students in each county
for county in students:
    students[county].sort()

# Prepare for alternating between counties
counties = sorted(students.keys())
county_counts = [len(students[county]) for county in counties]
available_counties = [(0, county) for county in counties]  # Heap of (index, county)
heapify(available_counties)

output_list = []
last_county = -1
while available_counties:
    # Get the county with the lowest index that is not the same as the last one
    index, county = heappop(available_counties)
    if county == last_county and available_counties:
        next_index, next_county = heappop(available_counties)
        heappush(available_counties, (index, county))
        index, county = next_index, next_county

    # Add the next student from this county to the output list
    student = students[county].pop(0)
    output_list.append((county, student))
    last_county = county

    # If there are more students in this county, add it back to the heap
    if students[county]:
        heappush(available_counties, (index + 1, county))

write_result(counties, county_counts, output_list)
```

This solution uses a min-heap (`available_counties`) to keep track of which counties have available students. It ensures that the next student chosen is not from the same county as the previous one unless no other counties have available students. This alternating approach guarantees that the output list will have students from different counties consecutively while still maintaining the order of student identifiers within each county.

The issue with the previous solutions is that they don't maintain the alternation between different counties for consecutive students. We must ensure that no two consecutive students are from the same county while also maintaining the internal order of students within each county.

To fix this issue, I will reimplement the solution using a different approach. The idea is to maintain a queue for each county containing its students in sorted order. We then cycle through the counties, taking one student at a time from each, and ensuring we do not take two consecutive students from the same county.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque
from itertools import cycle

# Read input data
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    students = {}
    for _ in range(P):
        J, E = map(int, file.readline().split())
        if J not in students:
            students[J] = []
        students[J].append(E)

# Sort students within each county
for county in students:
    students[county].sort()

# Create a queue for each county
queues = {county: deque(students[county]) for county in sorted(students)}

# Prepare output variables
output_list = []
last_county = None

# Cycle through counties, popping one student at a time
for county in cycle(queues):
    if queues[county] and county != last_county:
        student = queues[county].popleft()
        output_list.append((county, student))
        last_county = county
        if len(output_list) == P:
            break

# Write output data
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(queues)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(str(len(queues[county])) for county in sorted(queues)) + "\n")
    for county, student in output_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student}\n")
```

This solution uses `deque` from the `collections` module to efficiently pop students from the front of each county's queue. The `cycle` function from the `itertools` module is used to iterate over the counties in a round-robin fashion. The check `if queues[county] and county != last_county:` ensures that we only take a student from a county if it's not the last county we took a student from and if there are still students left in that county's queue. Once we have the required number of students in the `output_list` (which should be `P`), we break out of the loop. The `output_list` is then written to the 'concurs.out' file in the specified format.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system due to an out-of-memory condition or that it was forcibly killed (for example, using `kill -9` on a Unix-like system). Since there is no output in either stdout or stderr, it suggests that the program did not encounter a typical runtime error, but rather a system-level interruption.

The cycling solution could potentially get stuck in an infinite loop if, at any point, the only remaining students are from the same county as the last selected student. To handle this, we need to ensure that the cycle terminates correctly when no more students can be chosen according to the rules.

Here's an adjusted solution that avoids infinite loops:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read input data
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    county_students = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(P):
        J, E = map(int, file.readline().split())
        county_students[J].append(E)

# Sort students within each county and convert to deque
for county in county_students:
    county_students[county].sort()
    county_students[county] = deque(county_students[county])

# Prepare for round-robin selection
counties = sorted(county_students)
county_indices = cycle(counties)  # To cycle through counties
output_list = []
used_counties = set()  # To track which counties were used in the current round

# Select students ensuring no two consecutive are from the same county
while len(output_list) < P:
    county = next(county_indices)
    
    # Skip if this county was already used in the current cycle
    if county in used_counties:
        continue
    
    if county_students[county]:
        student = county_students[county].popleft()
        output_list.append((county, student))
        used_counties.add(county)
    
    # If we've used all available counties, reset the used counties set
    if len(used_counties) == len(counties):
        used_counties.clear()
    
    # Terminate if we cannot select any more students
    if not any(county_students.values()):
        break

# Write output data
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(counties)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(str(len(county_students[county])) for county in counties) + "\n")
    for county, student in output_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student}\n")
```

In this solution, `used_counties` keeps track of counties that have already had a student selected in the current cycle of counties. Once every county has been used, the set is reset, allowing for another round of selections. This prevents the infinite loop issue by breaking out of the loop if there are no more students to select.

This code should function correctly as long as there are students from at least two different counties. Given the problem statement, it is guaranteed that there is a solution, so there must be participants from at least two different counties.

The error message indicates a `NameError`, which means that the `cycle` name is not defined. This is likely because I forgot to import the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module. To fix this, we should add the appropriate import statement at the beginning of the code.

Here is the corrected solution with the necessary import statement:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from itertools import cycle

# Read input data
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    county_students = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(P):
        J, E = map(int, file.readline().split())
        county_students[J].append(E)

# Sort students within each county and convert to deque
for county in county_students:
    county_students[county].sort()
    county_students[county] = deque(county_students[county])

# Prepare for round-robin selection
counties = sorted(county_students)
county_indices = cycle(counties)  # To cycle through counties
output_list = []
used_counties = set()  # To track which counties were used in the current round

# Select students ensuring no two consecutive are from the same county
while len(output_list) < P:
    county = next(county_indices)
    
    # Skip if this county was already used in the current cycle
    if county in used_counties:
        continue
    
    if county_students[county]:
        student = county_students[county].popleft()
        output_list.append((county, student))
        used_counties.add(county)
    
    # If we've used all available counties, reset the used counties set
    if len(used_counties) == len(counties):
        used_counties.clear()
    
    # Terminate if we cannot select any more students
    if not any(county_students.values()):
        break

# Write output data
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(counties)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(str(len(county_students[county])) for county in counties) + "\n")
    for county, student in output_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student}\n")
```

This code should now work correctly as it includes the required import. It reads from 'concurs.in', processes the students according to the constraints, and writes the result to 'concurs.out'.

The exit code 137 suggests that the program was terminated because it ran out of memory or was killed by the system. Given that there is no output in stderr, it likely ran into an infinite loop again, causing the system to terminate the process after it consumed too much CPU time or resources.

The previous solution attempted to use a cycling approach with keeping track of counties already used in a cycle. However, there was a logical mistake in resetting the `used_counties` set, which would cause the cycle to repeat indefinitely if the last county had no more students to select.

We need to adjust the logic to ensure that we exit the while loop correctly when no more valid selections are possible. Here's the updated solution that guarantees termination:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input data
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    county_students = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(P):
        J, E = map(int, file.readline().split())
        county_students[J].append(E)

# Sort the students in each county
for county in county_students:
    county_students[county].sort()

# Prepare output variables
counties = list(sorted(county_students.keys()))
output_list = []
last_county = 0

# Function to find the next county to select a student from
def next_county_index(last_index, counties, county_students):
    for i in range(len(counties)):
        index = (last_index + 1 + i) % len(counties)
        if county_students[counties[index]]:
            return index
    return None

# Select students ensuring no two consecutive are from the same county
current_index = -1
while len(output_list) < P:
    current_index = next_county_index(current_index, counties, county_students)
    if current_index is None:  # No more students available from a different county
        break
    county = counties[current_index]
    student = county_students[county].pop(0)
    output_list.append((county, student))
    last_county = county

# Write output data
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(counties)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(str(len(county_students[county])) for county in sorted(county_students)) + "\n")
    for county, student in output_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student}\n")
```

This solution uses a `next_county_index` function to find the next county with available students, ensuring that it is different from the last county we picked a student from. This approach ensures that we do not get stuck in an infinite loop because the function returns `None` when it is not possible to find a valid next county, allowing us to break out of the while loop. The students are then written to 'concurs.out' according to the competition requirements.
