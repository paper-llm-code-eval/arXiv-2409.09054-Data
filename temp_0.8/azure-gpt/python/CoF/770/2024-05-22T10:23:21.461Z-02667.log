La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read from input file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]

# Sort participants by county and id
participants.sort()

# Create a list to store county IDs and their participant counts
county_ids = defaultdict(int)
for county_id, _ in participants:
    county_ids[county_id] += 1

# Sort counties by ID and create output lists
sorted_county_ids = sorted(county_ids.keys())
county_counts = [county_ids[county_id] for county_id in sorted_county_ids]

# Initialize pointers for the counties and prepare list for ordered participants
pointers = {county_id: 0 for county_id in sorted_county_ids}
ordered_participants = []

# Algorithm to order participants according to the conditions
last_county_id = -1
while len(ordered_participants) < P:
    for county_id in sorted_county_ids:
        if pointers[county_id] < county_ids[county_id] and county_id != last_county_id:
            index = pointers[county_id]
            participant = next((p for p in participants if p[0] == county_id and p[1] > index), None)
            if participant:
                ordered_participants.append(participant)
                pointers[county_id] = participant[1]
                last_county_id = county_id
                break

# Write to output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(sorted_county_ids)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, county_counts)) + '\n')
    for participant in ordered_participants:
        file.write(f"{participant[0]} {participant[1]}\n")
```
This code reads from 'concurs.in', processes the participants, and writes the required output to 'concurs.out'. The participants are first sorted by their county ID and their personal ID. Then, the code creates an ordered list of participants, ensuring that no two consecutive participants come from the same county and that they are ordered by their personal IDs within their particular county. Finally, the output with the number of counties, the list of participant counts per county, and the ordered list of participants is written to 'concurs.out'.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was forcibly killed, usually due to running out of memory or being terminated by an external command (like a SIGKILL signal). In this case, because the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) do not provide any specific error message, it's hard to determine the exact cause of the issue.

However, given the constraints of the problem (up to 500 participants and up to 50 counties), it is unlikely that memory constraints are the issue. More probable causes could be an infinite loop in the algorithm or some environment limitation that the code encountered when running.

Based on the challenge description and the code provided, one potential issue that could cause an infinite loop is in the part of the algorithm that orders participants. If there is a situation where no valid "next participant" can be found (due to the last county ID check), the loop may run indefinitely.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the loop will always terminate after all participants are processed. To facilitate this, we can maintain a list of counts of participants for each county and use this to iterate over participants in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that we only look at counties that still have participants left to process.

Let's rewrite the solution and fix the loop:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read from input file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]

# Sort participants by county and id
participants.sort()

# Create a defaultdict to hold lists of participants for each county
county_lists = defaultdict(list)
for county_id, participant_id in participants:
    county_lists[county_id].append(participant_id)

# Create the output list of participants
ordered_participants = []
# Use round-robin to select participants from different counties
while len(ordered_participants) < P:
    for county_id in sorted(county_lists.keys()):
        if county_lists[county_id]:
            participant_id = county_lists[county_id].pop(0)
            ordered_participants.append((county_id, participant_id))

# Write to output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of counties
    file.write(f"{len(county_lists)}\n")
    # Write the number of participants from each county, sorted by county ID
    for county_id in sorted(county_lists.keys()):
        file.write(f"{len(county_lists[county_id])} ")
    file.write("\n")
    # Write the ordered list of participants
    for county_id, participant_id in ordered_participants:
        file.write(f"{county_id} {participant_id}\n")
```

This rewritten solution should handle the participant ordering correctly and avoid any infinite loops, ensuring that the process completes and writes the correct output to the 'concurs.out' file.

The found output differs from the expected output due to a bug in the code that writes the number of participants from each county. The code snippet:

```python
for county_id in sorted(county_lists.keys()):
    file.write(f"{len(county_lists[county_id])} ")
```

is writing `0` for each county because it is executed after the main loop that removes participants from `county_lists`. Therefore, by the time it writes the counts, all lists are empty, resulting in `0` for each county.

We need to store the number of participants from each county before we modify `county_lists` within the while loop.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `ordered_participants` list respects the condition that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. The current round-robin approach does not guarantee that.

Let's fix the code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read from input file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]

# Sort participants by county and id
participants.sort()

# Create a defaultdict to hold lists of participants for each county
county_lists = defaultdict(list)
for county_id, participant_id in participants:
    county_lists[county_id].append(participant_id)

# Store the number of participants from each county before modifying the lists
county_counts = {county_id: len(ids) for county_id, ids in county_lists.items()}

# Create the output list of participants respecting that consecutive participants
# are from different counties
ordered_participants = []
last_county_id = -1
while len(ordered_participants) < P:
    for county_id in sorted(county_lists.keys()):
        # Avoid consecutive participants from the same county
        if county_id == last_county_id or not county_lists[county_id]:
            continue
        participant_id = county_lists[county_id].pop(0)
        ordered_participants.append((county_id, participant_id))
        last_county_id = county_id

# Write to output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of counties
    file.write(f"{len(county_counts)}\n")
    # Write the number of participants from each county, sorted by county ID
    for county_id in sorted(county_counts.keys()):
        file.write(f"{county_counts[county_id]} ")
    file.write("\n")
    # Write the ordered list of participants
    for county_id, participant_id in ordered_participants:
        file.write(f"{county_id} {participant_id}\n")
```

This corrected solution now correctly writes the number of participants for each county before emptying the `county_lists` and correctly orders participants as per the problem statement's requirements (ensuring that no two consecutive participants are from the same county).

Exit code 137 typically means that the process was killed by a signal such as SIGKILL, which can happen when the program is consuming too much memory or taking too long. Since we have no output in either stdout or stderr, the problem might be due to an infinite loop in the code.

The most likely place for an infinite loop to occur in the previous code is within the while loop that generates `ordered_participants`. If at any point there are still participants to be placed in the list, but none can be placed because they all belong to the same last county, the loop will never terminate.

To address this, we need a more robust round-robin approach that ensures we always pick participants from a different county than the last one, and we can skip counties that have been used until we find an eligible one. We also need to ensure that once we've used all participants from a county, we no longer consider that county.

Let's rewrite the solution with these fixes:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read from input file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]

# Sort participants by county and id
participants.sort()

# Create a defaultdict to hold queues of participants for each county
county_queues = defaultdict(deque)
for county_id, participant_id in participants:
    county_queues[county_id].append(participant_id)

# Store the number of participants from each county before modifying the queues
county_counts = {county_id: len(ids) for county_id, ids in county_queues.items()}

# Create the output list of participants respecting that consecutive participants
# are from different counties
ordered_participants = []
last_county_id = -1
remaining_counties = deque(sorted(county_queues.keys()))  # Maintain a list of remaining counties

while remaining_counties and len(ordered_participants) < P:
    # Use round-robin over the remaining counties
    county_id = remaining_counties.popleft()
    # Skip if we just placed a participant from this county
    if county_id == last_county_id:
        remaining_counties.append(county_id)
        continue
    # Place the next participant from this county
    participant_id = county_queues[county_id].popleft()
    ordered_participants.append((county_id, participant_id))
    last_county_id = county_id
    # If the county still has participants, put it back in the list
    if county_queues[county_id]:
        remaining_counties.append(county_id)

# Write to output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of counties
    file.write(f"{len(county_counts)}\n")
    # Write the number of participants from each county, sorted by county ID
    for county_id in sorted(county_counts.keys()):
        file.write(f"{county_counts[county_id]} ")
    file.write("\n")
    # Write the ordered list of participants
    for county_id, participant_id in ordered_participants:
        file.write(f"{county_id} {participant_id}\n")
```

This solution now cycles through the counties in a round-robin fashion using a deque, ensuring that once a participant from a county is placed, we do not consider that county again until all other counties have had a chance to place a participant. This approach should eliminate the possibility of an infinite loop and allow the program to exit correctly.

Exit code 137 suggests that the process was killed, likely due to it running too long or consuming too much memory. In the context of a programming challenge, this is often a sign of an infinite loop or a section of code that is not performing as expected.

Given that the standard output and standard error are empty, there are no explicit error messages to guide us, and we have to infer what might be going wrong from the code itself. The previous implementation tries to use a round-robin approach with a deque to rotate through the counties. However, if there is a situation where the last county is the only one left with participants and it is also the last county used, the code would enter an infinite loop, constantly skipping the last county and never exiting the while loop.

We need to ensure the algorithm doesn't get stuck in such a situation. We can do this by using a set to keep track of the counties that have remaining participants and only cycling through those. We must also ensure that we do not select participants consecutively from the same county.

I'll rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read from input file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]

# Sort participants by county and id
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county
county_to_participants = defaultdict(list)
for county_id, participant_id in participants:
    county_to_participants[county_id].append(participant_id)

# Determine the distinct county IDs, sorted
distinct_counties = sorted(county_to_participants.keys())

# Write to output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of distinct counties
    file.write(f"{len(distinct_counties)}\n")
    # Write the number of participants from each county
    file.write(' '.join(str(len(county_to_participants[county])) for county in distinct_counties) + '\n')
    
    # Initialize a variable to store the last used county
    last_county_id = None
    # Loop until we've placed all participants
    while participants:
        for county_id in distinct_counties:
            # If this county is not the last used and has participants left
            if county_id != last_county_id and county_to_participants[county_id]:
                # Select the next participant from this county
                participant_id = county_to_participants[county_id].pop(0)
                # Write the participant's county and ID to file
                file.write(f"{county_id} {participant_id}\n")
                # Update the last used county
                last_county_id = county_id
                # Break the inner loop to move on to the next participant
                break
        else:
            # If we didn't place any participant, we need to reset the last_county_id
            last_county_id = None
```

In this version, we rotate through the counties in a fixed order, placing one participant each time and skipping the last used county. Once we place a participant from a county, we mark it as the last used. If we can't place any participants in a full cycle (i.e., the `else` clause of the `for` loop is reached), it means that we are left with participants from only one county, so we reset `last_county_id` to allow placing these remaining participants. This way, we ensure that we don't get stuck in an infinite loop.

I apologize for the confusion. Given the strict constraints of the problem and the lack of error messages, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact issue that's causing the program to exit with code 137 without the ability to run and debug the code directly. However, based on the problem statement and previous attempts, it's clear that we need to construct an algorithm that ensures we avoid any infinite loops and that the process completes successfully within the resource constraints.

To fix this, let's focus on a new algorithm that guarantees termination. We'll maintain a list of participants for each county, but this time we'll be more careful about how we select the next participant to ensure that we do not repeat the last selected county unless necessary.

Here's the updated solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def write_ordered_participants(participants_by_county, county_ids, file):
    last_county_id = -1  # Initialize with an invalid county id
    while any(participants_by_county.values()):  # While there are still participants
        for county_id in county_ids:
            # Skip if this county has no participants left or was the last one used
            if not participants_by_county[county_id] or county_id == last_county_id:
                continue
            # Get the next participant for the county
            next_participant_id = participants_by_county[county_id].pop(0)
            # Write the participant's county and ID to the file
            file.write(f"{county_id} {next_participant_id}\n")
            # Update the last used county id
            last_county_id = county_id
            break  # Break after writing one participant to ensure alternating counties

# Read from input file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(P)]

# Sort participants by county and id
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county
participants_by_county = defaultdict(list)
for county_id, participant_id in participants:
    participants_by_county[county_id].append(participant_id)

# Determine the distinct county IDs, sorted
county_ids = sorted(participants_by_county.keys())

# Write to output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of distinct counties
    file.write(f"{len(county_ids)}\n")
    # Write the number of participants from each county
    file.write(' '.join(str(len(participants_by_county[county])) for county in county_ids) + '\n')
    
    # Write the ordered list of participants
    write_ordered_participants(participants_by_county, county_ids, file)
```

In this solution, we ensure that each county is only revisited after an attempt to place a participant from a different county. We guarantee that the loop will terminate by checking if there are any participants left in any county. If there is only one county left with participants, they will still be placed since the check for `last_county_id` will not prevent it. This approach should avoid infinite loops and complete correctly within the constraints of the problem.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output arises from the order in which participants are selected from each county. The algorithm should ensure that participants from the same county are not placed consecutively unless no other option is available. The current solution fails to do this because it doesn't handle the case when participants from a county are written consecutively due to the exhaustion of participants in all other counties.

To address this, the algorithm must be re-implemented to ensure that participants from the same county are not selected consecutively. Let's correct the output:

```python
# Utilize defaultdict to create the data structure to hold participants by county
from collections import defaultdict

# First, read the participants from the 'concurs.in' file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(P):
        county_id, participant_id = map(int, file.readline().split())
        participants[county_id].append(participant_id)

# Sort participants within each county
for county_id in participants:
    participants[county_id].sort()

# Write the output to 'concurs.out'
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    # First, write the number of distinct counties
    distinct_counties = sorted(participants.keys())
    file.write(f"{len(distinct_counties)}\n")
    
    # Then, write the number of participants from each county in ascending order of county IDs
    num_participants = [len(participants[county_id]) for county_id in distinct_counties]
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, num_participants)) + '\n')

    # Initialize last written county_id to None
    last_county_id = None

    # Loop until we have written all participants
    while P > 0:
        for county_id in distinct_counties:
            if participants[county_id] and county_id != last_county_id:
                # Write the next participant of this county
                file.write(f"{county_id} {participants[county_id].pop(0)}\n")
                last_county_id = county_id
                P -= 1
                break  # Once we've written a participant, break to the next iteration
            elif not participants[county_id]:
                # If a county has no more participants, remove it from the list
                distinct_counties.remove(county_id)
            # If last_county_id is the only county left, reset it so we can write participants from it
            if len(distinct_counties) == 1 and participants[distinct_counties[0]]:
                last_county_id = None
```

This code should correctly output the participants such that no two consecutive participants are from the same county, unless all remaining participants are from the same county. The county list is dynamically adjusted to remove counties with no remaining participants, and a check is added to reset `last_county_id` if we are down to a single county with remaining participants. This should match the expected output.
