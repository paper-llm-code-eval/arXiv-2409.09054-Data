La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't properly alternate between the counties when selecting the next student. It only checks if the current county is different from the last, but this can lead to a sequence where two counties alternate back and forth without including others, as seen in the "Found output".

To fix this, we need to implement a way to remember the last county used and ensure that we pick a student from a different county each time until we have used all available counties, and then repeat the process.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Code to be written in a markdown code block

# Read from file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as infile:
    P = int(infile.readline().strip())
    participants = []
    for _ in range(P):
        county_id, student_id = map(int, infile.readline().split())
        participants.append((county_id, student_id))

# Sort participants by county and then by student ID
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county
county_groups = {}
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    if county_id not in county_groups:
        county_groups[county_id] = []
    county_groups[county_id].append(student_id)

# Prepare the list and counters for the counties and students
county_order = sorted(county_groups.keys())
county_student_counters = {k: 0 for k in county_order}
output = []

# Start with the first county and get the first student
current_county_index = -1

# Loop until we have placed all students
while len(output) < P:
    current_county_index = (current_county_index + 1) % len(county_order)
    county_id = county_order[current_county_index]
    student_id = county_groups[county_id][county_student_counters[county_id]]
    output.append((county_id, student_id))
    county_student_counters[county_id] += 1
    # If we've placed all students from a county, remove it from the rotation
    if county_student_counters[county_id] >= len(county_groups[county_id]):
        county_order.pop(current_county_index)
        current_county_index -= 1  # Adjust index since we removed an item

# Write to file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{len(county_groups)}\n")
    outfile.write(' '.join(str(len(county_groups[county])) for county in sorted(county_groups.keys())) + '\n')
    for county_id, student_id in output:
        outfile.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")
```

This revised solution should now correctly alternate between the counties, while ensuring that we use all available counties before repeating any, as required by the problem statement. It also handles the case where a county runs out of students by removing it from the rotation.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't ensure that the counties alternate in the order required by the problem statement. The expected behavior is to add one student from each county in a round-robin fashion, and if a county runs out of students, it should be skipped in the sequence.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as infile:
    P = int(next(infile))
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile]

# Sort participants by county and then by student ID
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county
county_groups = {}
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    county_groups.setdefault(county_id, []).append(student_id)

# Prepare variables for tracking counties and students
county_ids = sorted(county_groups.keys())
county_counts = {county_id: len(students) for county_id, students in county_groups.items()}
output = []

# Generator function to yield next student in a round-robin across counties
def next_student():
    county_index = 0
    student_indices = {county_id: 0 for county_id in county_ids}
    while sum(county_counts.values()) > 0:
        county_id = county_ids[county_index]
        if student_indices[county_id] < county_counts[county_id]:
            student_id = county_groups[county_id][student_indices[county_id]]
            student_indices[county_id] += 1
            yield county_id, student_id
            if student_indices[county_id] == county_counts[county_id]:
                county_counts[county_id] = 0
        county_index = (county_index + 1) % len(county_ids)

# Collect the ordered list of students
for student in next_student():
    output.append(student)

# Write output to file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{len(county_ids)}\n")
    outfile.write(' '.join(str(county_counts_original[county_id]) for county_id in county_ids) + '\n')
    for county_id, student_id in output:
        outfile.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution introduces a generator function `next_student()` that yields students in the correct round-robin order. It tracks the indices of students for each county and skips counties that have no remaining students. The outer loop continues until all students are placed in the output. The solution ensures that counties are visited in a round-robin manner, and students within a county are listed in ascending order, as required.

The error message indicates that the variable `county_counts_original` is not defined. This means that when trying to write the number of participants from each county to the file, the program is referencing a variable that doesn't exist. To fix the error, we should use the already defined `county_counts` variable for writing the output, not `county_counts_original`.

Let's correct the solution and make sure to properly refer to existing variables:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as infile:
    P = int(next(infile))
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile]

# Sort participants by county and then by student ID
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county
county_groups = {}
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    county_groups.setdefault(county_id, []).append(student_id)

# Prepare variables for tracking counties and students
county_ids = sorted(county_groups.keys())
county_counts = {county_id: len(students) for county_id, students in county_groups.items()}
output = []

# Generator function to yield next student in a round-robin across counties
def next_student():
    county_index = 0
    student_indices = {county_id: 0 for county_id in county_ids}
    while sum(county_counts.values()) > 0:
        county_id = county_ids[county_index]
        if student_indices[county_id] < county_counts[county_id]:
            student_id = county_groups[county_id][student_indices[county_id]]
            student_indices[county_id] += 1
            yield county_id, student_id
            if student_indices[county_id] == county_counts[county_id]:
                county_counts[county_id] = 0
        county_index = (county_index + 1) % len(county_ids)

# Collect the ordered list of students
for student in next_student():
    output.append(student)

# Write output to file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{len(county_ids)}\n")
    # Fix: use the correct variable 'county_counts' instead of the undefined 'county_counts_original'
    outfile.write(' '.join(str(county_counts[county_id]) for county_id in county_ids) + '\n')
    for county_id, student_id in output:
        outfile.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")
```

This corrected solution uses the `county_counts` dictionary which contains the initial number of students from each county. It is used when writing the output to ensure that we print the number of participants from each county in ascending order of the county ID. The rest of the solution remains unchanged, as the logic for ordering students is correct.

The issue with the previous code is that it incorrectly updates the `county_counts` variable to zero after all students from a county have been yielded. This results in incorrect output for the number of participants from each county, as seen in the "Found output". We should use a separate variable to keep track of the original counts for writing to the output file.

Let's fix the code by introducing a new variable to store the original counts and use that for the output. Additionally, we need to ensure that we rotate between counties correctly, only moving to the next available county when we've placed a student from the current county. Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as infile:
    P = int(next(infile))
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile]

# Sort participants by county and then by student ID
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county
county_groups = {}
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    county_groups.setdefault(county_id, []).append(student_id)

# Prepare variables for tracking counties and students
county_ids = sorted(county_groups.keys())
original_county_counts = {county_id: len(students) for county_id, students in county_groups.items()}
output = []

# Create iterators for each group
county_iterators = {county_id: iter(students) for county_id, students in county_groups.items()}

# Generator function to yield next student in a round-robin across counties
def next_student():
    available_counties = county_ids[:]
    while available_counties:
        for county_id in available_counties[:]:  # Iterate over a copy of the list
            try:
                student_id = next(county_iterators[county_id])
                yield county_id, student_id
            except StopIteration:
                available_counties.remove(county_id)

# Collect the ordered list of students
for student in next_student():
    output.append(student)

# Write output to file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{len(county_ids)}\n")
    outfile.write(' '.join(str(original_county_counts[county_id]) for county_id in county_ids) + '\n')
    for county_id, student_id in output:
        outfile.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution uses the `original_county_counts` to keep track of the number of students originally in each county, and it's used only for writing to the output file. The `next_student` generator is now a function that keeps yielding the next student from available counties, and counties are removed from the available list when they run out of students. This way, we maintain a proper round-robin order and don't count students more than once.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. The error in the previous solutions is that we are not alternating between counties properly when generating the list of students. We need to ensure that the alternation happens between different counties in such a way that once a student from a county is picked, the next student must come from a different county until all counties are exhausted, at which point the cycle repeats.

The expected output suggests that after a student from a county is listed, the next student must come from the next county with remaining students (in sorted order of counties).

Here's a revised solution that should meet the expected output:

```python
# Code to be written in a markdown code block

# Read data from file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as infile:
    P = int(next(infile))
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile]

# Sort participants by county and then by student ID
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county
county_groups = {}
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    county_groups.setdefault(county_id, []).append(student_id)

# Prepare variables for tracking counties and students
county_ids = sorted(county_groups.keys())
county_counts = {county_id: len(students) for county_id, students in county_groups.items()}
original_county_counts = county_counts.copy()
output = []

# Start from the first county and find the next student from a different county
last_county_id = -1  # Variable to keep track of the last county used

# Loop until we have placed all students
while len(output) < P:
    for county_id in county_ids:
        if county_counts[county_id] > 0 and county_id != last_county_id:
            student_id = county_groups[county_id].pop(0)
            output.append((county_id, student_id))
            county_counts[county_id] -= 1
            last_county_id = county_id
            break

# Write output to file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{len(county_ids)}\n")
    outfile.write(' '.join(str(original_county_counts[county_id]) for county_id in county_ids) + '\n')
    for county_id, student_id in output:
        outfile.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution loops until all students are placed in the output list and ensures that we pick a student from a different county than the last one used. It uses a `last_county_id` variable to keep track of the last used county and alternates to the next available county with remaining students. The `original_county_counts` dictionary holds the original number of students per county for output, and it is not modified during the generation of the student list.

The issue in the previous attempts is misunderstanding the alternation logic. We should alternate between counties, yet ensure that each student within a county is listed in order before moving to the next student in another county. A correct approach is to loop through the counties in order, and for each county, pick the next student if available, ensuring that no two consecutive students are from the same county.

Let's implement a solution that correctly alternates between counties and respects the order of student IDs within each county:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as infile:
    P = int(next(infile))
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile]

# Sort participants by county and then by student ID
participants.sort()

# Group participants by county and sort the students within each county
county_groups = {}
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    county_groups.setdefault(county_id, []).append(student_id)

# Prepare variables for tracking counties and students
county_ids = sorted(county_groups.keys())
county_student_index = {county_id: 0 for county_id in county_ids}  # Index of the next student for each county

# Generate the list of students in the required order
output = []
last_county_used = -1
while len(output) < P:
    for county_id in county_ids:
        # Check if there is a next student and that the county is different from the last one used
        if county_student_index[county_id] < len(county_groups[county_id]) and county_id != last_county_used:
            student_id = county_groups[county_id][county_student_index[county_id]]
            output.append((county_id, student_id))
            county_student_index[county_id] += 1      # Move to the next student in this county
            last_county_used = county_id              # Update the last county used
            break  # Break here to start checking the next student from the first county again

# Write output to file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{len(county_ids)}\n")  # Number of different counties
    outfile.write(' '.join(str(len(county_groups[county_id])) for county_id in county_ids) + '\n')
    for county_id, student_id in output:
        outfile.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")
