În ultima ecranizare a celebrei piese shakespeariene Romeo şi Julieta trăiesc într-un oraş modern, comunică prin e-mail şi chiar învaţă să programeze. Într-o secvenţă tulburătoare sunt prezentate frământările interioare ale celor doi eroi încercând fără succes să scrie un program care să determine un punct optim de întâlnire. 

Ei au analizat harta oraşului şi au reprezentat-o sub forma unei matrice cu $n$ linii şi $m$ coloane, în matrice fiind marcate cu spaţiu zonele prin care se poate trece (străzi lipsite de pericole) şi cu `X` zonele prin care nu se poate trece. De asemenea, în matrice au marcat cu `R` locul în care se află locuinţa lui Romeo, iar cu `J` locul în care se află locuinţa Julietei. 

Ei se pot deplasa numai prin zonele care sunt marcate cu spaţiu, din poziţia curentă în oricare dintre cele 8 poziţii învecinate (pe orizontală, verticală sau diagonale).

Cum lui Romeo nu îi place să aştepte şi nici să se lase aşteptat n-ar fi tocmai bine, ei au hotărât că trebuie să aleagă un punct de întâlnire în care atât Romeo, cât şi Julieta să poată ajunge în acelaşi timp, plecând de acasă. Fiindcă la întâlniri amândoi vin într-un suflet, ei estimează timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la întâlnire prin numărul de elemente din matrice care constituie drumul cel mai scurt de acasă până la punctul de întâlnire. Şi cum probabil există mai multe puncte de întâlnire posibile, ei vor să îl aleagă pe cel în care timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la punctul de întâlnire este minim.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine o poziţie pe hartă la care Romeo şi Julieta pot să ajungă în acelaşi timp. Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul trebuie să determine o soluţie pentru care timpul este minim.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `rj.in` conţine:
* pe prima linie numerele naturale `N M`, care reprezintă numărul de linii şi respectiv de coloane ale matricei, separate prin spaţiu;
* pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află $M$ caractere (care pot fi doar `R`, `J`, `X` sau spaţiu) reprezentând matricea.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `rj.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care sunt scrise trei numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu `tmin x y`, având semnificaţia:
* `x y` reprezinţă punctul de întâlnire ($x$ – numărul liniei, $y$ – numărul coloanei);
* `tmin` este timpul minim în care Romeo (respectiv Julieta) ajunge la punctul de întâlnire.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N, M \leq 100$;
* Liniile şi coloanele matricei sunt numerotate începând cu 1.
* Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# RJ Challenge Solution

from collections import deque

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m):
    tmin = float('inf')
    x = y = -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if r_distances[i][j] == j_distances[i][j] and r_distances[i][j] < tmin:
                tmin = r_distances[i][j]
                x, y = i + 1, j + 1
    return tmin, x, y

# Read from rj.in
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Find Romeo and Juliet's locations and mark them as spaces
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '

# Compute distances from Romeo and Juliet's homes to all points
r_distances = bfs(matrix, r_start, n, m)
j_distances = bfs(matrix, j_start, n, m)

# Determine the optimal meeting point
tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m)

# Write to rj.out
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")
```

This solution uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate the shortest path from both Romeo's and Juliet's homes to every possible meeting point on the map. After that, it iterates through all the points to find the one where they can meet in the shortest amount of time, and that is at the same distance from both of them. It then writes the result to the output file `rj.out`. The BFS function computes distances of all reachable points from a given start point (Romeo or Juliet's home), and the `find_meeting_point` function finds the optimal point with the minimum time required for both to arrive simultaneously.

It seems the IndexError is due to an incorrect access of the matrix indices. Let's correct the code by ensuring that we have the correct bounds when searching for Romeo and Juliet's starting positions. Here is the revised and fixed solution:

```python
# RJ Challenge Solution

from collections import deque

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m):
    tmin = float('inf')
    x = y = -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if r_distances[i][j] != float('inf') and r_distances[i][j] == j_distances[i][j] and r_distances[i][j] < tmin:
                tmin = r_distances[i][j]
                x, y = i + 1, j + 1
    return tmin, x, y

# Read from rj.in
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Find Romeo and Juliet's locations and mark them as spaces
r_start = j_start = None
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '
        if r_start and j_start:
            break
    if r_start and j_start:
        break

# Compute distances from Romeo and Juliet's homes to all points
r_distances = bfs(matrix, r_start, n, m)
j_distances = bfs(matrix, j_start, n, m)

# Determine the optimal meeting point
tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m)

# Write to rj.out
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")
```

The revised solution adds checks to break out of the loops once both Romeo and Juliet's starting positions are found. This prevents the loops from going out of bounds of the matrix. Also, the solution checks that the distances from both Romeo and Juliet's starting points to a potential meeting point are not infinity before comparing them. This ensures that only reachable points are considered as valid meeting points.

It seems that the error persists due to accessing the matrix incorrectly. Let's address the issue by making sure we don't access the matrix beyond its bounds. Here's the revised code with the necessary fixes applied:

```python
# RJ Challenge Solution

from collections import deque

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m):
    tmin = float('inf')
    x = y = -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if r_distances[i][j] != float('inf') and j_distances[i][j] != float('inf') and r_distances[i][j] == j_distances[i][j]:
                if r_distances[i][j] < tmin:
                    tmin = r_distances[i][j]
                    x, y = i + 1, j + 1
    return tmin, x, y

# Read from rj.in
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Find Romeo and Juliet's locations
r_start = j_start = None
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '  # Mark the start position as space
        if matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '  # Mark the start position as space
        if r_start and j_start:
            break
    if r_start and j_start:
        break

# Compute distances from Romeo and Juliet's homes to all points
r_distances = bfs(matrix, r_start, n, m)
j_distances = bfs(matrix, j_start, n, m)

# Determine the optimal meeting point
tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m)

# Write to rj.out
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, we additionally ensure that the start positions (`r_start` and `j_start`) are found before attempting to access their indices in the matrix. Once found, we exit the nested loops immediately to avoid any unnecessary iteration that could lead to an index error. Additionally, we ensure that both `r_distances` and `j_distances` are not infinity before comparing them to find the meeting point.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. It appears there is still an out-of-range error occurring. I'll provide a corrected version of the solution, ensuring that we correctly iterate over the matrix and avoid any out-of-range errors:

```python
# RJ Challenge Solution

from collections import deque

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m):
    tmin = float('inf')
    x = y = -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if r_distances[i][j] != float('inf') and j_distances[i][j] != float('inf'):
                max_dist = max(r_distances[i][j], j_distances[i][j])
                if max_dist < tmin:
                    tmin = max_dist
                    x, y = i + 1, j + 1
    return tmin, x, y

# Read from rj.in
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Find Romeo and Juliet's locations
r_start = j_start = (-1, -1)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '  # Mark the start position as space
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '  # Mark the start position as space

# Compute distances from Romeo and Juliet's homes to all points
r_distances = bfs(matrix, r_start, n, m)
j_distances = bfs(matrix, j_start, n, m)

# Determine the optimal meeting point
tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m)

# Write to rj.out
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")
```

In this corrected version, we make sure to initialize `r_start` and `j_start` to a default value of `(-1, -1)` so that we can safely handle cases where we don't find 'R' or 'J' in the matrix. We also ensure to use `elif` to avoid changing `j_start` after having found `r_start`. This should prevent the IndexError from happening again.

It seems my previous attempts to fix the problem were not successful. The IndexError indicates that the program is trying to access an index in the matrix that does not exist. To ensure this does not happen, we must carefully check the matrix dimensions when reading from the file and when iterating over the matrix.

Given that the input file structure may cause issues if there are any trailing spaces or inconsistencies in the number of characters per line, we should also make sure to validate the matrix dimensions as we read it.

Let's attempt another corrected solution:

```python
# RJ Challenge Solution

from collections import deque

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m):
    tmin = float('inf')
    x = y = -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if r_distances[i][j] != float('inf') and j_distances[i][j] != float('inf'):
                if max(r_distances[i][j], j_distances[i][j]) < tmin:
                    tmin = max(r_distances[i][j], j_distances[i][j])
                    x, y = i + 1, j + 1
    return tmin, x, y

# Read from rj.in
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = []
    for _ in range(n):
        line = list(file.readline().strip())
        assert len(line) == m, "Matrix line does not match expected width"
        matrix.append(line)

# Find Romeo and Juliet's locations
r_start = j_start = (-1, -1)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '  # Mark the start position as space
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_start = (i, j)
            matrix[i][j] = ' '  # Mark the start position as space

# Compute distances from Romeo and Juliet's homes to all points
r_distances = bfs(matrix, r_start, n, m)
j_distances = bfs(matrix, j_start, n, m)

# Determine the optimal meeting point
tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m)

# Write to rj.out
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")
```

In this revision, I have added an assertion to ensure that each line read from the matrix has exactly `m` characters (as per the matrix dimensions provided in the first line of the input file). This should prevent any potential IndexError caused by lines of incorrect length. Additionally, I've left the BFS and meeting point finding logic unchanged because it should work correctly once the input is validated.

The assertion error indicates that the actual length of a line we read from the input file does not match the expected width `m`. This can occur due to extra whitespace characters at the end of the lines in the input file or if the data is malformed. Since the input file is supposed to be well-formed according to the problem statement, we will remove the assertion and instead strip white spaces at the end of each line.

Here's the final code with the fix:

        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_start = (i, j)
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_start = (i, j)

# Make sure R and J are replaced with spaces for BFS
matrix[r_start[0]][r_start[1]] = ' '
matrix[j_start[0]][j_start[1]] = ' '

# Compute distances from Romeo and Juliet's homes to all points
r_distances = bfs(matrix, r_start, n, m)
j_distances = bfs(matrix, j_start, n, m)

# Determine the optimal meeting point
tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m)

# Write to rj.out
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")
```

The changes made include:
- Stripping trailing white spaces on each line read from the file using `rstrip()`.
- Ensuring that 'R' and 'J' positions are treated as spaces (' ') before running BFS, so paths from their locations can be calculated properly.
- Removed the assertion since we now clean up white spaces at the end of lines when reading the input file.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output occurs because the current logic finds the first meeting point where both Romeo and Juliet can arrive in equal time, but it does not ensure that this time is minimal for both of them. We need to adjust the logic to find the point where they both can arrive at the same time, with the smallest maximum time among all such points.

An efficient way to solve this problem is to first perform a BFS from Romeo's starting point to calculate the distance to each reachable point, then perform a BFS from Juliet's starting point. After that, we find the reachable point with the minimum maximum distance from both starting points. If there are multiple points satisfying the condition, we pick the first one in the reading order (i.e., top to bottom, left to right).

Here's the revised code:

```python
# RJ Challenge Solution

from collections import deque

DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1)]

def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[None] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] is None:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m):
    tmin = float('inf')
    meeting_point = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if r_distances[i][j] is not None and j_distances[i][j] is not None:
                max_dist = max(r_distances[i][j], j_distances[i][j])
                if max_dist < tmin:
                    tmin = max_dist
                    meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # +1 for 1-based indexing
    return tmin, meeting_point

# Read from rj.in
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().rstrip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Find Romeo and Juliet's locations
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_start = (i, j)
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_start = (i, j)

# Perform BFS for Romeo and Juliet
r_distances = bfs(matrix, r_start, n, m)
j_distances = bfs(matrix, j_start, n, m)

# Determine the optimal meeting point
tmin, meeting_point = find_meeting_point(r_distances, j_distances, n, m)
x, y = meeting_point

# Write to rj.out
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")
```

This code ensures that we find the optimal meeting point with the smallest maximum time for both Romeo and Juliet to arrive. The BFS is performed separately from each starting point with the distances initialized to `None` to ensure that only reachable points are considered. After both BFS computations, the `find_meeting_point` function determines the optimal meeting point by selecting the one with the minimum maximum travel time for both characters. This should yield the correct output.
