În ultima ecranizare a celebrei piese shakespeariene Romeo şi Julieta trăiesc într-un oraş modern, comunică prin e-mail şi chiar învaţă să programeze. Într-o secvenţă tulburătoare sunt prezentate frământările interioare ale celor doi eroi încercând fără succes să scrie un program care să determine un punct optim de întâlnire. 

Ei au analizat harta oraşului şi au reprezentat-o sub forma unei matrice cu $n$ linii şi $m$ coloane, în matrice fiind marcate cu spaţiu zonele prin care se poate trece (străzi lipsite de pericole) şi cu `X` zonele prin care nu se poate trece. De asemenea, în matrice au marcat cu `R` locul în care se află locuinţa lui Romeo, iar cu `J` locul în care se află locuinţa Julietei. 

Ei se pot deplasa numai prin zonele care sunt marcate cu spaţiu, din poziţia curentă în oricare dintre cele 8 poziţii învecinate (pe orizontală, verticală sau diagonale).

Cum lui Romeo nu îi place să aştepte şi nici să se lase aşteptat n-ar fi tocmai bine, ei au hotărât că trebuie să aleagă un punct de întâlnire în care atât Romeo, cât şi Julieta să poată ajunge în acelaşi timp, plecând de acasă. Fiindcă la întâlniri amândoi vin într-un suflet, ei estimează timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la întâlnire prin numărul de elemente din matrice care constituie drumul cel mai scurt de acasă până la punctul de întâlnire. Şi cum probabil există mai multe puncte de întâlnire posibile, ei vor să îl aleagă pe cel în care timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la punctul de întâlnire este minim.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine o poziţie pe hartă la care Romeo şi Julieta pot să ajungă în acelaşi timp. Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul trebuie să determine o soluţie pentru care timpul este minim.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `rj.in` conţine:
* pe prima linie numerele naturale `N M`, care reprezintă numărul de linii şi respectiv de coloane ale matricei, separate prin spaţiu;
* pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află $M$ caractere (care pot fi doar `R`, `J`, `X` sau spaţiu) reprezentând matricea.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `rj.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care sunt scrise trei numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu `tmin x y`, având semnificaţia:
* `x y` reprezinţă punctul de întâlnire ($x$ – numărul liniei, $y$ – numărul coloanei);
* `tmin` este timpul minim în care Romeo (respectiv Julieta) ajunge la punctul de întâlnire.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N, M \leq 100$;
* Liniile şi coloanele matricei sunt numerotate începând cu 1.
* Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie.

`rj.in`
```
5 8
XXR  XXX
 X  X  X
J X X  X
      XX

from collections import deque

# Constants for the moves
MOVES = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Function to perform BFS and return the distances from source
def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[-1] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in MOVES:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

# Read from 'rj.in'
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

    # Find the positions of Romeo and Juliet
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
                r_pos = (i, j)
            elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
                j_pos = (i, j)

# Perform BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
dist_r = bfs(matrix, r_pos, n, m)
dist_j = bfs(matrix, j_pos, n, m)

# Find the optimal meeting point
tmin, meeting_point = float('inf'), None
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == ' ' and dist_r[i][j] >= 0 and dist_j[i][j] >= 0:
            max_dist = max(dist_r[i][j], dist_j[i][j])
            if max_dist < tmin:
                tmin, meeting_point = max_dist, (i + 1, j + 1)

# Write to 'rj.out'
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {meeting_point[0]} {meeting_point[1]}\n")
```

This code first reads the map from `rj.in` and identifies the locations of Romeo (`R`) and Juliet (`J`). It then performs Breadth-First Search (BFS) from both locations to calculate the distances from Romeo's and Juliet's homes to all the other points in the map that are accessible. It looks for the point that is accessible to both Romeo and Juliet with equal and minimum distances (optimal meeting point). Finally, it writes the result to `rj.out`.

The error `IndexError: list index out of range` suggests that the code is trying to access an index of the `matrix` list which does not exist. This issue might be caused by not correctly reading the file and populating the `matrix`, or by an improper loop that goes out of the bounds of the `matrix`.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the file is read correctly and that our loops for finding Romeo's and Juliet's positions do not exceed the matrix dimensions. Below is the revised code with necessary fixes:

```python
from collections import deque

# Constants for the moves
MOVES = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Function to perform BFS and return the distances from source
def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[-1] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in MOVES:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

# Read from 'rj.in'
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize positions
r_pos, j_pos = None, None

# Find the positions of Romeo and Juliet
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_pos = (i, j)
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_pos = (i, j)

# Ensure positions were found
if r_pos is None or j_pos is None:
    raise ValueError("Romeo and/or Juliet's position not found")

# Perform BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
dist_r = bfs(matrix, r_pos, n, m)
dist_j = bfs(matrix, j_pos, n, m)

# Find the optimal meeting point
tmin = float('inf')
meeting_point = None
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == ' ' and dist_r[i][j] >= 0 and dist_j[i][j] >= 0:
            max_dist = max(dist_r[i][j], dist_j[i][j])
            if max_dist < tmin:
                tmin = max_dist
                meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # adjusting index for 1-based

# Write to 'rj.out'
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {meeting_point[0]} {meeting_point[1]}\n")
```

This code should fix the `IndexError` by making sure that the file is read correctly, and that the loops looking for Romeo's and Juliet's positions do not try to access an index outside the range of the matrix. When the positions are found, the code performs BFS from both positions, finds the optimal meeting point, and writes the result to `rj.out`.

It seems there are still issues with the indices or the file reading process. The error indicates that the code is trying to access an element of the `matrix` that doesn't exist, which implies the indices `i` and `j` are going out of the valid range. It's also possible that the lines in the input file are not being read correctly, however, the given code for reading the file seems correct.

To ensure that the code handles the file reading correctly and doesn't go out of bounds, I will make sure that the matrix is populated correctly and then revise the code that traverses the matrix. Let's revise the code to make sure the input is being handled appropriately:

```python
from collections import deque

# Constants for the moves
MOVES = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Function to perform BFS and return the distances from source
def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[-1] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in MOVES:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

# Read from 'rj.in'
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the positions of Romeo and Juliet
r_pos = j_pos = None
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_pos = (i, j)
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_pos = (i, j)

# Perform BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
dist_r = bfs(matrix, r_pos, n, m)
dist_j = bfs(matrix, j_pos, n, m)

# Initialize variables to track the optimal meeting point
tmin = float('inf')
meeting_point = (0, 0)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == ' ' and dist_r[i][j] != -1 and dist_j[i][j] != -1:
            local_max = max(dist_r[i][j], dist_j[i][j])
            if local_max < tmin:
                tmin = local_max
                meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

# Write to 'rj.out'
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {meeting_point[0]} {meeting_point[1]}\n")
```

In this revision, we ensure that input is read correctly and stripped of any potential whitespace. Additionally, the loop correctly finds the positions of Romeo and Juliet. The BFS function computes the distances, and the final loop determines the meeting point within the bounds of the matrix. This code should work without index errors, assuming the input file `rj.in` is correctly formatted.

It appears the issue persists with accessing indices outside of the list's bounds. To better understand and fix the issue, let's introduce an explicit check for Romeo and Juliet's positions during the matrix reading process, ensuring these positions are found before proceeding. Additionally, we'll make sure that the indices are within the bounds when searching for Romeo and Juliet in the matrix. Here's the modified code:

```python
from collections import deque

# Constants for the moves
MOVES = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Function to perform BFS and return the distances from source
def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in MOVES:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

# Read from 'rj.in' and find the positions of Romeo and Juliet
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    matrix = []
    r_pos = j_pos = None  # We initialize the positions to None

    # Read the matrix and search for R and J
    for i in range(n):
        line = list(file.readline().strip())
        matrix.append(line)
        if 'R' in line:
            r_pos = (i, line.index('R'))
        if 'J' in line:
            j_pos = (i, line.index('J'))

# Ensure positions were found
if r_pos is None or j_pos is None:
    raise ValueError("Romeo and/or Juliet's position not found")

# Perform BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
dist_r = bfs(matrix, r_pos, n, m)
dist_j = bfs(matrix, j_pos, n, m)

# Find the optimal meeting point
tmin = float('inf')
meeting_point = None

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == ' ' and dist_r[i][j] != float('inf') and dist_j[i][j] != float('inf'):
            max_dist = max(dist_r[i][j], dist_j[i][j])
            if max_dist < tmin:
                tmin = max_dist
                meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

# Write to 'rj.out'
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {meeting_point[0]} {meeting_point[1]}\n")
```

In this version, we read the matrix line by line and immediately check for the existence of 'R' and 'J'. Once the positions of Romeo and Juliet are found, we proceed with the BFS algorithm to find the shortest paths and then determine the optimal meeting point. This approach makes sure that we have valid starting positions before running BFS, which should eliminate the `IndexError`.

It appears that there is still an issue with the indices within the BFS function. The error is indicating that we are attempting to access an index that is out of range within the matrix. To ensure this doesn't happen, we need to be careful when enqueuing the next coordinates to visit, making sure they are within the valid range of the matrix.

Let's correct the BFS function implementation by adding additional checks to prevent out-of-range errors when accessing the matrix. Here's the revised and complete code:

```python
from collections import deque

# Constants for the moves (8 directions)
MOVES = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Function to perform BFS and return the distances from source
def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[None] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in MOVES:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] is None:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

# Read from 'rj.in'
r_pos = j_pos = None
matrix = []

with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    for i in range(n):
        row = list(file.readline().strip())
        matrix.append(row)
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 'R':
                r_pos = (i, j)
            elif val == 'J':
                j_pos = (i, j)

# Check if both Romeo and Juliet's positions were found
if r_pos is None or j_pos is None:
    raise ValueError("Could not find positions for Romeo and/or Juliet!")

# Perform BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
dist_r = bfs(matrix, r_pos, n, m)
dist_j = bfs(matrix, j_pos, n, m)

# Find the optimal meeting point
tmin = None
meeting_point = None

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == ' ' and dist_r[i][j] is not None and dist_j[i][j] is not None:
            max_dist = max(dist_r[i][j], dist_j[i][j])
            if tmin is None or max_dist < tmin:
                tmin = max_dist
                meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

if tmin is None:
    raise ValueError("Could not find a meeting point!")

# Write to 'rj.out'
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {meeting_point[0]} {meeting_point[1]}\n")
```

In this corrected version, we first check for valid positions of Romeo and Juliet before proceeding with the BFS function. We avoid potential index out-of-range errors by ensuring that our BFS function correctly checks the boundary conditions. Additionally, we only enqueue positions that are within the matrix' boundaries. This should fix the IndexError and provide a correct solution for the problem.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there's still an issue with going out of bounds during the BFS. One possible cause might be that some of the neighboring positions being checked are outside of the matrix boundaries.

To avoid this, we need to make sure that we only enqueue positions that are within the matrix boundaries. Let's revise the implementation of the BFS function to add stricter bounds checking:

```python
from collections import deque

# Constants for the moves (8 directions)
MOVES = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Function to perform BFS and return the distances from source
def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[None] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in MOVES:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m:
                if matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] is None:
                    distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                    queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

# Read from 'rj.in'
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the positions of Romeo and Juliet
r_pos = j_pos = None
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == 'R':
            r_pos = (i, j)
        elif matrix[i][j] == 'J':
            j_pos = (i, j)

# Perform BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
dist_r = bfs(matrix, r_pos, n, m)
dist_j = bfs(matrix, j_pos, n, m)

# Initialize variables to track the optimal meeting point
tmin = float('inf')
meeting_point = None

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == ' ' and dist_r[i][j] is not None and dist_j[i][j] is not None:
            max_dist = max(dist_r[i][j], dist_j[i][j])

                tmin = max_dist
                meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

# Write to 'rj.out'
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {meeting_point[0]} {meeting_point[1]}\n")
```

This version of the BFS function includes an additional check to ensure that we don't access elements outside the matrix boundaries. Additionally, we verify that both Romeo and Juliet's positions are found before starting the BFS. This should address the IndexError issue and ensure that the program runs correctly.

It seems that the `IndexError` issue persists, likely because we are not correctly ensuring that the indices `i` and `j` stay within the bounds of the `matrix`. To address this, let's revise the reading of the input file `rj.in` and the matrix traversal to be absolutely certain that we never use an out-of-bounds index.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from collections import deque

# Constants for the moves (8 directions)
MOVES = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Function to perform BFS and return the distances from source
def bfs(matrix, start, n, m):
    queue = deque([start])
    distances = [[None] * m for _ in range(n)]
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in MOVES:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m:
                if matrix[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] is None:
                    distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                    queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

# Read from 'rj.in'
with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = []
    for _ in range(n):
        matrix.append(list(file.readline().strip()))

# Find the positions of Romeo and Juliet
r_pos = j_pos = None
for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
        if val == 'R':
            r_pos = (i, j)
        elif val == 'J':
            j_pos = (i, j)
        if r_pos and j_pos:
            break
    if r_pos and j_pos:
        break

# Perform BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
dist_r = bfs(matrix, r_pos, n, m)
dist_j = bfs(matrix, j_pos, n, m)

# Find the optimal meeting point
tmin = float('inf')
meeting_point = None

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] == ' ' and dist_r[i][j] is not None and dist_j[i][j] is not None:
            max_dist = max(dist_r[i][j], dist_j[i][j])
            if max_dist < tmin:
                tmin = max_dist
                meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

# Write to 'rj.out'
with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{tmin} {meeting_point[0]} {meeting_point[1]}\n")
```

In this updated version, I've used `enumerate` to safely get the indices and values when reading the matrix and finding the positions of Romeo and Juliet. This will ensure we are always within the bounds of the matrix. Additionally, once Romeo and Juliet's positions are found, we break out of the loops to avoid any unnecessary processing. This code should now be free from `IndexError` issues.
