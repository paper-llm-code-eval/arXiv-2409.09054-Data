În ultima ecranizare a celebrei piese shakespeariene Romeo şi Julieta trăiesc într-un oraş modern, comunică prin e-mail şi chiar învaţă să programeze. Într-o secvenţă tulburătoare sunt prezentate frământările interioare ale celor doi eroi încercând fără succes să scrie un program care să determine un punct optim de întâlnire. 

Ei au analizat harta oraşului şi au reprezentat-o sub forma unei matrice cu $n$ linii şi $m$ coloane, în matrice fiind marcate cu spaţiu zonele prin care se poate trece (străzi lipsite de pericole) şi cu `X` zonele prin care nu se poate trece. De asemenea, în matrice au marcat cu `R` locul în care se află locuinţa lui Romeo, iar cu `J` locul în care se află locuinţa Julietei. 

Ei se pot deplasa numai prin zonele care sunt marcate cu spaţiu, din poziţia curentă în oricare dintre cele 8 poziţii învecinate (pe orizontală, verticală sau diagonale).

Cum lui Romeo nu îi place să aştepte şi nici să se lase aşteptat n-ar fi tocmai bine, ei au hotărât că trebuie să aleagă un punct de întâlnire în care atât Romeo, cât şi Julieta să poată ajunge în acelaşi timp, plecând de acasă. Fiindcă la întâlniri amândoi vin într-un suflet, ei estimează timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la întâlnire prin numărul de elemente din matrice care constituie drumul cel mai scurt de acasă până la punctul de întâlnire. Şi cum probabil există mai multe puncte de întâlnire posibile, ei vor să îl aleagă pe cel în care timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la punctul de întâlnire este minim.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine o poziţie pe hartă la care Romeo şi Julieta pot să ajungă în acelaşi timp. Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul trebuie să determine o soluţie pentru care timpul este minim.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `rj.in` conţine:
* pe prima linie numerele naturale `N M`, care reprezintă numărul de linii şi respectiv de coloane ale matricei, separate prin spaţiu;
* pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află $M$ caractere (care pot fi doar `R`, `J`, `X` sau spaţiu) reprezentând matricea.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `rj.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care sunt scrise trei numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu `tmin x y`, având semnificaţia:
* `x y` reprezinţă punctul de întâlnire ($x$ – numărul liniei, $y$ – numărul coloanei);
* `tmin` este timpul minim în care Romeo (respectiv Julieta) ajunge la punctul de întâlnire.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N, M \leq 100$;
* Liniile şi coloanele matricei sunt numerotate începând cu 1.
* Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie.

                if max_time < min_time:

    tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(n, m, city_map)
    write_output('rj.out', tmin, x, y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this solution, the BFS function computes the distance from a given start point (Romeo's or Juliet's house) to all reachable points. Then, we find a meeting point that minimizes the maximum time it takes for either Romeo or Juliet to reach it. The output is then written to the `rj.out` file.

It appears that the program is encountering an IndexError because of trying to access an index out of range in the city_map. This could potentially be due to incorrect parsing of the input file `rj.in`, leading to incorrect dimensions or content for the `city_map` list. Let's go step by step, ensuring that we correctly parse the input, handle the map, and apply the BFS correctly. Here's an updated version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1)]

def bfs(city_map, start, n, m):
    distances = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque([start])
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and city_map[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(city_map):
    n, m = len(city_map), len(city_map[0])
    romeo = juliet = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == 'R':
                romeo = (i, j)
            elif city_map[i][j] == 'J':
                juliet = (i, j)

    distances_from_romeo = bfs(city_map, romeo, n, m)
    distances_from_juliet = bfs(city_map, juliet, n, m)

    min_time = float('inf')
    meeting_point = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == ' ' and distances_from_romeo[i][j] != -1 and distances_from_juliet[i][j] != -1:
                max_time = max(distances_from_romeo[i][j], distances_from_juliet[i][j])
                if max_time < min_time:
                    min_time = max_time
                    meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
    
    return min_time, meeting_point[0], meeting_point[1]

def main():
    with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        city_map = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

    tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(city_map)

    with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution includes a modified BFS that does not assume the map has been pre-processed to replace the characters with spaces. Instead, it uses the characters directly. It also uses the actual dimensions of the `city_map` to avoid the IndexError. The main function handles the file operations, ensuring the input is correctly read and the output is correctly written.

It seems the IndexError persists, which suggests the dimensions of the `city_map` may be incorrect or there may be an issue when parsing the input file. To avoid this issue, let's ensure that we're correctly reading the file, and that the dimensions `n` and `m` are being used properly throughout the solution. I'll rewrite the entire solution with fixes:

```python
from collections import deque

DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]

def bfs(city_map, start, n, m):
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque([start])
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and city_map[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m):
    romeo = juliet = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == 'R':
                romeo = (i, j)
            elif city_map[i][j] == 'J':
                juliet = (i, j)

    if not romeo or not juliet:
        return None

    distances_from_romeo = bfs(city_map, romeo, n, m)
    distances_from_juliet = bfs(city_map, juliet, n, m)

    min_time = float('inf')
    meeting_point = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == ' ' and distances_from_romeo[i][j] != float('inf') and distances_from_juliet[i][j] != float('inf'):
                max_time = max(distances_from_romeo[i][j], distances_from_juliet[i][j])
                if max_time < min_time:
                    min_time = max_time
                    meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
    
    if min_time == float('inf'):
        return None
    return min_time, meeting_point[0], meeting_point[1]

def main():
    with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        city_map = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

    result = find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m)
    if result:
        tmin, x, y = result
        with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
            file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution takes the same approach but with careful handling of the dimensions of the `city_map` and proper error checking to ensure `romeo` and `juliet` are found within the map. If there is no meeting point, the code will not attempt to write to `rj.out`.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's attempt to fix this issue again by ensuring we're not accessing the `city_map` out of its bounds. We'll also add some additional checks to ensure that the input file is properly formatted and contains the expected number of lines and characters per line.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

def bfs(city_map, start, n, m):
    distances = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque([start])
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and city_map[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m):
    romeo = juliet = None

    # Find Romeo's and Juliet's houses
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == 'R':
                romeo = (i, j)
            elif city_map[i][j] == 'J':
                juliet = (i, j)
    
    # Run BFS for both Romeo and Juliet
    distances_from_romeo = bfs(city_map, romeo, n, m)
    distances_from_juliet = bfs(city_map, juliet, n, m)

    # Find the optimal meeting point
    meeting_point = (0, 0)
    min_time = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == ' ' and distances_from_romeo[i][j] >= 0 and distances_from_juliet[i][j] >= 0:
                time = max(distances_from_romeo[i][j], distances_from_juliet[i][j])
                if time < min_time:
                    min_time = time
                    meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # 1-based indexing
    return min_time, meeting_point[0], meeting_point[1]

def main():
    with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        city_map = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
        assert all(len(row) == m for row in city_map), "Invalid map dimensions"

    tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m)

    with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution includes a check to ensure that the map has the expected number of rows and each row has the expected number of characters. The BFS function is used to find the shortest path distances from Romeo's and Juliet's houses to all other reachable points. Then, the program finds the meeting point where the maximum of the distances from Romeo and Juliet is minimized. Finally, the program writes the result to the `rj.out` file. Please ensure that the input file `rj.in` is correctly formatted according to the problem statement before running the code.

The `AssertionError` indicates that the input map dimensions do not match the expected format. This might be happening due to extra spaces in the input lines or a mismatch in the number of characters. I will remove the assertion and rewrite the program with a more robust input reading to ensure that the correct number of characters is read for each line, even if there are trailing spaces. Here is the corrected solution:

```python

    distances = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque([start])
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and city_map[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1

            elif city_map[i][j] == 'J':
                juliet = (i, j)

    distances_from_romeo = bfs(city_map, romeo, n, m)
    distances_from_juliet = bfs(city_map, juliet, n, m)

                time = max(distances_from_romeo[i][j], distances_from_juliet[i][j])
                if time < min_time:
                    min_time = time
                    meeting_point = (i+1, j+1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

def main():
    with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        city_map = []
        for _ in range(n):
            line = file.readline().strip()
            # Ensure each line has exactly m characters, filling in any missing spaces.
            line += ' ' * (m - len(line))
            city_map.append(list(line))

    tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m)

    with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":

```
I have removed the assertion that was checking map dimensions and instead added a line to pad each row with spaces if it's shorter than expected. This should ensure that each row of the map has exactly `m` characters, thus preventing index errors when accessing the map. Please make sure that the input file `rj.in` has the correct format, with exactly `n` lines following the first line, and each line should have `m` characters (not counting the newline character). If there are extra spaces at the end of lines, they will be trimmed by the `strip()` function and then padded back to the correct length.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found result indicates a logical error in the solution. Upon reviewing the code, the mistake might be in how the minimum time and the meeting point are being determined.

The current approach is taking the maximum of distances from Romeo and Juliet to a given point and comparing it with the minimum time observed so far. However, it is not checking whether both Romeo and Juliet can arrive at the meeting point at exactly the same time, which is a specific requirement of the problem statement.

To correct this, the algorithm should find a point where the distances from both Romeo and Juliet are not only minimized but also equal, ensuring they can arrive simultaneously. Additionally, if there are multiple such points, the one with the smallest distance should be chosen.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
from collections import deque

DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

def bfs(city_map, start, n, m):
    distances = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque([start])
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and city_map[nx][ny] == ' ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m):
    romeo = juliet = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == 'R':
                romeo = (i, j)
            elif city_map[i][j] == 'J':
                juliet = (i, j)

    distances_from_romeo = bfs(city_map, romeo, n, m)
    distances_from_juliet = bfs(city_map, juliet, n, m)

    min_time = float('inf')
    meeting_point = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            # Ensure Romeo and Juliet can both reach the point and arrive at the same time
            if city_map[i][j] == ' ' and distances_from_romeo[i][j] != -1 and distances_from_juliet[i][j] != -1:
                if distances_from_romeo[i][j] == distances_from_juliet[i][j]:
                    time = distances_from_romeo[i][j]
                    if time < min_time:
                        min_time = time
                        meeting_point = (i+1, j+1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

    # If no meeting point is found where they can arrive at the same time, return an error or a default value
    if min_time == float('inf'):
        return -1, -1, -1
    return min_time, meeting_point[0], meeting_point[1]

def main():
    with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        city_map = []
        for _ in range(n):
            line = file.readline().rstrip('\n')
            assert len(line) == m, f"Invalid map line length: {line}"
            city_map.append(list(line))

    tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m)

    # If a valid meeting point is found, write it to the output file
    if tmin != -1:
        with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
            file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated solution searches for a point `(' ')` that is reachable by both Romeo and Juliet and where the distances from both of them to this point are the same. This ensures that they can arrive at the same time. The program then selects the meeting point among these with the smallest distance. If no such point exists where they can arrive simultaneously, the program will return a default value, indicating no valid meeting point was found. It's important to ensure that each line in the input file is of the correct length (`m` characters).

The issue appears to be with the criteria used to determine the optimal meeting point. The previous solution was looking for the point where Romeo and Juliet can arrive at the same time (where the distances are equal) and choosing the point with the smallest distance. However, the expected output suggests that we should be looking for the point where the maximum of the two distances is minimized, not just where the distances are equal.

The code should be finding a point where the two distances are equal (or as close to equal as possible) and of these, we should be choosing the one where the distance is longest (since this will be the minimum maximum distance that they can both achieve). Here is a revised solution which takes this into consideration:

```python
from collections import deque

DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

def bfs(city_map, start, n, m):
    distances = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque([start])
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and city_map[nx][ny] in ' RJ' and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = distances[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return distances

def find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m):
    romeo = juliet = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] == 'R':
                romeo = (i, j)
            elif city_map[i][j] == 'J':
                juliet = (i, j)

    distances_from_romeo = bfs(city_map, romeo, n, m)
    distances_from_juliet = bfs(city_map, juliet, n, m)

    min_time = float('inf')
    meeting_point = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if city_map[i][j] in ' RJ' and distances_from_romeo[i][j] != -1 and distances_from_juliet[i][j] != -1:
                if abs(distances_from_romeo[i][j] - distances_from_juliet[i][j]) <= min_time:
                    max_dist = max(distances_from_romeo[i][j], distances_from_juliet[i][j])
                    if max_dist < min_time or (max_dist == min_time and distances_from_romeo[i][j] < distances_from_romeo[meeting_point[0]-1][meeting_point[1]-1]):
                        min_time = max_dist
                        meeting_point = (i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing

    return min_time, meeting_point[0], meeting_point[1]

def main():
    with open('rj.in', 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        city_map = [file.readline().rstrip('\n') for _ in range(n)]

    tmin, x, y = find_meeting_point(city_map, n, m)

    with open('rj.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{tmin} {x} {y}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution still calculates the BFS distances from both Romeo's and Juliet's starting points. However, when it comes to picking the meeting point, it now checks for the smallest maximum distance (i.e., the minimum time it would take for the slower of the two to reach the meeting point). If there are multiple points with the same maximum distance, it chooses the one that maximizes the distance, since the problem statement specifies that we should minimize the time necessary to reach the meeting point, assuming they both start at the same time.
