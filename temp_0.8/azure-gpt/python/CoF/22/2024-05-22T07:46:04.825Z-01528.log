Se dă un arbore cu $N$ noduri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$.

Arborele se va transforma astfel: la oricare etapă fiecare nod de gradul $1$ diferit de rădăcină din arborele actual se înlocuiește cu un arbore identic cu cel dat inițial, iar la următoarea etapă procedeul se va relua pentru arborele obținut, formându-se astfel un arbore infinit. În următoarele $3$ imagini se prezintă un exemplu de arbore dat inițial, arborele obținut după prima etapă de prelungire a frunzelor și arborele obținut după $2$ etape de prelungire a frunzelor.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's re-evaluate the problem and implement the correct solution.

The initial implementation misunderstood how the tree evolves at each stage. At each iteration, every leaf node (except the root) spawns an entirely new copy of the initial tree. Therefore, we need to count the number of nodes at depth `D`. To do this, we can use dynamic programming. At each depth `d`, the number of new nodes will be the number of new leaves spawned at depth `d-1` times the number of nodes at depth `d` in the original tree.

Let's correct the solution with this understanding.

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def dfs_count(graph, node, depth, depth_counts):
    depth_counts[depth] += 1
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if depth_counts[neighbor] == 0:
            dfs_count(graph, neighbor, depth + 1, depth_counts)

# Read input, calculate and write output
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as fin:
    N = int(fin.readline().strip())
    D = int(fin.readline().strip())
    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        x, y = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        graph[x].append(y)
        graph[y].append(x)

# Count nodes at each depth
depth_counts = [0] * (N + 1)
dfs_count(graph, 1, 0, depth_counts)

# Calculate number of nodes at distance D using a dynamic programming approach
nodes_at_d = [0] * (D + 1)
nodes_at_d[0] = 1  # There is always 1 node at distance 0 (the root)

for d in range(1, D + 1):
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if depth_counts[i] == d:
            # Each node at depth d spawns depth_counts[i] new nodes
            nodes_at_d[d] += nodes_at_d[d - depth_counts[i]]

with open('tairos.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(nodes_at_d[D] % MOD) + '\n')
```

This solution reads the tree structure from `tairos.in`, uses depth-first search to count the number of nodes at each depth in the original tree, and then computes the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root after the tree has been extended. The result is written to `tairos.out`.

I understand that there is an issue with the current implementation. The logic to calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root after the tree has been extended is incorrect. 

In the correct approach, we need to consider each leaf node at depth `d` (in the original tree) will spawn an entire copy of the original tree at each step. The number of nodes at distance `D` can then be calculated by finding how many times this spawning process occurs within our target distance `D`.

Let's implement the correct logic:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def dfs(graph, node, parent, depth, depths, leaves):
    if len(graph[node]) == 1 and node != 1:  # it's a leaf
        leaves.append(depth)
        return
    for child in graph[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(graph, child, node, depth + 1, depths, leaves)

with open('tairos.in', 'r') as fin:
    N = int(fin.readline().strip())
    D = int(fin.readline().strip())
    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        x, y = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        graph[x].append(y)
        graph[y].append(x)

# Perform a DFS to find the depth of each leaf node
depths = [0] * (N + 1)
leaves = []
dfs(graph, 1, -1, 0, depths, leaves)

# Initialize the number of nodes at each depth in the original tree
nodes_at_depth = [0] * (N + 1)
for depth in leaves:
    nodes_at_depth[depth] += 1

# Calculate the number of nodes at distance D using dynamic programming
dp = [0] * (D + 1)
dp[0] = 1  # The root is at distance 0

# Calculate number of nodes at each depth for extended tree
for d in range(1, D + 1):
    for leaf_depth in leaves:
        if d >= leaf_depth:
            dp[d] = (dp[d] + dp[d - leaf_depth]) % MOD

result = dp[D]

with open('tairos.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

Now the solution should find the correct number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinitely extended tree. The result is then written to `tairos.out`.

I apologize for the confusion in the previous solutions. Upon reviewing the problem again, I recognize that each leaf node of the original tree, with exception of the root, will spawn an entire new copy of the original tree at its position in every iteration, not just at a fixed depth as previously calculated. We need to calculate how many nodes at distance `D` we can accumulate by this expansion process.

Given the nature of the problem, which is combinatorial, we need to keep track of the number of leaves that are at a particular depth in the original tree, and then use a combinatorial approach to calculate how these leaves spawn nodes at distance `D` after multiple iterations.

Let's correct the solution as follows:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def dfs(graph, node, parent, depth, leaf_depths):
    if len(graph[node]) == 1 and node != 1:  # it's a leaf
        leaf_depths[depth] = leaf_depths.get(depth, 0) + 1
        return
    for child in graph[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(graph, child, node, depth + 1, leaf_depths)

with open('tairos.in', 'r') as fin:
    N = int(fin.readline().strip())
    D = int(fin.readline().strip())
    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        x, y = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        graph[x].append(y)
        graph[y].append(x)

# Perform a DFS to find the depth of each leaf node and count them
leaf_depths = {}
dfs(graph, 1, -1, 0, leaf_depths)

# Calculate the number of nodes at distance D
result = 0
for depth, count in leaf_depths.items():
    if depth <= D:
        # The number of nodes at distance D is the number of leaves at
        # a certain depth times the number of nodes at (D - depth) in the original tree
        result = (result + count * leaf_depths.get(D - depth, 0)) % MOD

with open('tairos.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This implementation should correctly calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` in the new tree structure based on the number of leaves at each depth of the original tree. The result will be written to `tairos.out`.

To fix the issue, we should reconsider the spawning process. Each leaf node will spawn a new copy of the original tree at each step. Therefore, at distance `D`, we can have nodes from the original tree if `D` is equal to their depth, or nodes from spawned trees if `D` is greater.

We need to calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` by considering the number of leaf nodes at each depth and how many times a leaf node would contribute to the count of nodes at distance `D` when new trees are spawned from it. 

Let's correct the solution by implementing this logic:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def dfs(graph, node, depth, leaf_depths, visited):
    visited[node] = True
    is_leaf = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, depth + 1, leaf_depths, visited)
            is_leaf = False
    if is_leaf and node != 1:  # Exclude the root from leaf nodes
        leaf_depths[depth] = leaf_depths.get(depth, 0) + 1

# Function to calculate the modular exponentiation
def mod_pow(base, exponent):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % MOD
        base = (base * base) % MOD
        exponent >>= 1
    return result

with open('tairos.in', 'r') as fin:
    N = int(fin.readline().strip())
    D = int(fin.readline().strip())
    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        x, y = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        graph[x].append(y)
        graph[y].append(x)

leaf_depths = {}
visited = [False] * (N + 1)
dfs(graph, 1, 0, leaf_depths, visited)

result = 0
for depth, leaf_count in leaf_depths.items():
    if depth <= D:
        # How many times will this depth contribute to nodes at distance D?
        contributions = mod_pow(leaf_count, (D - depth))
        # Add contributions multiplied by the number of leaf nodes at this depth
        result = (result + contributions * leaf_count) % MOD

with open('tairos.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should correctly calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinitely extended tree, considering the contribution of each leaf node at each depth of the original tree. The result is written to `tairos.out`.
