La ora de matematică distractivă, domnul profesor Numerus propune elevilor săi să completeze cu numere naturale o grilă cu $6$ coloane numerotate cu literele $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ şi $F$ şi cu un număr infinit de linii. Grila va fi completată cu numere naturale, începând cu numărul $1$. Pe liniile impare completarea se va face de la stânga la dreapta, iar pe cele pare de la dreapta la stânga. Ultimul număr de pe o linie va fi identic cu penultimul număr (în sensul completării) de pe aceeaşi linie.

În figura alăturată aveţi completate primele $7$ linii ale grilei.

Deoarece pe tablă sau pe o foaie de hârtie numărul de linii este limitat, deci grila poate fi efectiv completată doar pentru un număr mic de linii, domnul profesor Numerus doreşte ca elevii săi să determine, cu ajutorul calculatorului, imaginea unei anumite linii a grilei şi locul sau locurile pe care se poate afla un număr natural dat.

# Cerință

Deduceţi regula după care se completează linia $k$ a grilei şi scrieţi un program care să citească numerele naturale $k$ şi $n$ şi care să determine:

a) numerele naturale de pe linia $k$, vizualizate de la stânga la dreapta;
b) linia pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$;
c) coloana sau coloanele pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numerus.in` conține o singură linie pe care sunt scrise două numere naturale $k$ şi $n$, separate printr-un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `numerus.out` va conține $3$ linii:

* pe prima linie, se vor scrie numerele de pe linia $k$ a grilei;
* pe a doua linie, se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând linia pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$;
* pe a treia linie, se va scrie litera sau literele care reprezintă coloana, respectiv coloanele pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$; în situaţia în care avem de afişat două litere acestea se vor afişa cu un spaţiu între ele.
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă 40% din punctaj, pentru cerinţa b) 30% din punctaj şi pentru cerinţa c) 30% din punctaj.


# Restricții și precizări

* $5 \leq k < 2 \cdot 10^8$;
* $1 \leq n < 10^9$;

I've written this solution bearing in mind the restrictions and the need for efficiency. It does not use any external libraries and should perform well for large values of `k` and `n` within the constraints given. To execute the code, save it as `numerus.py` and ensure the `numerus.in` file is in the same directory before running the script.

The error occurs because the list `col` expects an index that is within the range `0` to `5`, but the `pos_in_row` value can be `6` when `n` is the repeated number at the end of a row. The calculation for the position within the row does not account for the doubling of the last number in each row, and this needs to be corrected.

Here is a revised version of the solution which corrects the problem:

```python
def calculate_line(k):
    start_value = 3 * (k - 1) * k // 2 + 1
    return [start_value + i + (i == 5) for i in range(6)]

def find_line_and_col(n):
    if n == 1:  # Special case for the first number
        return 1, 'A'
    
    # Find the line where number n could be without the duplication of the last number
    row = int(((8 * n + 1) ** 0.5 - 1) / 2)
    triangular_number = row * (row + 1) // 2
    corrected_row = row if 3 * triangular_number >= n else row + 1
    
    # Calculate the start of the row
    start_of_row = 3 * (corrected_row - 1) * corrected_row // 2 + 1
    pos_in_row = n - start_of_row
    
    # Find the correct column, adjusting for the reversed order on even rows and the duplicated last number
    if corrected_row % 2 == 1:  # Odd row: numbers increase left to right
        if pos_in_row >= 5:
            col = 'F'
        else:
            col = chr(ord('A') + pos_in_row)
    else:  # Even row: numbers increase right to left
        if pos_in_row >= 5:
            col = 'A B'
        else:
            col = chr(ord('F') - pos_in_row)
    
    return corrected_row, col

with open('numerus.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())

line_k = calculate_line(k)
line_n, col_n = find_line_and_col(n)

with open('numerus.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, line_k)) + '\n')
    fout.write(str(line_n) + '\n')
    fout.write(col_n + '\n')
```

This should now correctly calculate both the row and column for `n` and handle the special case where `n` is the duplicated number at the end of the row. The corrected code takes into account the change of direction for even and odd rows and the duplicated last number in each row.

Based on the given feedback, it's clear that my previous solution miscalculated the numbers on line `k` and incorrectly identified the row and columns for number `n`. This means my functions `calculate_line` and `find_line_and_col` need to be revised.

I will correct the implementations of both functions to adhere to the described pattern in the challenge. The `calculate_line` function needs to account for the rule that the last number in a row is duplicated. The `find_line_and_col` function must also correctly identify the row and column(s) where the number `n` is located, considering the back and forth pattern of number placement and the repeated last number in each row.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Calculate the numbers on line k
def calculate_line(k):
    if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd row, numbers increase left to right
        start_num = k * (k - 1) // 2 + 1
        return [start_num + i for i in range(5)] + [start_num + 4]
    else:  # Even row, numbers increase right to left
        start_num = k * (k + 1) // 2
        return [start_num - i for i in range(5, -1, -1)]

# Find the row and column(s) for number n
def find_line_and_col(n):
    # Find the row where n is located
    row = 1
    while n > row * (row + 1) // 2:
        row += 1
    row -= 1
    
    # Calculate the start of the row
    start_of_row = row * (row + 1) // 2
    pos_in_row = start_of_row - n
    
    # Determine the column based on the row and position
    if row % 2 == 1:  # Odd row
        if pos_in_row == 0:
            col = 'F'
        else:
            col = chr(ord('A') + (5 - pos_in_row))
    else:  # Even row
        if pos_in_row == 0:
            col = 'A B'
        else:
            col = chr(ord('A') + pos_in_row - 1)
    
    return row + 1, col

# Read input from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate output values
line_k = calculate_line(k)
line_n, col_n = find_line_and_col(n)

# Write output to file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, line_k)) + '\n')
    fout.write(str(line_n) + '\n')
    fout.write(col_n + '\n')
```

This solution follows the rule that on odd rows, the numbers increase from left to right, and on even rows, they decrease from right to left, with the last number duplicated. For identifying the row and column for number `n`, it takes into account the total count of numbers in previous rows by using triangular numbers to calculate the start of the row. Then it determines the column based on the row parity and position within the row. This solution should now meet the challenge requirements and produce the expected output.

The previous solution still contains errors in the logic for determining the numbers on line `k` and finding the correct line and column for number `n`. The algorithm for calculating the numbers on line `k` does not account for the rule that the last number in a row is duplicated correctly for even rows. The algorithm for finding the line and column for number `n` does not handle the back and forth pattern and repeated last number correctly.

Let's approach the challenge again.

To calculate the numbers on line `k`, we can determine the starting number on the line by using the formula that calculates the sum of arithmetic progression up to `k - 1` (not including `k` itself) and then adjust for the pattern of increment and the duplicated last number.

To find the line and column of `n`, we can calculate the triangular number that is immediately less than or equal to `n` to find the row that `n` would be in if there were no duplicated numbers. We then adjust this row number for the back and forth pattern and consider the repeated last number to find the correct column.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Calculate the numbers on line k
def calculate_line(k):
    base = (k - 1) * k // 2  # sum of arithmetic progression until k-1
    if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd row
        start_num = base + 1
        return [start_num + i for i in range(5)] + [start_num + 4]
    else:  # Even row
        start_num = base + k - 1
        return [start_num - i for i in range(5)] + [start_num - 4]

# Find the row and column(s) for number n
def find_line_and_col(n):
    # Find the row index by solving the quadratic inequality n <= row*(row+1)/2
    row = int(((1 + 8 * n) ** 0.5 - 1) // 2)
    # Find the starting number of that row
    start_of_row = row * (row + 1) // 2
    # Adjust for the repeated number at the end of each row
    if n > start_of_row - row:
        row += 1
    # Determine the position within the row, accounting for the back and forth pattern
    pos_in_row = n - (start_of_row - row + 1)
    if row % 2 == 1:  # Odd row
        if pos_in_row == row - 1:
            col = 'F'
        else:
            col = chr(ord('A') + pos_in_row)
    else:  # Even row
        if pos_in_row == 0:
            col = 'A B'
        else:
            col = chr(ord('F') - pos_in_row)

    return row, col

# Read input from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate output values
line_k = calculate_line(k)
line_n, col_n = find_line_and_col(n)

# Write output to file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, line_k)) + '\n')
    fout.write(str(line_n) + '\n')
    fout.write(col_n + '\n')
```

This corrected solution should now correctly output the numbers on line `k` and find the correct line and columns for number `n`, producing the expected results.

It seems the previous solutions did not correctly implement the rules described in the challenge. Let's try to solve the challenge again step by step:

1. To calculate the numbers on line `k`, we need to determine the starting and ending numbers for the line. The starting number for an odd line `k` is `1 + (k - 1) * k / 2` and for an even line is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. Then we populate the line accordingly, considering the back and forth pattern and the duplication of the last number.

2. To find the line and column for number `n`, we need to determine which triangular number range `n` falls into, considering the duplication of the last number of each line. Once we have the line, we can determine the column by calculating the position of `n` in that line.

Here is the corrected solution with a fixed algorithm:

```python
def calculate_line(k):
    # Calculate the first number in line k
    start_num = k * (k - 1) // 2 + 1
    if k % 2 == 0:  # Reverse order for even lines
        return [2 * start_num + 4 - i if i != 5 else 2 * start_num + 3 - i for i in range(6)]
    # Normal order for odd lines
    return [start_num + i if i != 5 else start_num + 4 for i in range(6)]

def find_line_and_col(n):
    # Find the row where n could be located without duplication
    row = int(((8 * n + 1) ** 0.5 - 1) // 2)
    # Calculate the number of elements up to the previous row
    prev_count = row * (row + 1) // 2
    # Adjust for the duplicated number in each row
    if n > prev_count + row:
        row += 1
    # Calculate the column
    n -= prev_count  # Position of n in its row
    if row % 2 == 0:  # Even row, reversed order
        cols = 'FEDCBA'
        if n == row:
            return row, cols[-n] + ' ' + cols[-n + 1]
        return row, cols[-n]
    else:  # Odd row, normal order
        cols = 'ABCDEF'
        if n == row:
            return row, cols[n - 1] + ' ' + cols[n - 2]
        return row, cols[n - 1]

# Read input from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate output values
line_k = calculate_line(k)
line_n, col_n = find_line_and_col(n)

# Write output to file

    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, line_k)) + '\n')
    fout.write(str(line_n) + '\n')
    fout.write(col_n + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the numbers on line `k` according to the specified rules, and find the correct line and columns for number `n`. The calculations take into account the back and forth pattern of number placement in the grid and the duplication of the last number in each line.

It appears that the previous solutions did not correctly account for the pattern of the numbers on each line and the positions of a given number `n` in the grid. Let's correct these mistakes.

To form the line `k`, we need to understand that the first number of line `k` will be the sum of the numbers of all previous lines plus one. Each line has `k - 1` numbers if we don't account for the duplication of the last number. Therefore, we can calculate the first number on line `k` using the formula for the sum of the arithmetic series: `first_number = 1 + sum(i for i in range(1, k))`. With the first number known, we then construct the line, duplicating the last number.

For finding the line and columns for the number `n`, we need to find `k` such that `n` is between the first number of line `k` and the first number of line `k+1`. This can again be done by finding which arithmetic series sum fits `n`. Once we have the line, we can figure out the columns based on whether `k` is even or odd.

Here is a corrected version of the algorithm:

```python
def calculate_line(k):
    # Calculate the first number on line k
    first_number = 1 + (k - 1) * k // 2
    # Determine the direction of the line filling
    if k % 2 == 0:  # Even line, filled from right to left
        line = [first_number + i for i in range(k-1)] + [first_number + k - 2]
        return line[::-1]
    else:  # Odd line, filled from left to right
        line = [first_number + i for i in range(k-1)] + [first_number + k - 2]
        return line

def find_line_and_col(n):
    # Determine the line number where n falls
    k = 1
    while n > k * (k + 1) // 2:
        k += 1
    first_number_of_k = 1 + (k - 1) * k // 2
    offset = n - first_number_of_k  # Offset of n in the k-th line
    
    # Handle even and odd line number cases
    if k % 2 == 0:  # Even line
        col_index = k - 2 - offset if offset < k - 1 else 0
        cols = "FEDCBA"
        if offset == k - 1:
            col = 'A B'
        else:
            col = cols[col_index]
    else:  # Odd line
        col_index = offset
        cols = "ABCDEF"
        if offset == k - 1:
            col = 'E F'
        else:
            col = cols[col_index]
    
    return k, col

# Read input from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate output values
line_k = calculate_line(k)
line_n, col_n = find_line_and_col(n)

# Write output to file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, line_k)) + '\n')
    fout.write(str(line_n) + '\n')
    fout.write(col_n + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the numbers on line `k` following the rules specified, and correctly find the line and columns for the number `n`. The calculations properly account for the arithmetic series sum, the back and forth pattern of number placement, and the duplication of the last number in each line.

Let's examine the problem again carefully. The grid pattern is a special one, and the rules for filling out the grid are specific:

- For odd rows, the numbers are filled from left to right.
- For even rows, the numbers are filled from right to left.
- The last number in each row is the same as the number before it.

With these rules, we can deduce the following:

1. The first number on the `k`-th row can be found with the formula: `first_number = 1 + 3 * (k - 1) * k // 2`, because each row adds `k - 1` new numbers plus one duplicate from the previous row.
2. To find the row for a given number `n`, we need to find the smallest `k` such that `n` is less than or equal to the last number on the `k`-th row.

Let's fix the implementation:

```python
def calculate_line(k):
    # Calculate the first number on the line k considering the sequence pattern
    first_number = 1 + 3 * (k - 1) * k // 2
    # Construct the line based on the direction of the fill pattern
    if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd row, numbers increase from left to right
        line = [first_number + i for i in range(5)] + [first_number + 4]
    else:  # Even row, numbers increase from right to left
        line = [first_number + k - 2 - i for i in range(5)] + [first_number + k - 2]
    return line

def find_line_and_col(n):
    # Find the row for the given number n
    k = 1
    while n > 1 + 3 * k * (k + 1) // 2:  # Calculate last number in the k-th row
        k += 1
    # Calculate the first number on the k-th row
    first_number_of_k = 1 + 3 * (k - 1) * k // 2
    # Determine index in the row
    index_in_row = n - first_number_of_k
    # Even rows are reversed
    if k % 2 == 0:
        index_in_row = k - 2 - index_in_row
    # Determine column
    cols = "ABCDEF"
    col = cols[index_in_row % 5]  # use modulo to cycle through columns A-E
    if index_in_row == 4:  # Check if the number is the duplicated one
        col += ' ' + cols[(index_in_row + 1) % 5]
    return k, col

# Read input from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate output values
line_k = calculate_line(k)
line_n, col_n = find_line_and_col(n)

# Write output to file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, line_k)) + '\n')
    fout.write(str(line_n) + '\n')
    fout.write(col_n + '\n')
```

This revised solution should now adhere to the rules of the challenge and output the correct numbers on line `k` and find the correct row and column(s) for the number `n`. The calculations take into account the arithmetic progression for the rows and the specific patterns of duplication and direction reversal.
