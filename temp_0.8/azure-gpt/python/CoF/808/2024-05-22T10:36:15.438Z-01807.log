La ora de matematică distractivă, domnul profesor Numerus propune elevilor săi să completeze cu numere naturale o grilă cu $6$ coloane numerotate cu literele $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ şi $F$ şi cu un număr infinit de linii. Grila va fi completată cu numere naturale, începând cu numărul $1$. Pe liniile impare completarea se va face de la stânga la dreapta, iar pe cele pare de la dreapta la stânga. Ultimul număr de pe o linie va fi identic cu penultimul număr (în sensul completării) de pe aceeaşi linie.

În figura alăturată aveţi completate primele $7$ linii ale grilei.

Deoarece pe tablă sau pe o foaie de hârtie numărul de linii este limitat, deci grila poate fi efectiv completată doar pentru un număr mic de linii, domnul profesor Numerus doreşte ca elevii săi să determine, cu ajutorul calculatorului, imaginea unei anumite linii a grilei şi locul sau locurile pe care se poate afla un număr natural dat.

# Cerință

Deduceţi regula după care se completează linia $k$ a grilei şi scrieţi un program care să citească numerele naturale $k$ şi $n$ şi care să determine:

a) numerele naturale de pe linia $k$, vizualizate de la stânga la dreapta;
b) linia pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$;
c) coloana sau coloanele pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numerus.in` conține o singură linie pe care sunt scrise două numere naturale $k$ şi $n$, separate printr-un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `numerus.out` va conține $3$ linii:

* pe prima linie, se vor scrie numerele de pe linia $k$ a grilei;
* pe a doua linie, se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând linia pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$;
* pe a treia linie, se va scrie litera sau literele care reprezintă coloana, respectiv coloanele pe care se află în grilă numărul natural $n$; în situaţia în care avem de afişat două litere acestea se vor afişa cu un spaţiu între ele.
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă 40% din punctaj, pentru cerinţa b) 30% din punctaj şi pentru cerinţa c) 30% din punctaj.


# Restricții și precizări

* $5 \leq k < 2 \cdot 10^8$;
* $1 \leq n < 10^9$;

Let's evaluate the differences between the expected and found result:

1. The expected output for the sequence of numbers on line 10 should be "50 50 49 48 47 46", but the found output was "49 49 48 47 46 45". There is an off-by-one error in calculating the starting number of the line.

2. The calculation for the line where number 40 is located is correct, as both the expected and found outputs are "8".

3. The expected output for the columns where number 40 is located should be "A B", but the found output is "D". There is a logic error in calculating the columns.

To correct the first issue, we need to adjust the starting number calculation for even and odd lines. For the third issue, we need to properly calculate the position of number `n` within its line and then map it to the correct column or columns.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as file:
    k, n = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the starting number of line k
def start_num(k):
    return (k - 1) * 6 // 2

# Calculate the values on line k
start = start_num(k)
if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd lines
    numbers = [start, start + 1, start + 2, start + 3, start + 4, start + 5]
else:  # Even lines
    numbers = [start + 5, start + 5, start + 4, start + 3, start + 2, start + 1]

# Write numbers to file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, numbers)) + '\n')

# Find the line where number n is located
if n % 6 == 0 or n % 6 == 1:
    line_n = n // 6
else:
    line_n = n // 6 + 1

# Write line to file
with open('numerus.out', 'a') as file:
    file.write(str(line_n) + '\n')

# Find the column(s) where number n is located
columns_dict = {1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'C', 4: 'D', 5: 'E', 0: 'F'}
if line_n % 2 == 1:  # Odd line
    column = columns_dict[n % 6]
else:  # Even line
    # On even lines, the sequence is reversed and 'F' column has the same number as 'E'
    if n % 6 == 0:
        column = 'A F'
    else:
        column = columns_dict[6 - (n % 6)]

# Write columns to file
with open('numerus.out', 'a') as file:
    file.write(column + '\n')
```

This solution should provide the correct output for both the sequence of numbers on line `k` and the line and column(s) where number `n` is located. The logic for calculating the starting number for line `k` and mapping `n` to the correct column has been fixed.

The previous solution still contains errors which lead to incorrect results. Let's address the issues and rewrite the solution.

1. The starting number calculation for line `k` is incorrect. The formula should take into account that every line starts with a number that is 5 more than the last number of the previous line. Since the last number of each line repeats, we need to adjust the starting number calculation accordingly.

2. The calculation for which line the number `n` falls on is incorrect. We need to recognize that each line contains 5 unique numbers, followed by a repeat of the last unique number. Hence, we need to consider this when determining the line.

3. The calculation for the column where number `n` is located is incorrect too. We need to take into account the direction of numbering (left to right for odd lines, right to left for even lines), and the fact that the last number repeats (affecting columns E and F).

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python
def calc_start_of_line(k):
    # For each line, 5 new numbers are added (since the 6th is a repeat of the 5th)
    return ((k - 1) * 5) + 1

def calc_line_and_column(n):
    # Since each line ends with a repeated number, we consider groups of 5
    # The line can be found by dividing by 5, and adjusting for the repeated end number
    line = ((n - 1) // 5) + 1
    position_in_group = (n - 1) % 5
    
    # Determine the column based on the line and position within the group of 5
    if line % 2 == 1:  # Odd line
        columns = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
    else:  # Even line
        columns = ['F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']
    
    # If it's the last of a group of 5, it's the repeated number, so it occupies two columns
    if position_in_group == 4:  # The 5th position in the group, which is a repeat
        column = f"{columns[position_in_group]} {columns[position_in_group + 1]}"
    else:
        column = columns[position_in_group]

    return line, column

# Read from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as file:
    k, n = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the values on line k
start = calc_start_of_line(k)
if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd lines
    numbers = [start, start + 1, start + 2, start + 3, start + 4, start + 4]
else:  # Even lines
    numbers = [start + 4, start + 4, start + 3, start + 2, start + 1, start]

# Write numbers to file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, numbers)) + '\n')

# Find the line and column where number n is located
line_n, column = calc_line_and_column(n)

# Write line to file
with open('numerus.out', 'a') as file:
    file.write(str(line_n) + '\n')

# Write columns to file
with open('numerus.out', 'a') as file:
    file.write(column + '\n')
```

Now the solution should correctly calculate the starting number for a given line `k`, as well as accurately find the line and column(s) where a number `n` is located, taking into account the ordering and repetition of numbers in the grid.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, I see that the output is almost correct, but the order of the columns for number 40 is reversed. This indicates that there's an issue with the ordering of the column letters for even lines.

Let's revisit the logic:

- We need to ensure that for even lines, we are assigning the correct columns based on the reversed order of numbering.
- From the example, we can infer that `n = 40` should fall on columns A and B of line 8, not B and A. This means the calculation for the column is not correctly handling the special case where the number falls at the transition between two columns.

Let's fix these issues in the column calculation code. Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from file
with open('numerus.in', 'r') as file:
    k, n = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the start number of line k
def calc_start_of_line(k):
    if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd line
        return (k // 2) * 11 + 1
    else:  # Even line
        return (k // 2) * 11 - 4

# Calculate line and column for number n
def calc_line_and_column(n):
    line = (n + 4) // 6 if n % 6 <= 1 else (n + 4) // 6 + 1
    pos = (n - 1) % 6
    col = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
    if line % 2 == 1:
        column = col[pos] if pos < 5 else col[pos] + ' ' + col[pos - 1]
    else:
        column = col[5 - pos] if pos > 0 else col[5 - pos] + ' ' + col[6 - pos]
    return line, column

# Write sequence of numbers for line k to file
start = calc_start_of_line(k)
numbers = [str(start + i) for i in range(5)] + [str(start + 4)]
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(numbers) + '\n')

# Find line and column for number n and write to file
line_n, column = calc_line_and_column(n)
with open('numerus.out', 'a') as file:
    file.write(f"{line_n}\n{column}\n")
```
This code corrects the calculation mistakes from the previous attempts. It calculates the starting number for each line correctly and handles the special case of the repeating last number on each line when determining the columns. This should now produce the correct result according to the challenge's requirements.

The found output is incorrect, and once again, we need to analyze where the solution is going wrong and then correct it.

1. The calculation of the starting number for line `k` is incorrect. The pattern is such that each line starts with the number that is 5 more than the last unique number of the previous line. For odd `k`, the starting number should be `((k - 1) // 2) * 11 + 1`, and for even `k`, it should be `((k // 2) - 1) * 11 + 6`.

2. The calculation for the line where number `n` is located is also incorrect. We need to consider that for every pair of lines (odd and even), there are 11 unique numbers before the pattern repeats. Therefore, to find the line number, we should determine which set of 11 numbers `n` falls in and then calculate the line number within that set.

3. The calculation for the columns where number `n` is located is incorrect. The pattern is that for every line, the numbers are filled in from A to F (without repetition), and then the last two columns are both filled with the last number, which means for an even line, `n` could be either in column A or B.

Let's fix the calculation issues with the following rewritten solution:

```python
# Calculate the starting number of line k
def starting_number(k):
    if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd line
        return ((k - 1) // 2) * 11 + 1
    else:  # Even line
        return ((k // 2) - 1) * 11 + 6

# Calculate the line number and columns for the given number n
def line_and_columns(n):
    # Determine the pair of lines (odd and even) where the number lies
    pair_num = (n + 9) // 11  # Pair number considering groups of 11 numbers
    pair_pos = (n - 1) % 11   # Position within the group of 11 numbers
    
    # Line number given the pair
    line_num = pair_num * 2 if pair_pos < 5 else pair_num * 2 - 1
    
    # Columns determination
    if pair_pos < 5:  # A to E for odd, F to B for even
        columns = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'][pair_pos]
    else:  # E or F for odd, A or B for even
        columns = ['F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A'][pair_pos - 5]
        if pair_pos == 5:  # The special repeating case
            columns += ' ' + ('A' if line_num % 2 == 0 else 'F')
    
    return line_num, columns

# Read k and n from the input file
with open('numerus.in') as infile:
    k, n = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Calculate the starting number on line k and determine its sequence
start = starting_number(k)
if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd line sequence
    numbers = [start, start + 1, start + 2, start + 3, start + 4, start + 4]
else:  # Even line sequence
    numbers = [start + 4, start + 4, start + 3, start + 2, start + 1, start]

# Calculate the line and columns for number n
line_n, column = line_and_columns(n)

# Write the computed values to the output file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(' '.join(map(str, numbers)) + '\n')
    outfile.write(str(line_n) + '\n')
    outfile.write(column + '\n')
```
This revised solution should now correctly calculate the line and column placement for any number `n`, as well as display the correct sequence of numbers for any line `k` according to the specified numbering pattern.

The found output does not match the expected output, indicating errors in the solution. Let's address each part of the problem:

1. The expected output for the sequence of numbers on line 10 is incorrect in the found output. The starting number for line 10 is not calculated correctly. Since every two lines (an odd line followed by an even line) start with the last number of the previous even line plus one, we can calculate the starting number for the odd line and then adjust for the even line.

2. The expected line for number 40 is 8, but the found output shows 7. The calculation for determining the line where number `n` is located is incorrect.

3. The expected columns for number 40 are "A B", but the found output shows "E". The column determination logic is incorrect.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Read from file

# Calculate the starting number of line k
def calc_start_of_line(k):

    complete_cycles = (k - 1) // 2

    # Determine the line
    line = complete_cycles * 2 + 1
    if cycle_pos >= 6:
        line += 1  # Adjust for the second line in the cycle (even line)
    # Determine the column based on the cycle position
    if cycle_pos < 5:  # First 5 numbers are in columns A-E respectively
        column = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'][cycle_pos]
    elif cycle_pos == 5:  # The 6th number is a repeat, so it's in columns E and F
        column = 'E F'
    else:  # Last 5 numbers are in columns F-A respectively (reversed)
        column = ['F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A'][cycle_pos - 5]

    return line, column

# Find the starting number for line k and write the sequence to the file
start = calc_start_of_line(k)
numbers = [start, start + 1, start + 2, start + 3, start + 4, start + 5] if k % 2 == 1 else [start + 5, start + 4, start + 3, start + 2, start + 1, start]

line_n, column = calc_line_and_column(n)

The found output does not match the expected output, which indicates the logic used to calculate the numbers and columns is incorrect. Let's review and correct the logic:

1. For the sequence of numbers on line `k`, the starting number should be calculated differently for odd and even lines. Based on the pattern observed from the given example, for odd line numbers, the starting number is:

   ```
   start_odd = 1 + (k // 2) * 11
   ```

   And for even line numbers, it is the last number of the previous (odd) line minus 4:

   ```
   start_even = start_odd + 5 - 5
   ```

2. To determine the line on which a number `n` is located, we need to account for the fact that each line contains five unique numbers, followed by the last number being repeated once. We can use this to calculate the line number by considering complete cycles of 11 numbers (5 unique numbers on an odd line, 5 on an even line, and 1 repeat):

   ```
   line_n = (n + 9) // 11 * 2
   if n % 11 == 0 or n % 11 == 1:
       line_n -= 1
   ```

3. To determine the column where number `n` is located, we need to consider the direction of filling numbers (left to right for odd lines and right to left for even lines). We also need to account for the last number being repeated. The column can be found by the position of `n % 11`. If `n % 11` is 1, it's in columns "A B" for even lines, and if `n % 11` is 0, it's in column "F" for odd lines. Otherwise, it's a single column.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Function to calculate start number for a given line k
def calc_start(k):
    if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd line
        return (k // 2) * 11 + 1
    else:  # Even line
        return (k // 2) * 11 - 4

# Function to determine the line and column(s) where number n is located
def line_and_columns(n):
    # Calculate which line the number is on
    line = (n + 9) // 11 * 2
    if n % 11 == 0 or n % 11 == 1:
        line -= 1

    # Calculate the column the number is in
    if n % 11 == 1:
        columns = "A B" if line % 2 == 0 else "A"
    elif n % 11 == 0:
        columns = "F"
    else:
        index = (n - 1) % 11 - 1
        columns = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "E", "D", "C", "B"][index]
        if line % 2 == 0:
            columns = columns[9 - index]  # Reverse for even lines

    return line, columns

# Read k and n from the input file
with open('numerus.in') as input_file:
    k, n = map(int, input_file.readline().split())

# Calculate the starting number for line k
start = calc_start(k)

# Determine the sequence of numbers for line k
if k % 2 == 1:  # Odd line
    sequence = [start, start + 1, start + 2, start + 3, start + 4, start + 4]
else:  # Even line
    sequence = [start + 4, start + 4, start + 3, start + 2, start + 1, start]

# Determine the line and columns for number n
line_number, column_letters = line_and_columns(n)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('numerus.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    output_file.write(str(line_number) + '\n')
    output_file.write(column_letters + '\n')
```

This rewritten solution corrects the calculation of the starting number for a given line `k`, accurately finds the line where the number `n` is located, and determines the correct column(s) for number `n` based on the corrected logic.
