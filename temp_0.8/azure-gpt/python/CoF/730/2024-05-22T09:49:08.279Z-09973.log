Jocul “Nu te supăra, frate!” se joacă de către doi jucatori. Pe o pistă circulară cu $n$ căsuţe numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, în ordinea dată de sensul acelor de ceasornic, se află înscrise valorile $0, 1$ şi $10$. Cei doi jucători vor avea fiecare câte un pion şi vor porni pe rând, din căsuţa $1$. Începe jucătorul $1$. Fiecare jucător va muta pionul său conform cu valoarea obţinută prin aruncarea zarului, cumulând sau pierzând puncte în funcţie de căsuţa în care ajunge. Fiecare jucător citeşte valoarea zarului când îi vine rândul.

Jocul are urmatoarele reguli:
1. Câştigătorul poate fi:
	- jucătorul care ajunge primul din nou în căsuţa cu numărul $1$, indiferent de punctaj (exceptând cazul în care are punctaj $0$)
	- în cazul în care se termină şirul aruncărilor cu zarul, înseamnă că jucătorii s-au plictisit şi câştigă cel care a cumulat mai multe puncte, iar dacă au punctaje egale câştigă cel care se află în căsuţa cu număr de ordine mai mare.
2. După aruncarea zarului, jucătorul mută pionul cu atâtea căsuţe cât indică valoarea zarului, în ordinea acelor de ceasornic, începând numărătoarea cu căsuţa următoare poziţiei pe care se află. Prima căsuţă nu conţine valoarea $0$ (zero).
3. După mutare pot apare următoarele situaţii:
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $0$ (zero) – jucătorul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele acumulate şi reia jocul din pozitia $1$
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $10$ – primeşte un bonus de $10$ puncte
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $1$ – primeşte $1$ punct
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă în care se află celălalt pion (cu excepţia căsuţei $1$, când câştigă) – jucătorul care ajunge ultimul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele şi reia jocul de la căsuţa $1$.

# Cerință

Determinaţi jucătorul câştigător, poziţiile fiecărui jucător pe cerc şi punctajul fiecărui jucător.

# Date de intrare

În fişierul `joc.in` se dau:
- Pe prima linie numărul $n$ al casutelor din cerc.
- Linia a doua conţine o succesiune de $n$ valori ($0, 1$ sau $10$), separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând valoarea fiecărei căsuţe.
- Linia a treia conţine numărul de aruncări cu zarul
- Linia a patra conţine o succesiune de valori întregi cuprinse între $1$ şi $6$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând aruncarea cu zarul. 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `joc.out` va conţine $3$ linii cu următoarele informaţii:
- pe prima linie: jucătorul câştigător
- pe a doua linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $1$.
- pe a treia linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $2$.

After reviewing the program against the expected output, it appears there's a mistake in the rules for when the player lands on the opponent's position. The rules state that the player who arrives later is penalized, but in the current implementation, the player moving to the new position is penalized without verifying if the opponent is already there. 

Also, the current logic for determining the winner when the dice throws are exhausted is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the scenario where the scores are equal, in which case the player in the position with the highest number wins.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read the input from joc.in
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    num_throws = int(file.readline().strip())
    throws = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the game state
positions = [1, 1]  # Start positions for player 1 and 2
scores = [0, 0]  # Initial scores for player 1 and 2
winner = None

# Simulate the game
for i in range(num_throws):
    player = i % 2
    throw = throws[i]

    # Calculate new position
    new_position = (positions[player] + throw - 1) % n + 1

    # Check if the player lands on the opponent
    if new_position == positions[1 - player]:
        # Penalize the player already there if it's not the starting position
        if new_position != 1:
            scores[1 - player] = 0
            positions[1 - player] = 1

    # Check if the player lands on a zero
    if board[new_position - 1] == 0:
        scores[player] = 0
        positions[player] = 1
    else:
        # Update the score and the position
        scores[player] += board[new_position - 1]
        positions[player] = new_position

    # Check if the player wins by reaching position 1 (except if the score is zero)
    if positions[player] == 1 and scores[player] > 0:
        winner = player + 1
        break

# Determine the winner if not already set
if winner is None:
    if scores[0] > scores[1] or (scores[0] == scores[1] and positions[0] > positions[1]):
        winner = 1
    elif scores[1] > scores[0] or (scores[0] == scores[1] and positions[1] > positions[0]):
        winner = 2

# Write the output to joc.out
with open('joc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{winner}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[0]} {scores[0]}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[1]} {scores[1]}\n')
```

This revised solution should now correctly handle the scenario when a player lands on the opponent's position, penalize the correct player, and determine the winner correctly at the end of all dice throws.

After reviewing the input, expected output, and the current solution, I've identified the bug in the program. The issue lies with the player collision handling logic. The program currently penalizes the player who was already on the spot when the other player lands on the same position. However, this is not what the game rules specify for the starting position (position 1), as there is no penalty when a player reaches the starting position.

I will fix the collision handling logic so that when a player lands on a spot occupied by the opponent, the opponent is penalized, unless it's the starting position. Furthermore, I will also properly handle the scenario where the dice rolls are exhausted, and the players have equal scores.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
# Read the input from joc.in
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    num_throws = int(file.readline().strip())
    throw_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the game state
positions = [1, 1]  # Start positions for player 1 and 2
scores = [0, 0]  # Initial scores for player 1 and 2
current_player = 0  # Start with player 1

# Simulate the game
for throw in throw_values:
    # Calculate the new position
    positions[current_player] = (positions[current_player] - 1 + throw) % n + 1
    current_value = board_values[positions[current_player] - 1]

    # Check for landing on the other player, unless it's the starting position
    if positions[current_player] != 1 and positions[current_player] == positions[(current_player + 1) % 2]:
        scores[(current_player + 1) % 2] = 0
        positions[(current_player + 1) % 2] = 1

    # Landing on zero, player loses all points and goes back to the start
    if current_value == 0:
        scores[current_player] = 0
        positions[current_player] = 1
    else:
        scores[current_player] += current_value

    # Check if the player wins by reaching the first position with a non-zero score
    if positions[current_player] == 1 and scores[current_player] > 0:
        break

    # Switch to the next player
    current_player = (current_player + 1) % 2

# Determine the winner
if scores[0] > scores[1]:
    winner = 1
elif scores[0] < scores[1]:
    winner = 2
else:  # Scores are equal, check the positions
    if positions[0] == 1 and positions[1] != 1:
        winner = 1
    elif positions[1] == 1 and positions[0] != 1:
        winner = 2
    else:
        winner = 1 if positions[0] > positions[1] else 2

# Write the output to joc.out
with open('joc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{winner}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[0]} {scores[0]}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[1]} {scores[1]}\n')
```

This revised solution should correctly handle collision cases and determine the winner based on the final scores and positions according to the rules.

The exit code 125 and the error message are not related to the Python code itself, but rather indicate an issue with the container or environment in which the Python code is being executed. The message "cannot start a stopped process: unknown" suggests that there is a problem with the Docker container.

Since I cannot address the Docker environment directly, I will provide the corrected Python solution again, assuming that the environment issues will be resolved separately. Here is the revised Python code:

```python
# Read the input from joc.in
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    num_throws = int(file.readline().strip())
    throw_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the game state
positions = [1, 1]  # Start positions for player 1 and 2
scores = [0, 0]    # Initial scores for player 1 and 2
current_player = 0  # Start with player 1
winner = None       # No winner yet

# Simulate the game
for throw in throw_values:
    # Calculate the new position
    positions[current_player] = (positions[current_player] + throw - 1) % n + 1
    current_value = board_values[positions[current_player] - 1]

    # Check for collision except at the starting position
    if positions[current_player] != 1 and positions[current_player] == positions[1 - current_player]:
        scores[1 - current_player] = 0
        positions[1 - current_player] = 1
        
    # Apply rules based on the board value
    if current_value == 0:
        scores[current_player] = 0
        positions[current_player] = 1
    else:
        scores[current_player] += current_value

    # Check for a winner who has reached the starting position with a non-zero score
    if positions[current_player] == 1 and scores[current_player] > 0:
        winner = current_player + 1
        break

    # Switch to the next player
    current_player = 1 - current_player

# If no winner yet, determine based on scores and positions
if winner is None:
    if scores[0] > scores[1]:
        winner = 1
    elif scores[1] > scores[0]:
        winner = 2
    elif positions[0] == 1:
        winner = 1
    elif positions[1] == 1:
        winner = 2
    else:
        winner = 1 if positions[0] > positions[1] else 2

# Write the output to joc.out
with open('joc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{winner}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[0]} {scores[0]}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[1]} {scores[1]}\n')
```

This code is now updated to correctly handle collisions (other than at the starting position) and determine the winner at the end of the game. It should also avoid the previous bugs related to the determination of the winner when scores are equal. Please make sure the Docker environment issue is resolved so that the corrected code can run successfully.

Upon analyzing the situation again, it seems there is an issue with the way the program calculates the final positions and scores, especially when handling the players' collisions and the penalization rule. We need to make sure only the player who lands on an occupied space gets penalized, except if it's the starting position.

Let's re-evaluate the loop that simulates the game moves:

1. We need to update the position based on the throw.
2. If a player lands on a position occupied by the opponent, and it's not the starting position, the player who was already there is penalized.
3. If a player lands on a position with a value of zero, they lose their points and return to the starting position.
4. If the player lands back on the starting position with a non-zero score, they win.
5. If all throws are used without a player winning by reaching the starting position, the winner is determined by the higher score, or by the higher position number if the scores are equal.

I will now implement the necessary fixes to the program:

```python
# Read the input from joc.in
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    num_throws = int(file.readline().strip())
    throw_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the game state
positions = [1, 1]  # Start positions for player 1 and 2
scores = [0, 0]    # Initial scores for player 1 and 2

# Simulate the game
for i, throw in enumerate(throw_values):
    current_player = i % 2
    next_position = (positions[current_player] + throw - 1) % n + 1

    # Check for collision except at the starting position
    if next_position != 1 and next_position == positions[1 - current_player]:
        scores[current_player] = 0
        positions[current_player] = 1
    else:
        # Apply the board value effects
        if board_values[next_position - 1] == 0:
            scores[current_player] = 0
            positions[current_player] = 1
        else:
            scores[current_player] += board_values[next_position - 1]
            positions[current_player] = next_position

        # Check for a win by reaching the starting position with a non-zero score
        if next_position == 1 and scores[current_player] > 0:
            break

# Determining the winner if there is no win by reaching the start position
if positions[0] != 1 and positions[1] != 1:
    if scores[0] > scores[1]:
        winner = 1
    elif scores[1] > scores[0]:
        winner = 2
    else:
        winner = 1 if positions[0] > positions[1] else 2
else:
    winner = 1 if positions[0] == 1 else 2

# Write the output to joc.out
with open('joc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{winner}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[0]} {scores[0]}\n')
    file.write(f'{positions[1]} {scores[1]}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly handle the game's rules and produce the expected output. The program ensures that only the arriving player is penalized for a collision (unless it's the starting position), and it correctly identifies the winner based on the game's end state.
