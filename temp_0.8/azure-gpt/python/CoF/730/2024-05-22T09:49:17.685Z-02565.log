Jocul “Nu te supăra, frate!” se joacă de către doi jucatori. Pe o pistă circulară cu $n$ căsuţe numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, în ordinea dată de sensul acelor de ceasornic, se află înscrise valorile $0, 1$ şi $10$. Cei doi jucători vor avea fiecare câte un pion şi vor porni pe rând, din căsuţa $1$. Începe jucătorul $1$. Fiecare jucător va muta pionul său conform cu valoarea obţinută prin aruncarea zarului, cumulând sau pierzând puncte în funcţie de căsuţa în care ajunge. Fiecare jucător citeşte valoarea zarului când îi vine rândul.

Jocul are urmatoarele reguli:
1. Câştigătorul poate fi:
	- jucătorul care ajunge primul din nou în căsuţa cu numărul $1$, indiferent de punctaj (exceptând cazul în care are punctaj $0$)
	- în cazul în care se termină şirul aruncărilor cu zarul, înseamnă că jucătorii s-au plictisit şi câştigă cel care a cumulat mai multe puncte, iar dacă au punctaje egale câştigă cel care se află în căsuţa cu număr de ordine mai mare.
2. După aruncarea zarului, jucătorul mută pionul cu atâtea căsuţe cât indică valoarea zarului, în ordinea acelor de ceasornic, începând numărătoarea cu căsuţa următoare poziţiei pe care se află. Prima căsuţă nu conţine valoarea $0$ (zero).
3. După mutare pot apare următoarele situaţii:
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $0$ (zero) – jucătorul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele acumulate şi reia jocul din pozitia $1$
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $10$ – primeşte un bonus de $10$ puncte
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $1$ – primeşte $1$ punct
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă în care se află celălalt pion (cu excepţia căsuţei $1$, când câştigă) – jucătorul care ajunge ultimul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele şi reia jocul de la căsuţa $1$.

# Cerință

Determinaţi jucătorul câştigător, poziţiile fiecărui jucător pe cerc şi punctajul fiecărui jucător.

# Date de intrare

În fişierul `joc.in` se dau:
- Pe prima linie numărul $n$ al casutelor din cerc.
- Linia a doua conţine o succesiune de $n$ valori ($0, 1$ sau $10$), separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând valoarea fiecărei căsuţe.
- Linia a treia conţine numărul de aruncări cu zarul
- Linia a patra conţine o succesiune de valori întregi cuprinse între $1$ şi $6$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând aruncarea cu zarul. 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `joc.out` va conţine $3$ linii cu următoarele informaţii:
- pe prima linie: jucătorul câştigător
- pe a doua linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $1$.
- pe a treia linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $2$.

The found output does not match the expected output because of a bug in the logic that handles the case when a player lands on a space occupied by the other player. Specifically, the condition to reset the other player is incorrectly placed within the scope that handles the addition of points, so it only resets the other player if the current player did not land on a zero-value space. Additionally, the winning condition is incorrectly checked after score addition and player resetting, which can lead to an incorrect winner if a player lands on the starting position with a score greater than zero.

I will adjust the code to fix the bug by ensuring that the check for landing on the opposing player is done immediately after position calculation and before any point addition or zero checks. Moreover, I will move the winning condition check to the correct place.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    num_rolls = int(file.readline().strip())
    rolls = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

players = [(1, 0), (1, 0)]  # (position, score) for each player
winner = 0
current_player = 0

for roll in rolls:
    position, score = players[current_player]
    position = (position - 1 + roll) % n + 1  # move player

    # Check if player lands on same position as the opponent (not in starting position)
    if position == players[1 - current_player][0] and position != 1:
        players[1 - current_player] = (1, 0)  # reset the opponent

    # Check for landing on zero after potentially resetting the opponent
    if board_values[position - 1] == 0:
        position, score = 1, 0
    else:
        score += board_values[position - 1]

    # Update player position and score
    players[current_player] = (position, score)
    
    # Check for a winning condition
    if position == 1 and score > 0:
        winner = current_player + 1
        break

    # Switch to the other player
    current_player = 1 - current_player

# Determine the winner if not already found

It looks like there is a mistake in the logic that resets the score of the player who lands on the same position as the opponent. According to the game rules, this should only happen if the current player lands on a position already occupied by the other player, but not on the starting position (position 1). The current implementation does not properly handle this case.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes to ensure that:

1. When a player lands on the same position as the opponent (except for the starting position), the opponent's score is reset and they start from position 1.
2. The condition to check for the winning player is correct and occurs after each move.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    num_rolls = int(file.readline().strip())
    rolls = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

players = [(1, 0), (1, 0)]  # (position, score) for each player
winner = 0
current_player = 0

for roll in rolls:
    position, score = players[current_player]
    position = (position - 1 + roll) % n + 1  # Calculate new position

    # Check for collision with the other player (except at the start position)
    if position == players[1 - current_player][0] and position != 1:
        players[1 - current_player] = (1, 0)  # Reset the other player

    # Landing on a zero-value space resets the player's score
    if board_values[position - 1] == 0:
        score = 0

    # Add the board value to the player's score (unless the player was reset to zero)
    if score != 0 or board_values[position - 1] != 0:
        score += board_values[position - 1]

    # Update the player's position and score
    players[current_player] = (position, score)
    
    # Check for the winning condition
    if position == 1 and score > 0:
        winner = current_player + 1
        break

    # Switch players
    current_player = 1 - current_player

# Determine the winner based on the scores and positions if the game ended without a win by returning to position 1
if winner == 0:
    if players[0][1] == players[1][1]:
        winner = 1 if players[0][0] > players[1][0] else 2
    else:
        winner = 1 if players[0][1] > players[1][1] else 2

with open('joc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{winner}\n")
    file.write(f"{players[0][0]} {players[0][1]}\n")
    file.write(f"{players[1][0]} {players[1][1]}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now respect all the rules provided for the game, including resetting the score of a player when landing on the same position as the opponent (except for the starting position). It also ensures that the winner is determined based on the condition of returning to the start position with a score greater than zero or based on the highest score if no player has won by reaching the start. If the scores are tied, the player with the higher position number wins.

Upon re-evaluating the game rules and the sample input/output, it's become apparent that the way the game is supposed to be played was misinterpreted in the solution provided. The main issue with the previous solution seems to be the handling of the situation when a player lands on a space with another player's piece, except for the starting position.

The rules specify that if a player lands on the same space as the other player (other than the starting position), the player who lands last is penalized by losing all their points and being sent back to the start. The previous solution incorrectly reset the other player instead of the current one.

Let's correct the solution based on the rules:

```python
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board_values = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    num_rolls = int(file.readline().strip())
    rolls = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize positions and scores for both players
players = [(1, 0), (1, 0)]
winner = 0

# Play the game
for i, roll in enumerate(rolls):
    current_player = i % 2
    opponent_player = (i + 1) % 2
    position, score = players[current_player]

    # Move the player
    position = (position - 1 + roll) % n + 1

    # Check for the player landing on the opponent's position (except the start position)
    if position == players[opponent_player][0] and position != 1:
        # Current player is penalized and sent back to the start
        position, score = 1, 0
    else:
        # Update score based on board value
        if board_values[position - 1] == 0:
            # Player landed on a zero-value space, loses all points
            score = 0
        else:
            # Player receives board value as points
            score += board_values[position - 1]

    players[current_player] = (position, score)

    # Check if the current player has won by returning to start with a non-zero score
    if position == 1 and score > 0:
        winner = current_player + 1
        break

# Determine the winner based on scores if no one has won by returning to start
if winner == 0:
    if players[0][1] > players[1][1]:
        winner = 1
    elif players[0][1] < players[1][1]:
        winner = 2
    else:
        # If scores are equal, the player with the higher position wins
        winner = 1 if players[0][0] > players[1][0] else 2

# Write the result to the output file
with open('joc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{winner}\n")
    file.write(f"{players[0][0]} {players[0][1]}\n")
    file.write(f"{players[1][0]} {players[1][1]}\n")
```

This corrected solution addresses the rules properly and should provide the expected output by correctly penalizing the player who lands on a space occupied by the opponent (other than the start position) and by determining the winner based on the rules given.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output is likely due to an error in how scores are calculated when a player lands on a given square. Specifically, it seems the found output is applying the score bonus from the board incorrectly when a player lands on the starting square (position 1) after going around the board. 

Let's reimplement the solution to correctly handle the scoring and implement the following rules:
- If a player lands on a square with a value of 0, all points are lost and the player moves back to position 1.
- If a player lands on a square with a value of 10, they receive 10 points.
- If a player lands on a square occupied by the opposing player, but it's not the starting square, the current player loses all their points and is moved back to position 1.
- The game ends when a player lands back on position 1 with a non-zero score, or after all dice rolls are completed.
- The winner is the player with the highest score, or if the scores are equal, the player with the higher position wins.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('joc.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    board_values = [int(x) for x in file.readline().strip().split()]
    num_rolls = int(file.readline().strip())
    rolls = [int(x) for x in file.readline().strip().split()]

# Initialize positions and scores for both players
players = [(1, 0), (1, 0)]  # (position, score)
current_player = 0

# Play the game
for roll in rolls:
    pos, score = players[current_player]
    # Move the player and correct for 1-based indexing
    pos = (pos - 1 + roll) % n + 1

    # Handle landing on the same spot, not the starting point
    if pos == players[1 - current_player][0] and pos != 1:
        pos, score = 1, 0  # Current player resets
    else:  # Apply board values or reset if landed on zero
        if board_values[pos - 1] == 0:
            pos, score = 1, 0
        else:
            score += board_values[pos - 1]

    # Update player's status
    players[current_player] = (pos, score)

    # Winning condition: returning to start with non-zero score
    if pos == 1 and score > 0:
        winner = current_player + 1
        break

    # Switch players
    current_player = 1 - current_player

# Determine the winner if no one has won by returning to start
if 'winner' not in locals():  # Check if winner variable is not set
    if players[0][1] > players[1][1]:
        winner = 1
    elif players[0][1] < players[1][1]:
        winner = 2
    else:
        winner = 2 if players[0][0] < players[1][0] else 1

# Write the result to the output file
with open('joc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{winner}\n")
    file.write(f"{players[0][0]} {players[0][1]}\n")
    file.write(f"{players[1][0]} {players[1][1]}\n")
```

This implementation should provide the correct behavior as per the game rules and produce the expected output.
