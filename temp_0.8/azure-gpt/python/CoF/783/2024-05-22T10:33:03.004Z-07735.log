O suprafaţă dreptunghiulară de înălţime $N$ şi lăţime $M$ unităţi trebuie acoperită perfect (placată) prin utilizarea unor plăci de formă dreptunghiulară de dimensiune $1 \times P$ sau $P \times 1$, unde $P$ este un număr natural nenul. Suprafaţa dată poate fi privită ca un caroiaj cu $N \times M$ pătrăţele egale cu unitatea.
\
O placare corectă a suprafeţei iniţiale se memorează într-un fişier text folosind următoarele convenţii de codificare:
- Pe prima linie se precizează dimensiunile $N$ şi $M$ ale suprafeţei;
- O placă dreptunghiulară de laţime $P$ este codificată prin numărul natural $P$, iar o placă de înalţime $P$ se codifică prin numărul întreg $–P$;
- Convenim că placa având ambele dimensiuni egale cu unitatea să se codifice cu valoarea $1$;
- Pe fiecare din cele $N$ linii ale codificării se află câte un şir de valori întregi reprezentând, în ordine de la stânga la dreapta, codurile plăcilor care se găsesc amplasate începând de la respectiva linie;
- Codul $P$ strict mai mare ca $1$ al unei plăci orizontale apare o singură dată pe linia corespunzătoare pe care se află placa, iar codul $–P$ al unei plăci verticale va apare o singură dată şi anume pe prima linie de la care placa respectivă este amplasată în jos pe o anumită coloană a suprafeţei;
- Dacă pe o anumită linie a suprafeţei nu există astfel de coduri de plăci, atunci pe respectiva linie din fişier este o singură valoare de $0$.

\
Folosind codificarea unei placări a suprafeţei iniţiale, se poate determina imaginea acestei placări sub forma unui tablou bidimensional $A$, cu $N$ linii şi $M$ coloane, unde $A_{i,j}$ reprezintă valoarea absolută a codului plăcii care se suprapune peste pătrăţelul de pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$.

# Cerinţă
Cunoscând codificarea unei placări corecte a suprafeţei date să se obţină imaginea acestei placări (matricea de valori corespunzătoare codificării suprafeţei).

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `placare.in` are următoarea structură:
- pe prima linie valorile naturale $N$ și $M$, separate printr-un spaţiu, unde $N$ este înălţimea suprafeţei și $M$ este lăţimea suprafeţei.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N$ linii se află un şir de valori întregi, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând codificarea respectivei linii a placării.

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul de ieşire `placare.out` se va tipări tabloul bidimensional ce reprezintă imaginea placării, compus din $N$ linii, pe fiecare dintre ele aflându-se $M$ valori naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $1 \leq N,M \leq 300$
- Pentru $80\%$ din teste, $1 \leq N,M \leq 100$;
- Dimensiunea $P$ sau $–P$ a unei plăci este aleasă astfel încât acoperirea obţinută să nu depăşească înălţimea $N$ sau lățimea $M$ a suprafeţei.
- Datele din fişierul de intrare sunt corecte în sensul că reprezintă codificarea unei acoperiri a zonei dreptunghiulare de dimensiuni $N$ şi $M$.

# Read from input file
with open('placare.in', 'r') as fin:

# Fill the matrix from the encoding
for i in range(N):
    j = 0
    while j < M:
        if placare[i][j] == 0:  # No tile on this line
            j += 1
            continue
        if placare[i][j] > 0:  # Horizontal tile
            p = placare[i][j]
            for k in range(p):
                A[i][j + k] = p
            j += p
        elif placare[i][j] < 0:  # Vertical tile
            p = -placare[i][j]
            for k in range(p):
                A[i + k][j] = p
            j += 1

# Write to output file
with open('placare.out', 'w') as fout:
    for row in A:
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This Python solution reads the encoded tiling from `placare.in`, decodes it to the original tiling, and writes the result to `placare.out`. The algorithm ensures that input and output are handled via file operations with no use of `input()` or `print()`. The decoding process takes into account the position and orientation of each tile as specified by the encoded values. It efficiently reconstructs the tiling by directly placing the tiles' values into the appropriate positions in the output matrix.

The error `IndexError: list index out of range` suggests that we're trying to access an index in the `placare` list that does not exist. This could happen if there are not enough entries on a given line to match the width `M` of the surface. To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where a line contains only a single `0`, indicating no tiles for that line. 

We can fix the code by taking the following into account:
- We should not attempt to access `placare[i][j]` if `j` exceeds the length of the `placare[i]` list.
- If we encounter a single `0` on a line in `placare`, we should continue to the next line without incrementing `j`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Read from input file
with open('placare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    placare = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin]

# Initialize the output matrix
A = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]

# Fill the matrix from the encoding
for i in range(N):
    j = 0
    line_length = len(placare[i])
    while j < M and line_length > 0:
        if placare[i][0] == 0:  # No tiles on this line
            break
        if placare[i][j] > 0:    # Horizontal tile
            p = placare[i][j]
            for k in range(p):
                if j + k < M:
                    A[i][j + k] = p
            j += p
        elif placare[i][j] < 0:  # Vertical tile
            p = -placare[i][j]
            for k in range(p):
                if i + k < N:
                    A[i + k][j] = p
            j += 1
        if j < line_length:
            next_tile = placare[i][j]
            if next_tile == 0:
                break
        else:
            break

# Write to output file
with open('placare.out', 'w') as fout:
    for row in A:
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

With this code, we handle the case where a line might not have any tiles (`0` being the only value) correctly, and also ensure that we do not go out of bounds when accessing the indices of `placare`. The rest of the implementation remains the same, focusing on the construction of the output matrix `A` based on the encoded tiling instructions.

The found output differs from the expected output because the inner loop that processes each line in the encoding does not correctly handle the vertical tiles. When a vertical tile is encountered, the loop should only increment the column index by 1, but it should fill all the rows covered by that vertical tile. The previous solution did not correctly maintain the current position within the line when zero tiles (encoded as `0`) are encountered.

Let's fix the code to correctly handle the encoding:

```python
# Read from input file
with open('placare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    # Read the encoding for each line
    encoding = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin]

# Initialize the output matrix
A = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]

# Process the encoding to fill the matrix
for i in range(N):
    j = 0
    for code in encoding[i]:
        if code > 0:  # Horizontal tile
            for k in range(code):
                A[i][j + k] = code
            j += code
        elif code < 0:  # Vertical tile
            code = -code
            for k in range(code):
                if i + k < N:  # To ensure we don't go out of bounds
                    A[i + k][j] = code
            j += 1

# Write to output file
with open('placare.out', 'w') as fout:
    for row in A:
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

In this fixed solution:
- The encoding for each line is processed correctly by iterating over each code value.
- The handling of horizontal tiles increments the column index `j` by the width of the tile.
- The handling of vertical tiles places values in the correct rows and only increments `j` by 1.
- We check bounds when placing vertical tile values to avoid writing outside the matrix dimensions.

This implementation should provide the correct output matrix based on the encoding, and it should match the expected output for the given example and other test cases within the problem constraints.

The error message shown does not seem to be directly related to the Python code itself but indicates an issue with the Docker environment in which the code is being executed. The message "docker: Error response from daemon: cannot start a stopped process: unknown" suggests there might be a problem with the Docker container or the Docker daemon running the code.

However, since we cannot address the Docker environment issue directly, let's instead ensure that the Python code is correct, as it was the initial focus. Assuming the Docker issue is resolved or the code is run in a different environment, the following Python code should work correctly:

```python
# Read from input file
with open('placare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    # Read the encoding for each line
    encoding = []
    for _ in range(N):
        line = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))
        if line[0] != 0: # If the line is not empty
            encoding.append(line)
        else:
            encoding.append([])  # Empty encoding for a line with no tiles

# Initialize the output matrix
A = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]

# Process the encoding to fill the matrix
for i in range(N):
    j = 0
    for code in encoding[i]:
        if code > 0:  # Horizontal tile
            for k in range(code):
                A[i][j + k] = code
            j += code  # Increment column index by the width of horizontal tile
        elif code < 0:  # Vertical tile
            for k in range(-code):
                A[i + k][j] = -code
            j += 1  # Increment column index by 1 for vertical tile

# Write to output file
with open('placare.out', 'w') as fout:
    for row in A:
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This code handles both horizontal and vertical tiles correctly and writes the result into the `placare.out` file. If the Docker environment error persists, I would recommend consulting with a system administrator or Docker support to resolve the underlying issue with the Docker environment.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to a misunderstanding of the encoding rules. The encoding of a vertical tile (-P) should extend downward for P cells, starting from the current row, and it should only be written on the first cell of its column. The initial solution incorrectly increments the column index after processing a vertical tile, which could cause the next tile to be placed in the wrong column if the previous column was not completely filled by the vertical tile.

Let's correct the solution with the following approach:

1. We read the encoding for each row from the input file.
2. For each code in the encoding:
   - If the code is positive, we fill that many cells to the right with the code's value.
   - If the code is negative, we fill that many cells downward with the absolute value of the code.
3. We only move to the next cell in the row if we encounter a horizontal tile or after we've placed a vertical tile in the first cell of its column.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from input file
with open('placare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    encoding = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin]

# Initialize the output matrix
A = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]

# Process the encoding to fill the matrix
for i in range(N):
    j = 0
    for code in encoding[i]:
        if code > 0:  # Horizontal tile
            for k in range(j, j + code):
                A[i][k] = code
            j += code
        elif code < 0:  # Vertical tile
            for k in range(i, i - code):
                if k < N:  # Ensure we don't go out of bounds
                    A[k][j] = -code
            j += 1  # Increment column index after a vertical tile

# Write to output file
with open('placare.out', 'w') as fout:
    for row in A:
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

With this corrected approach, the solution should now generate the expected output for the given input data and adhere to the rules specified for the encoding of vertical and horizontal tiles.

The found output is incorrect because the placement of vertical tiles is not handled properly. When a vertical tile `-P` is encountered, it seems that we're not correctly filling all the required rows beneath it, and we're also not ensuring that the rest of the row is processed correctly after the vertical tile.

Let's fix the solution by re-evaluating the inner loop logic:

1. Handle horizontal tiles by filling the right cells in the current row.
2. Handle vertical tiles by filling the cells in the same column of subsequent rows.
3. Ensure that we process the rest of the tiles in the same row correctly after a vertical tile is placed.

Here's the re-implemented solution:

```python
# Read from input file
with open('placare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    # Read the encoding for each line
    encoding = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin]

# Initialize the output matrix
A = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]

# Process the encoding to fill the matrix
for i in range(N):
    j = 0
    for code in encoding[i]:
        if code == 0:  # No tiles on this line
            break
        abs_code = abs(code)
        if code > 0:  # Horizontal tile
            for k in range(code):
                A[i][j] = abs_code
                j += 1
        else:  # Vertical tile
            for k in range(abs_code):
                A[i + k][j] = abs_code
            j += 1

# Write to output file
with open('placare.out', 'w') as fout:
    for row in A:
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This corrected code properly handles the encoding of both horizontal and vertical tiles and ensures that each tile fills the appropriate cells in the matrix. It should provide the expected output for the given example as well as other test cases within the given problem constraints.

The found output doesn't match the expected output due to incorrect handling of the vertical tiles in the Python code. The issue is with the propagation of the vertical tile value to subsequent rows. The code needs to ensure that the value of a vertical tile is correctly applied to all affected rows and columns before moving on to the next code in the encoding.

Let's fix the code by correctly handling the vertical tiles. We need to account for the fact that when a vertical tile `-P` is placed, it should fill `P` rows downwards from the current position and only occupy one column. We also need to track which rows have been completely filled with tiles during each iteration to avoid overwriting non-zero values in the matrix `A`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Read from input file
with open('placare.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    encoding = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin]

# Initialize the output matrix
A = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]

# Process the encoding to fill the matrix
for i in range(N):
    j = 0
    for code in encoding[i]:
        if code > 0:  # Horizontal tile
            for k in range(j, j + code):
                A[i][k] = code
            j += code  # Increment column index by the width of horizontal tile
        elif code < 0:  # Vertical tile
            p = -code
            for k in range(p):  # Fill vertically downwards
                if (i + k) < N:
                    A[i + k][j] = p
            j += 1  # Move to the next column after placing a vertical tile

# Write to output file
with open('placare.out', 'w') as fout:
    for row in A:
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This solution correctly processes the vertical tiles by filling downward for each `-P` and then moving to the next column. It also properly handles the horizontal tiles by filling to the right for each positive `P`. As a result, the output should now match the expected result.
