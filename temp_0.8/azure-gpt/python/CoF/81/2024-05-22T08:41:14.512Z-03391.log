Dezamăgiți de lipsa fotbalului din ultima perioadă, Ștefan și Georgian și-au deschis (în secret) o afacere cu boabe de cafea, comercializând $K$ tipuri diferite de cafea. Astfel, timp de $N$ zile ei produc cafea, urmând să formeze din boabele obținute în zile **consecutive** pachete ce conțin **toate** tipurile de cafea.

Concret, cei doi știu pentru fiecare zi ce tipuri de cafea produc în acea zi (posibil niciun tip, caz în care afacerea ia o pauză), după care ei împart zilele în secvențe continue astfel încât, pentru fiecare tip de cafea, fiecare secvență de zile să conțină cel puțin o zi în care să fie produs acel tip de cafea.

# Cerință
Înainte de a se apuca de împachetat boabele, Ștefan și Georgian își pun două întrebări:

1. Care este numărul maxim de pachete ce pot fi formate?
2. Care este numărul de moduri de a împărți zilele astfel încât să se formeze număr maxim de pachete valide (ce conțin toate tipurile de cafea)?

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsește un număr întreg $P$, reprezentând numărul cerinței de rezolvat.
Pe cea de-a doua linie se găsește un număr întreg $T$, reprezentând numărul de scenarii pentru care va trebui să rezolvați problema.
Urmează cele $T$ instanțe ale problemei, fiecare fiind compusă din $N + 1$ linii: pe prima linie se vor afla două numere întregi $N$ și $K$, reprezentând numărul de zile, respectiv numărul de tipuri diferite de cafea; pe următoarele $N$ linii câte $K$ cifre binare, cea de-a $j$-a cifră de pe linia $i$ fiind $0$ dacă în ziua $i$ tipul $j$ de cafea nu este produs, sau fiind $1$ dacă în ziua $i$ tipul $j$ de cafea este produs.

# Date de ieșire
Pentru fiecare dintre cele $T$ instanțe se va afișa răspunsul, începând de la o linie noua, după cum urmează:

1. Dacă $P = 1$, atunci se va afișa pe o singură linie numărul maxim de pachete valide ce pot fi formate.
2. Dacă $P = 2$, atunci se va afișa pe o singură linie numărul de moduri de a împărți zilele în secvențe continue astfel încât să se formeze număr maxim de pachete. Răspunsul va fi afișat $\text{mod } 1\ 000\ 000\ 007$.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 2$
* $1 ≤ T ≤ 3$
* $1 ≤ N ≤ 200\ 000$
* $1 ≤ K ≤ 20$
* Se garantează că fiecare tip de cafea apare în cel puțin una dintre cele $N$ zile.

## Punctare
* Pentru 6 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 15$
* Pentru alte 6 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 100$
* Pentru alte 9 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 2\ 000$
* Pentru alte 10 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 200\ 000$
* Pentru alte 10 puncte: $P = 2, K = 1, N ≤ 200\ 000$
* Pentru alte 4 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 15$
* Pentru alte 4 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 20$
* Pentru alte 9 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 100$
* Pentru alte 8 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 700$
* Pentru alte 8 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 2\ 000$
* Pentru alte 8 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 10\ 000$
* Pentru alte 9 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 70\ 000$

    for i in range(N):

        if all(day == 1 for day in production[i]):
            count += 1
            for j in range(K):
                last_seen[j] = i
        else:
            for j in range(K):

        if all(day == 1 for day in production[i]):
            count += 1
            ways = (ways * prefix_counts[min_last_seen]) % MOD

                last_seen[j] = i
            prefix_counts = [1] * N
        else:
            for j in range(K):
                if production[i][j] == 1:
                    last_seen[j] = i
        if min(last_seen) > min_last_seen:
            count += 1
            ways = (ways * prefix_counts[min_last_seen]) % MOD
            prefix_counts = [1] * N
        prefix_counts[min(last_seen)] += 1
    return ways

def solve(P, instances):
    results = []
    for N, K, production in instances:
        if P == 1:
            results.append(max_packages(N, K, production))
        elif P == 2:
            results.append(ways_to_divide(N, K, production))
    return results

def main():
    P = int(input())
    T = int(input())

```

This solution reads a problem type `P` and a number of scenarios `T` from `stdin`. Then it reads each scenario, consisting of `N` and `K` followed by `N` days of production history. It solves each scenario depending on the problem type `P` and prints the results to `stdout`. The performance of this code should be sufficient as it uses linear scans of the production days, and keeps track of the information needed to calculate either the total number of packages or the number of ways to divide the days to achieve the maximum number of packages. 

The logic for ways_to_divide includes a prefix_counts array that keeps track of the number of ways to end a package through day `i`, given that the package could have started after the last day all types of coffee beans were seen. This count is reset whenever a new package can definitely be started because all types of coffee beans are seen on a particular day. The `ways` are then multiplied by the count at the position of the last day before the current minimum of `last_seen`, which represents the last day a new package could have started. This operation is performed modulo `MOD`.

The original solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of packages that can be formed. The logic was not accounting for the fact that a sequence must contain all types of coffee beans at least once. We need to keep track of the production and only count a new package when all types of beans have been found.

Here is a revised version of the solution that should correctly implement this logic for both parts of the challenge:

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

def max_packages(N, K, production):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the last seen day for each type of coffee
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    # Initialize variable to count the number of packages
    count = 0
    # Set of coffee types seen in the current sequence
    seen = set()
    
    # Iterate through each day
    for day, prod in enumerate(production):
        # Update the last seen day for each type of coffee produced that day
        for k in range(K):
            if prod[k]:
                seen.add(k)
                last_seen[k] = day
        # Check if we have seen all types of coffee in the current sequence
        if len(seen) == K:
            count += 1  # We can form a new package
            seen.clear()  # Reset for the next sequence

    return count

def ways_to_divide(N, K, production):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the last seen day for each type of coffee
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    # Initialize variable to count the number of packages and ways to divide
    count, ways = 0, 1
    # Set of coffee types seen in the current sequence
    seen = set()

    # Variables to track the start of a sequence
    last_start = 0
    sequence_starts = [0] * N
    
    # Iterate through each day
    for day, prod in enumerate(production):
        # Update the last seen day for each type of coffee produced that day
        for k in range(K):
            if prod[k]:
                seen.add(k)
                last_seen[k] = day
        # If all types of coffee have been seen, this can be a new package
        if len(seen) == K:
            count += 1  # Increment package count
            start_day = max(last_seen)  # Find the earliest day we can start the next sequence
            sequence_starts[start_day] += 1
            ways *= sequence_starts[last_start]  # Multiply the ways by the number of starts from the last start
            ways %= MOD  # Take modulo for the result
            last_start = start_day + 1  # Update the start of the next sequence
            seen.clear()  # Reset for the next sequence

    return ways

def solve(P, instances):
    results = []
    for N, K, production in instances:
        if P == 1:
            results.append(max_packages(N, K, production))
        elif P == 2:
            results.append(ways_to_divide(N, K, production))
    return results

def main():
    P = int(input().strip())
    T = int(input().strip())
    instances = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().strip().split())
        production = [list(map(int, input().strip())) for _ in range(N)]
        instances.append((N, K, production))
    results = solve(P, instances)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution should now correctly output the number of maximum packages and the number of ways to divide the days for forming the maximum number of packages. It uses a set to ensure each type of coffee is seen before incrementing the package count and also tracks the start points of sequences for the second part of the problem.

It appears my previous solution didn't correctly calculate the number of ways to divide the days into sequences of packages that contain all types of coffee. Let's review the logic and correct it.

For part 2 of the problem (P = 2), we need to count the combinations of consecutive days that include all coffee types. To do this, we keep track of the number of ways to start a new package after the last day all types of coffee have been produced at least once. We also need to handle the situation when all types of coffee are produced on the same day.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

def find_max_packages_and_ways(N, K, production):
    # The last_seen array stores the last day each type of coffee was produced.
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    # The package_starts array stores the number of ways a package could start after a given day.
    package_starts = [0] * N
    # The total number of packages we can form.
    max_packages = 0
    # The number of ways we can form the maximum number of packages.
    ways = 1

    # Initialize the package_starts of day 0 as 1 way.
    package_starts[0] = 1

    # Go through each day and update last_seen and package_starts accordingly.
    for day in range(N):
        # Update the last seen day for the types of coffee produced this day.
        for k in range(K):
            if production[day][k] == 1:
                last_seen[k] = day

        # Check if we have seen all types at least once.
        if min(last_seen) != -1:
            if all(production[day]):  # Special case: all coffee types are produced on the same day
                max_packages += 1
                ways = (ways * package_starts[min(last_seen)]) % MOD
                package_starts = [0] * N  # Reset package_starts
                package_starts[day + 1] = 1  # The next day can be the start of a new package
            else:
                # Update the max_packages if we can form a new package.
                if day > 0 and package_starts[day] == 0 and min(last_seen) < day:
                    max_packages += 1
                    ways = (ways * package_starts[min(last_seen)]) % MOD
                    package_starts = [0] * N  # Reset package_starts
                # Update the number of ways a package could start on this or the next day.
                package_starts[max(day, min(last_seen) + 1)] += 1

    return max_packages, ways

def solve(P, instances):
    results = []
    for N, K, production in instances:
        if P == 1:
            max_packages, _ = find_max_packages_and_ways(N, K, production)
            results.append(max_packages)
        elif P == 2:
            _, ways = find_max_packages_and_ways(N, K, production)
            results.append(ways)
    return results

def main():
    P = int(input().strip())
    T = int(input().strip())
    instances = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().strip().split())
        production = [list(map(int, input().strip())) for _ in range(N)]
        instances.append((N, K, production))
    results = solve(P, instances)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this revised solution, I have used a single function `find_max_packages_and_ways` to calculate both the maximum number of packages and the number of ways to divide the days. This is because the two calculations are interrelated. The function iterates through each day, updates the `last_seen` array, and then, if all types of coffee have been seen, it increments the `max_packages` and multiplies the `ways` by the number of package starts after the last minimum day seen.

The output should now match the expected output for the given input data.

The error occurred because the code attempted to assign a value to an index (`day + 1`) that is out of range for the `package_starts` list. This happens in the case where all coffee types are produced on the same day, which is the last day of the input range (day `N-1`). When `day` is `N-1` (the last possible index in `production`), `day + 1` will be `N`, which is outside the valid index range for `package_starts`.

To fix this issue, I will ensure that we do not access an out-of-bounds index in the `package_starts` list. Also, I will refactor the code to handle the calculation of ways correctly, including the special case where all coffee types are produced on the same day.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

def max_packages_and_ways(N, K, production):
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    max_packages = 0
    ways = 1
    current_ways = 1

    for i in range(N):
        current_min = min(last_seen)  # The earliest day since we've seen all coffee types
        all_coffee_types_seen = current_min != -1

        if all_coffee_types_seen:
            if i > current_min:  # We can form a new package
                max_packages += 1
                ways = (ways * current_ways) % MOD
                current_ways = 1  # Reset the number of ways for the new interval

        # Update the last seen day for each coffee type
        for k in range(K):
            if production[i][k] == 1:
                if last_seen[k] < current_min:  # We've started seeing a new coffee type since the last package
                    current_ways = 1
                last_seen[k] = i

        if not all_coffee_types_seen:
            current_ways += 1  # We can start a new package in different ways

    return max_packages, ways

def solve(P, instances):
    results = []
    for N, K, production in instances:
        max_packages, ways = max_packages_and_ways(N, K, production)
        if P == 1:
            results.append(max_packages)
        elif P == 2:
            results.append(ways)
    return results

def main():
    P = int(input().strip())
    T = int(input().strip())
    instances = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().strip().split())
        production = [list(map(int, input().strip())) for _ in range(N)]
        instances.append((N, K, production))
    results = solve(P, instances)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected solution should now correctly handle the out-of-bounds issue and calculate the maximum number of packages and the number of ways to divide the days correctly. The `current_ways` variable is used to keep track of new intervals where a package can start, and it's reset whenever a package can definitely be formed. This approach should handle all cases, including the last day and the case where all coffee types are produced on the same day.

The previous implementation seems to have a logic bug in the way it's tracking the ability to start a new package. To fix the logic, we need to rethink the approach to find the maximum number of packages (`P = 1`) and the number of ways to divide (`P = 2`).

The correct approach to finding the maximum number of packages should keep track of the last production day for each type of coffee. A new package can be formed only when every type of coffee has been produced since the last package was formed.

For the number of ways to divide (`P = 2`), we need to track the flexibility in choosing the start day for each new package. Once a day is encountered where all types of coffee have been produced since the last package was formed, then the sequence can end, and new sequences can start on any day where all types have been produced since the last sequence ended.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

def count_packages(N, K, production):
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    packages = 0
    for day in range(N):
        # Update last seen for each coffee type
        for coffee_type in range(K):
            if production[day][coffee_type]:
                last_seen[coffee_type] = day
        # If all coffee types are seen, we can form a package
        if all(day != -1 for day in last_seen) and min(last_seen) != packages:
            packages += 1
    return packages

def count_ways(N, K, production):
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    packages, ways, additional_ways = 0, 1, 1
    for day in range(N):
        # Update last seen for each coffee type
        for coffee_type in range(K):
            if production[day][coffee_type]:
                last_seen[coffee_type] = day
        # If all coffee types are seen
        if all(day != -1 for day in last_seen):
            min_last_seen = min(last_seen)
            # Check if we can form a new package
            if min_last_seen != packages:
                ways = (ways * additional_ways) % MOD
                additional_ways = 1
                packages = min_last_seen
            else:
                additional_ways += 1
    return ways

def main():

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        production = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]
        if P == 1:
            print(count_packages(N, K, production))
        elif P == 2:
            print(count_ways(N, K, production))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution separates the logic for counting the maximum number of packages and the number of ways to divide the days. The `count_packages` function counts the number of packages by tracking the last day each type of coffee was produced, while the `count_ways` function calculates the number of ways to divide the days by tracking the last day a package was formed and the flexibility of starting new sequences.

The error occurred because the `production` list is expected to be a list of lists with binary values, but the input reading logic is incorrectly splitting each line into separate digits. This causes an "index out of range" error when trying to access `production[day][coffee_type]`. To fix this, I need to correct the input reading logic to avoid splitting binary values into separate digits.

Here's the corrected version of the solution:

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

def count_packages(N, K, production):
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    packages = 0
    for day in range(N):
        # Update last seen for each coffee type
        for coffee_type in range(K):
            if production[day][coffee_type] == '1':
                last_seen[coffee_type] = day
        # If all coffee types are seen, we can form a package
        if all(day != -1 for day in last_seen) and min(last_seen) != packages:
            packages += 1
    return packages

def count_ways(N, K, production):
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    packages, ways, additional_ways = 0, 1, 1
    for day in range(N):
        # Update last seen for each coffee type
        for coffee_type in range(K):
            if production[day][coffee_type] == '1':
                last_seen[coffee_type] = day
        # If all coffee types are seen
        if all(day != -1 for day in last_seen):
            min_last_seen = min(last_seen)
            # Check if we can form a new package
            if min_last_seen != packages:
                ways = (ways * additional_ways) % MOD
                additional_ways = 1
                packages = min_last_seen
            else:
                additional_ways += 1
    return ways

def main():
    P = int(input().strip())
    T = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().strip().split())
        production = [input().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        if P == 1:
            print(count_packages(N, K, production))
        elif P == 2:
            print(count_ways(N, K, production))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code should now correctly read the input without splitting the binary values into separate digits and the `count_packages` and `count_ways` functions will work properly. Now each `production[day]` is a string of `K` binary characters, and we check for `'1'` to see if a coffee type is produced on that day.

It seems that the previous implementation still has a logical error. Let's revisit the logic for counting the maximum number of packages (`P = 1`).

For each day, we need to check if we can form a new package. We can form a package if every type of coffee has been produced at least once since the last time we formed a package. This check should be performed on each day, and we should form a package as soon as it becomes possible.

Here's a revised version of the solution that should correctly count the maximum number of packages and compute the number of ways to divide days:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 1_000_000_007

def count_packages(N, K, production):
    last_seen = [-1] * K  # Stores the last day each type of coffee was produced.
    start = 0  # The potential start day of the next package.
    packages = 0  # Counts the number of packages.

    for day in range(N):
        for coffee in range(K):
            # Update the last seen day for each type of coffee produced.
            if production[day][coffee] == '1':
                last_seen[coffee] = day
        # Check if all types of coffee have been produced since the start.
        if all(last_seen[coffee] >= start for coffee in range(K)):
            packages += 1
            start = day + 1  # Start the next package the day after.

    return packages

def count_ways(N, K, production):
    last_seen = [-1] * K
    start = 0
    packages = 0
    ways = 1
    # Stores the number of ways we can start a package from each day.
    possible_starts = defaultdict(int)
    possible_starts[0] = 1

    for day in range(N):
        for coffee in range(K):
            if production[day][coffee] == '1':
                last_seen[coffee] = day
        # If all coffee types have been produced, count ways to start packages.
        if all(last_seen[coffee] >= start for coffee in range(K)):
            packages += 1
            # The ways to start the next package is the sum of possible starts.
            ways = (ways * possible_starts[start]) % MOD
            start = day + 1
            possible_starts = defaultdict(int)  # Reset for the next package.
        possible_starts[start] += 1

    return ways

def main():
    P = int(input())
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        production = [input() for _ in range(N)]
        if P == 1:
            print(count_packages(N, K, production))
        elif P == 2:
            print(count_ways(N, K, production))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated code should now correctly handle the logic for both `P = 1` and `P = 2`. In `count_packages`, we form a new package as soon as it becomes possible, and in `count_ways`, for each day, we calculate the number of ways to start the next package based on the sum of possible starts from the day we formed the last package.
