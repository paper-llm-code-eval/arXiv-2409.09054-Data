Jean-Luc Picard, căpitanul navei spațiale Enterprise, a constatat că în vecinătatea navei sale au apărut $n$ nave borgiene. Distanțele dintre acestea și nava Enterprise sunt $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$. Navele borgiene nu se deplasează unele în raport cu altele și nici în raport cu nava Enterprise. Pozițiile în spațiu ale celor $n$ nave borgiene și poziția navei Enterprise sunt distincte două câte două (nu există două nave care să ocupe același punct în spațiul tridimensional).

La un moment dat, toate cele $n$ nave borgiene declanșează simultan atacul, lansând câte un proiectil în direcția navei Enterprise. Pereții navei Enterprise sunt rezistenți la asemenea atacuri, însă căpitanul decide să distrugă un număr maxim de proiectile cu ajutorul armei laser. Cele n proiectile se deplasează cu vitezele constante $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ exprimate în metri pe secundă. Căpitanul Jean-Luc Picard are la dispoziție o armă laser cu care poate distruge pe rând câte un proiectil. Arma poate fi orientată instantaneu spre oricare navă borgiană. Arma laser poate executa oricâte trageri începând cu momentul declanșării atacului, dar după fiecare tragere are nevoie de $t$ secunde pentru a se reîncărca cu energie. În acest interval de timp nu se poate efectua o altă tragere. Orientarea armei laser spre un anumit proiectil nu consumă timp. De asemenea, timpul scurs între momentul tragerii și distrugerea proiectilului vizat este zero. Căpitanul nu ratează ținta niciodată, iar proiectilele care reușesc să lovească nava Enterprise nu-l pot împiedica pe căpitanul Picard să continue să tragă asupra altor proiectile aflate în mișcare.

# Cerință

Să se găsească numărul maxim de proiectile care pot fi distruse cu arma laser.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `startrek.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $n$ și $t$, reprezentând numărul de nave borgiene, respectiv timpul de reîncărcare a armei laser cu energie. Pe linia a doua, sunt $n$ numere naturale $d_1 \ d_2 \ \dots \ d_n$ reprezentând distanțele la care se găsesc navele borgiene față de nava Enterprise. Pe linia a treia se găsesc $n$ numere naturale $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ reprezentând vitezele de deplasare ale celor $n$ proiectile.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `startrek.out` va conține un număr natural $p$, reprezentând numărul maxim de proiectile distruse.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 4 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$;
* $t \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Dacă momentul în care un proiectil ar trebui să lovească nava coincide cu momentul în care se trage cu arma laser asupra lui, se consideră că Enterprise distruge acel proiectil.
* Dacă viteza unui proiectil este $v$, atunci în timpul $t$, acesta străbate distanța $d = v \cdot t$

The issue with the previous code is that it doesn't prioritize projectiles correctly. It sorts the hit times in ascending order, which would normally work if all projectiles could be destroyed by the time they hit. However, given the recharge time `t`, Picard might miss the opportunity to destroy a projectile that arrives slightly later but has a significantly shorter hit time after the recharge period.

Therefore, we need to sort projectiles by the time after which they can be shot again, considering the recharge time. This means if two projectiles arrive at times `a` and `b` where `a < b`, but `a + t > b`, then projectile `b` should be prioritized because Picard can shoot it down sooner after the recharge time.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to read from startrek.in and write to startrek.out
def solve_startrek_problem():
    with open('startrek.in', 'r') as file:
        n, t = map(int, file.readline().split())
        distances = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        speeds = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Calculate the time it would take for each projectile to hit the Enterprise
    hit_times = [(distances[i] / speeds[i], i) for i in range(n)]

    # Sort hit times by the time at which Picard can shoot again after destroying them
    hit_times.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0] / speeds[x[1]], -speeds[x[1]]))

    destroyed = 0
    current_time = 0
    for hit_time, index in hit_times:
        # Check if Picard can destroy the projectile after the recharge time
        if hit_time >= current_time:
            destroyed += 1
            current_time = hit_time + t

    with open('startrek.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(destroyed))

# Call the function to solve the problem
solve_startrek_problem()
```

In this updated solution, we store both the hit time and the index of the projectile. We sort the projectiles first by the time they can be targeted again (`hit_time / speeds[index]`) and then by their speed in descending order (`-speeds[index]`) to prioritize faster projectiles if they can be targeted at the same time. This ensures Picard destroys the maximum number of projectiles possible considering the recharge time constraint.

The previous solution made an incorrect assumption in the sorting key by using `hit_time / speeds[index]`. The correct approach is to sort the projectiles based on the time they will hit the Enterprise, but we also need to consider the recharge time to determine when Picard can shoot again after destroying a projectile.

The correct algorithm should prioritize projectiles by their hit times, but after shooting one down, we must update the earliest time Picard can shoot again by adding the recharge time. Then, we iterate through the sorted list of hit times, and only consider projectiles that will hit after the current earliest time Picard can shoot again.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
def solve_startrek_problem():
    with open('startrek.in', 'r') as file:
        n, t = map(int, file.readline().split())
        distances = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        speeds = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Calculate the time it would take for each projectile to hit the Enterprise
    hit_times = [distances[i] / speeds[i] for i in range(n)]

    # Sort the hit times in ascending order
    sorted_hit_times = sorted(hit_times)

    destroyed = 0
    current_time = 0
    for hit_time in sorted_hit_times:
        # Picard can only shoot if the projectile will hit after or at the current time
        if hit_time >= current_time:
            destroyed += 1
            current_time = hit_time + t  # Update the earliest time Picard can shoot again

    with open('startrek.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(destroyed))

solve_startrek_problem()
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the maximum number of projectiles that can be destroyed given the recharge time. It ensures that Picard only shoots projectiles that can be hit considering the earliest next time he can shoot after accounting for the recharge time.

Upon re-evaluating the problem, it becomes clear that the critical aspect of the algorithm is to prioritize shooting down the projectiles based on the time they will take to reach the Enterprise after factoring in the recharge time of the laser. The solution must sort the projectiles not only by their hit times but also by their potential hit times after each recharge period.

The issue in the previous solutions is that they did not account for the fact that after destroying a projectile and waiting for the recharge time, it might be more optimal to shoot down a projectile that was initially further away but now is closer than others because of its speed.

To fix the problem, we need to calculate the potential hit times for all projectiles after each possible recharge period and then sort them based on these times. The correct approach is to simulate the process, considering the recharge time after shooting down each projectile and choosing the next projectile that can be shot down as soon as the laser is ready.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def solve_startrek_problem():
    with open('startrek.in', 'r') as file:
        n, t = map(int, file.readline().split())
        distances = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        speeds = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Pair each projectile with its arrival time to the Enterprise
    projectiles = sorted([(distances[i] / speeds[i], i) for i in range(n)])

    destroyed = 0
    current_time = 0
    while projectiles:
        # Find the next projectile that can be destroyed
        for i, (arrival_time, idx) in enumerate(projectiles):
            if arrival_time >= current_time:
                destroyed += 1
                current_time = arrival_time + t
                projectiles.pop(i)
                break
        else:
            # If no projectile can be shot down, we are done
            break

    with open('startrek.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(destroyed))

solve_startrek_problem()
```

This solution follows these steps:

1. Read input data and pair each projectile with its arrival time.
2. Sort projectiles by arrival time.
3. Initialize the counter for destroyed projectiles and the current time.
4. Iteratively find the next projectile that can be shot down after considering the recharge time.
5. Remove the destroyed projectile from the list and update the current time.
6. Repeat the process until no more projectiles can be destroyed.
7. Write the total count of destroyed projectiles to the output file.

The issue with the previous solutions is that they don't account for the fact that after shooting down one projectile and waiting for the recharge time, the next projectile to shoot may not be the one with the next smallest hit time. It's possible that a projectile with a larger initial hit time could be a better target after factoring in the laser's recharge time.

To correct this, we need to adjust our approach. Once a projectile is shot down, we must review the list of remaining projectiles to find the next one that can be destroyed given the current time (after the recharge period). This requires re-evaluating the list of projectiles after each shot to account for the passage of time during the laser's recharge.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def solve_startrek_problem():
    with open('startrek.in', 'r') as file:
        n, t = map(int, file.readline().split())
        distances = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        speeds = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Calculate the arrival time for each projectile to Enterprise
    arrival_times = [distances[i] / speeds[i] for i in range(n)]

    # Sort the projectiles by their arrival time
    projectiles = sorted((time, idx) for idx, time in enumerate(arrival_times))

    destroyed = 0
    current_time = 0
    # Loop until there are no projectiles left to consider
    while projectiles:
        # Find the projectile that can be destroyed next
        for i, (time, _) in enumerate(projectiles):
            if time >= current_time:
                destroyed += 1
                current_time = time + t
                projectiles.pop(i)
                break
        else:
            # No more projectiles can be destroyed
            break

    with open('startrek.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(destroyed))

solve_startrek_problem()
```

In this solution, we:

1. Read the input data and calculate the arrival times for each projectile.
2. Sort the projectiles by their calculated arrival times.
3. Loop through the sorted list of projectiles, and for each one:
   - If its arrival time is greater than or equal to the current time, destroy the projectile, increment the counter, update the current time by adding the recharge time, and remove the projectile from the list.
4. Break the loop if no more projectiles can be destroyed (i.e., all remaining projectiles would arrive before the laser can be used again).
5. Write the total number of destroyed projectiles to the output file.

This solution should now give the correct output for the test case provided. The projectiles are re-evaluated after each shot to ensure the next target is the one that can be shot down soonest, taking the recharge time into account.

Upon further analysis, it appears that the provided algorithm has a fundamental flaw in the way it iterates and pops elements from the list of projectiles. Since the list of projectiles is being modified while being iterated over, this can lead to skipping some projectiles unintentionally, which can cause incorrect results.

A better approach is to iterate over a list of indices representing the projectiles and mark the projectiles as destroyed without modifying the list during iteration. After each projectile is destroyed, we should re-evaluate the next projectile that can be shot down, considering the laser's recharge time.

Let's fix the solution with a more appropriate algorithm:

```python
def solve_startrek_problem():
    with open('startrek.in', 'r') as file:
        n, t = map(int, file.readline().split())
        distances = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        speeds = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Calculate the time it would take for each projectile to reach the Enterprise
    hit_times = [distances[i] / speeds[i] for i in range(n)]

    # Create a list of projectiles represented by their hit times and indices
    projectiles = sorted([(hit_times[i], i) for i in range(n)])

    destroyed = 0
    current_time = 0
    # Keep track of projectiles that have been destroyed
    destroyed_indices = set()

    # Continue until we've gone through all projectiles
    while len(destroyed_indices) < n:
        # Find the next projectile that can be destroyed
        for hit_time, index in projectiles:
            if index not in destroyed_indices and hit_time >= current_time:
                destroyed += 1
                destroyed_indices.add(index)
                current_time = hit_time + t
                break
        else:
            # No projectile can be shot down at this time
            break

    with open('startrek.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(destroyed))

solve_startrek_problem()
```

In this corrected solution, we:

1. Read the input data and calculate the hit times for each projectile.
2. Sort the projectiles by their hit times.
3. Use a set to keep track of destroyed projectile indices.
4. Loop through the sorted projectiles, and for each one that has not been destroyed and can be hit given the current time, increment the destroyed counter, add its index to the destroyed set, and update the current time by adding the recharge time.
5. Write the total number of destroyed projectiles to the output file.

This solution should now correctly calculate and output the maximum number of projectiles that can be destroyed considering the recharge time of the laser.

The issue lies in my approach of trying to sort the projectiles first and then iterate through them to find which ones can be destroyed. Instead, I should calculate the time it takes for each projectile to hit Enterprise, determine how long it will take for the projectile to hit after considering the recharge time, and find the optimal order in which Captain Picard can destroy the projectiles. The sorting should actually be done based on how soon the projectiles can be destroyed after the recharge time, rather than by their initial arrival times alone.

Let's implement the correct solution using a priority queue (heapq in Python) that will allow us to always take the next destroyable projectile in the correct order, taking into account the recharge time:

```python
import heapq

def solve_startrek_problem():
    with open('startrek.in', 'r') as file:
        n, t = map(int, file.readline().split())
        distances = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        speeds = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    # Calculate the time it takes for each projectile to hit the Enterprise
    projectiles = [(distances[i] / speeds[i], i) for i in range(n)]

    # Initialize a heap with the hit times
    heapq.heapify(projectiles)

    destroyed = 0
    current_time = 0
    # Process projectiles in the order they can be destroyed
    while projectiles:
        hit_time, index = heapq.heappop(projectiles)
        # Update the current time with the recharge time and add back to the heap if needed
        if hit_time >= current_time:
            destroyed += 1
            current_time = hit_time + t
        else:
            # Calculate the next possible time the projectile could be destroyed
            next_destroy_time = current_time + ((current_time - hit_time - 1) // t + 1) * t
            heapq.heappush(projectiles, (next_destroy_time / speeds[index], index))

    with open('startrek.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(destroyed))

solve_startrek_problem()
```

In this approach, we use a heap to keep track of the projectiles. For each projectile, we calculate its hit time and add it to the heap. We then pop projectiles from the heap and check if they can be destroyed given the current time and the recharge time. If a projectile can be destroyed, we increment the counter and update the current time by adding the recharge time. If it can't be destroyed, we calculate the next time it could potentially be destroyed after the current time and recharge times have passed, then push it back to the heap with the new destroy time.

This solution ensures that we are always considering the right projectile to destroy next after each recharge period and should give us the correct output for the test case provided.
