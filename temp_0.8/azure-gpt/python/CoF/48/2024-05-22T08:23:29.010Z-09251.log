În Roma antică există $n$ aşezări senatoriale distincte, câte una pentru fiecare dintre cei $n$ senatori ai Republicii. Aşezările senatoriale sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, între oricare două aşezări existând legături directe sau indirecte. O legătură este directă dacă ea nu mai trece prin alte aşezări senatoriale intermediare. Edilii au pavat unele dintre legăturile directe dintre două aşezări (numind o astfel de legătură pavată ”stradă“), astfel încât între oricare două aşezări senatoriale să existe o singură succesiune de străzi prin care se poate ajunge de la o aşezare senatorială la cealaltă.

Toţi senatorii trebuie să participe la şedinţele Senatului. In acest scop, ei se deplasează cu lectica. Orice senator care se deplasează pe o stradă plăteşte $1$ ban pentru că a fost transportat cu lectica pe acea stradă.

La alegerea sa ca prim consul, Cezar a promis că va dota Roma cu o lectică gratuită care să circule pe un număr de $k$ străzi ale Romei astfel încât orice senator care va circula pe străzile respective, să poată folosi lectica gratuită fără a plăti. Străzile pe care se deplasează lectica gratuită trebuie să fie legate între ele (zborul, metroul sau teleportarea nefiind posibile la acea vreme). 

În plus, Cezar a promis să stabilească sediul sălii de şedinţe a Senatului într-una dintre aşezările senatoriale aflate pe traseul lecticii gratuite. Problema este de a alege cele $k$ străzi şi amplasarea sediului sălii de şedinţe a Senatului astfel încât, prin folosirea transportului gratuit, senatorii, în drumul lor spre sala de şedinţe, să facă economii cât mai însemnate. În calculul costului total de transport, pentru toţi senatorii, Cezar a considerat că fiecare senator va călători exact o dată de la aşezarea sa până la sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care determină costul minim care se poate obţine prin alegerea adecvată a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului de amplasare a sălii de şedinţă a Senatului.

# Date de intrare 
Fişierul `cezar.in` conţine
- pe prima linie două valori $n\ k$ separate printr-un saţiu reprezentând numărul total de senatori şi numărul de strazi pe care circulă lectica gratuită
- pe următorele $n-1$ linii se află câte două valori $i\ j$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numerele de ordine a două aşezări senatoriale între care există stradă.

# Date de ieşire
Pe prima linie a fişierului `cezar.out` se va scrie costul total minim al transportării tuturor senatorilor pentru o alegere optimă a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului unde va fi amplasată sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Restricţii
* $1 < n ≤ 10\ 000, 0 < k < n$
* $1 ≤ i, j ≤ n , i ≠ j$
* Oricare două perechi de valori de pe liniile $2, 3, ..., n$ din fişierul de intrare reprezintă două străzi distincte.
* Perechile din fişierul de intrare sunt date astfel încât respectă condiţiile din problemă.
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $n ≤ 30$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $30 < n ≤ 1\ 000$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read from the input file
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile]

# Create adjacency list for the graph
adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for u, v in edges:
    adj[u].append(v)
    adj[v].append(u)

# Depth-First Search to compute subtree size and max depth
def dfs(node, parent):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    max_depths[node] = 0
    for neighbor in adj[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            dfs(neighbor, node)
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[neighbor]
            max_depths[node] = max(max_depths[node], max_depths[neighbor] + 1)

# Function to find centroid of a tree
def find_centroid(node, parent, tree_size):
    for neighbor in adj[node]:
        if neighbor != parent and subtree_sizes[neighbor] > tree_size // 2:
            return find_centroid(neighbor, node, tree_size)
    return node

# Initialize global variables
subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
max_depths = [0] * (n + 1)

# Start DFS from node 1 assuming node 1 is always part of the tree
dfs(1, -1)

# Find centroid of the tree
centroid = find_centroid(1, -1, subtree_sizes[1])

# Running DFS again from centroid to get max depths
dfs(centroid, -1)

# Sort the depths in descending order and pick top k depths
sorted_max_depths = sorted(max_depths, reverse=True)
cost = sum(sorted_max_depths[k:])

# Write to the output file
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(cost))
```

This solution first constructs the graph by reading from the input file and creates an adjacency list representation. It then performs Depth-First Search (DFS) to calculate subtree sizes and max depths from every node. To minimize the overall cost, we find the centroid of the tree which minimizes the maximum distance from the centroid to any other point in the tree. We then run DFS again from the centroid to find the depths of each node in the tree, sort these depths, and calculate the cost by excluding the largest k depths (since these would be covered by the free lectica). The result is written to the output file.

I apologize for the earlier confusion. After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, I realize that my initial approach did not correctly account for the cost savings from the k free streets. The sort and pick approach used in the initial solution was based on the maximum depths from the centroid, which is not the correct way to calculate the cost savings.

To fix this, we need to find the k most costly paths from the centroid to the leaf nodes, as these are the paths where we want to offer free transportation. This will yield the highest cost saving. We can achieve this by calculating the total cost of all paths first and then subtracting the cost of the k most costly paths that will be made free.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct approach:

```python
# Function to calculate total cost and store individual path costs in a list
def dfs_cost(node, parent, depth):
    global total_cost, path_costs
    total_cost += depth
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs_cost(child, node, depth + 1)
    # If it's a leaf node, add the path cost to the list
    if len(adj[node]) == 1 and node != centroid:
        path_costs.append(depth)

# Read from the input file
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in infile.readlines()]

# Create adjacency list for the graph
adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for u, v in edges:
    adj[u].append(v)
    adj[v].append(u)

# Depth-First Search to compute subtree size and max depth
def dfs(node, parent):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    for neighbor in adj[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            dfs(neighbor, node)
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[neighbor]

# Function to find centroid of a tree
def find_centroid(node, parent, tree_size):
    for neighbor in adj[node]:
        if neighbor != parent and subtree_sizes[neighbor] > tree_size // 2:
            return find_centroid(neighbor, node, tree_size)
    return node

# Initialize global variables
subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
total_cost = 0
path_costs = []

# Run DFS from the first node to compute subtree sizes
dfs(1, -1)

# Find centroid of the tree
centroid = find_centroid(1, -1, subtree_sizes[1])

# Run DFS from the centroid to calculate total cost and path costs
dfs_cost(centroid, -1, 0)

# Sort the path costs in descending order and subtract the cost of k most costly paths
path_costs.sort(reverse=True)
cost = total_cost - sum(path_costs[:k])

# Write to the output file
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(cost))
```

In this corrected solution, `dfs_cost` calculates the total cost to travel all paths and stores the cost of each path from the centroid to leaf nodes in the `path_costs` list. After sorting this list in descending order, we subtract the cost of the `k` most costly paths to determine the cost savings from the free transportation. The result is then written to the output file.

The program result does not match the expected result due to a logical error in the way the savings are computed. Instead of subtracting the cost of the `k` most costly paths, we need to find a subtree that includes `k` edges (or `k + 1` nodes) where the cost-saving is maximized.

For this, we should calculate the savings for each node by considering the cost if that node were to be the meeting point. We will simulate the process of making `k` streets free by taking the subtree rooted at that node with `k + 1` deepest nodes. The savings are then the sum of distances from each node to the meeting point, minus the distances within the free streets.

This problem requires understanding of tree data structures and depth-first search (DFS) for calculating the depth of each node and the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node.

Here is a reimplementation with the correct logic:

```python
def dfs1(node, parent):
    global children_count
    children_count[node] = 1  # Count the node itself
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            depth[child] = depth[node] + 1
            dfs1(child, node)
            children_count[node] += children_count[child]

def dfs2(node, parent, total_nodes):
    # Finding the node that divides the tree into the most balanced parts
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent and children_count[child] > total_nodes // 2:
            return dfs2(child, node, total_nodes)
    return node

# Read from the input file
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    adj = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for line in infile:
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)

# Initialize variables
children_count = [0] * (n + 1)
depth = [0] * (n + 1)

# Running DFS to find depth and children count of each node
dfs1(1, -1)

# Calculate total distance cost
total_cost = sum(depth)

# Find the centroid of the tree
centroid = dfs2(1, -1, n)

# Reset depth and children count for centroid tree
depth = [0] * (n + 1)
children_count = [0] * (n + 1)

# Running DFS again to find depth and children count from centroid
dfs1(centroid, -1)

# Sort nodes by depth, descending, keeping only the k + 1 deepest
nodes_by_depth = sorted(range(1, n + 1), key=lambda x: depth[x], reverse=True)
deepest_nodes = nodes_by_depth[:k + 1]

# Calculate the savings
savings = sum(depth[node] for node in deepest_nodes)

# Calculate the minimal cost
minimal_cost = total_cost - savings

# Write to the output file
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(minimal_cost))
```

In this solution, we perform the following steps:
1. We read the input and construct the adjacency list `adj` to represent the graph.
2. We run `dfs1` to compute the depth of each node and the number of children for each node (subtree size).
3. We use `dfs2` to find the centroid of the tree.
4. We reset the depths and run `dfs1` again from the centroid to get the correct depths for calculating the savings.
5. We sort nodes by depth, keeping the `k+1` deepest nodes.
6. We calculate the savings by considering the depth of these nodes from the centroid.
7. We subtract the savings from the total cost to find the minimal cost and write it to the output file.

To solve this problem, we need to use a tree dynamic programming approach. First, we'll calculate the distance of each node to all other nodes by performing a DFS. Then, we will calculate the total sum of distances as if there were no free streets. After that, we will identify the subtree with exactly `k + 1` nodes (as free streets connect `k + 1` nodes) that, if made free, would save the most in terms of the sum of distances.

Let's correct the solution by implementing this approach:

```python
def dfs(node, parent, depth):
    distances[node] = depth
    total = 1  # Count the current node
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            child_total = dfs(child, node, depth + 1)
            children[node].append(child_total)
            total += child_total
    return total

def find_savings(node, parent, remaining_k):
    saving = distances[node]  # The cost saving if this node is on a free street
    # Sort children by the savings they provide if they are the root of the free subtree
    children[node].sort(key=lambda x: -savings[x])
    for child_total in children[node]:
        if remaining_k > 0:
            # Use the child's subtree for savings if we still have free streets left
            child_saving = savings[child_total]
            saving += child_saving
            remaining_k -= child_total
        else:
            break
    return saving

# Read input from file
with open("cezar.in") as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    children = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = map(int, f.readline().split())
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)

# Initialize variables
distances = [0] * (n + 1)
savings = [0] * (n + 1)

# Run DFS from node 1 (arbitrarily chosen as root)
dfs(1, -1, 0)

# Calculate the total sum of distances (cost without any free streets)
total_sum = sum(distances)

# Calculate the savings for each node's subtree
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    savings[node] = find_savings(node, -1, k + 1)

# The result is the total sum minus the maximum saving
result = total_sum - max(savings)

# Write the result to the output file
with open("cezar.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(result))
```

This code calculates the total distance sum first. Then it calculates the savings for each node's subtree with `k + 1` nodes. The final result is the total sum of distances minus the maximum saving that can be achieved by selecting a particular subtree to make its streets free. This result is written to the output file.

Given the recurring issue with the expected vs. actual output, it suggests there is a fundamental problem with the approach I took in the previous attempts. To achieve the expected result, we need to consider the following:

1. The graph is a tree, so there is a unique path between any two nodes.
2. We need to select `k` edges (or `k + 1` nodes) to offer free transportation that would result in the largest savings.
3. The cost is calculated as the sum of the distances all senators would travel if there were no free streets, minus the sum of the distances on the selected free streets.

Let's try a new approach:

1. Perform a DFS from an arbitrary node to determine the tree's diameter by finding the furthest node (let's call it `A`).
2. Perform a DFS from `A` to find the actual furthest node from `A` (let's call it `B`), which will give us the tree's diameter path.
3. The diameter's path contains the most significant number of nodes that can be reached; thus, offering free transportation on this path yields the highest savings.
4. We pick the middle `k + 1` nodes/edges from this path for free transportation.
5. Calculate the total distance savings by making transportation free on these edges.

Here is the reimplementation:

```python
def dfs(node, parent, acc_dist, furthest):
    acc_dist[node] = acc_dist[parent] + 1
    if acc_dist[node] > acc_dist[furthest]:
        furthest = node
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            furthest = dfs(child, node, acc_dist, furthest)
    return furthest

# Read the input
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for line in file:
        u, v = map(int, line.split())
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

# Step 1: Find one endpoint of the diameter
furthest_from_root = dfs(1, 0, [0] * (n + 1), 1)

# Step 2: Find the actual diameter
diameter_end = dfs(furthest_from_root, 0, [0] * (n + 1), furthest_from_root)

# Backtrack to find the diameter path
diameter_path = [diameter_end]
while diameter_path[-1] != furthest_from_root:
    for parent in adj[diameter_path[-1]]:
        if acc_dist[parent] == acc_dist[diameter_path[-1]] - 1:
            diameter_path.append(parent)
            break

# Step 3: Calculate savings by picking the middle k edges of the diameter
diameter_path.reverse()
middle = len(diameter_path) // 2
start = max(middle - k // 2, 0)
end = min(start + k, len(diameter_path) - 1)
savings = sum(acc_dist[node] for node in diameter_path[start:end + 1]) - acc_dist[diameter_path[start]]

# Step 4: Calculate the total cost and subtract the savings
total_cost = sum(acc_dist) - savings

# Write the output
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_cost))
```

In this solution, we are using `acc_dist` as an array that accumulates distances to each node from the starting point in the DFS. The furthest node from the arbitrary root is found, which is one endpoint of the diameter (`furthest_from_root`). Then, we find the other endpoint of the diameter (`diameter_end`). We backtrack from `diameter_end` to `furthest_from_root` to reconstruct the diameter path. We pick the `k` edges (or `k + 1` nodes) in the middle of this path to offer free rides and calculate the savings by making transportation free on these edges. The total cost is then the sum of distances all senators would travel minus these savings. This cost is what we output.

The exit code 1 and the accompanying traceback indicate that there is a `NameError` in the code because the variable `acc_dist` is not defined in the scope where it's being used. The variable `acc_dist` should be declared outside of the `dfs` function to maintain its scope throughout the program.

Let's fix the code by ensuring that `acc_dist` is defined globally and used correctly within the program. We will also ensure that the calculation of total cost and savings is accurate:

```python
def dfs(node, parent, acc_dist):
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            acc_dist[child] = acc_dist[node] + 1
            dfs(child, node, acc_dist)

# Read the input
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for line in file:
        u, v = map(int, line.split())
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

# Find the furthest node from an arbitrary starting point (node 1)
acc_dist = [0] * (n + 1)
dfs(1, 0, acc_dist)
furthest_node = acc_dist.index(max(acc_dist))

# Find the furthest node from the furthest_node to determine the diameter path
acc_dist = [0] * (n + 1)
dfs(furthest_node, 0, acc_dist)
furthest_from_furthest = acc_dist.index(max(acc_dist))

# Reconstruct the diameter path
diameter_path = []
node = furthest_from_furthest
while node != furthest_node:
    diameter_path.append(node)
    for parent in adj[node]:
        if acc_dist[parent] == acc_dist[node] - 1:
            node = parent
            break
diameter_path.append(furthest_node)

# Calculate initial cost (no free streets)
total_cost = sum(acc_dist)

# Find the savings if k streets are made free along the diameter's path
diameter_path.reverse()
savings = sum(acc_dist[node] for node in diameter_path[:k + 1])
free_streets_cost = (k + 1) if k < len(diameter_path) else len(diameter_path)

# Calculate final cost
final_cost = total_cost - savings + free_streets_cost

# Write the output
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(final_cost))
```

In this fixed code, we first find the furthest node from node 1 to get one end of the diameter. Then, we find the furthest node from this furthest node to get the other end of the diameter. We reconstruct the diameter path by backtracking from one end to the other. We calculate the initial total cost without free streets using the sum of all distances. The savings are calculated from the `k + 1` deepest nodes on the diameter's path. Finally, we calculate the final cost by subtracting the savings from the total cost and correcting for the cost of free streets. We write the final cost to the output file.

The previous solution attempts to find the diameter and then pick the middle `k+1` nodes to maximize savings. However, this is not the correct approach, as it does not necessarily lead to the optimal savings. The optimal `k` edges do not have to be in the middle of the diameter; they could be anywhere in the tree. The approach should instead focus on the breadth of the tree where it is widest, not necessarily the longest path from end to end.

To find the optimal `k` edges, we can consider using a different approach:

1. Run a DFS traversal to calculate the number of nodes in each subtree and the total distance cost for transportation.
2. Identify the `k+1` nodes that, when connected by `k` edges and having free transportation, would save the most cost.
3. The optimal nodes to connect are those that have the maximum number of nodes in their subtree with a depth up to `k`, as they would result in the most savings.

Let's implement a solution with the correct logic:

```python
def dfs(node, parent):
    count = 1  # Each node has at least itself in its subtree
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            child_count = dfs(child, node)
            count += child_count
            # Add the cost for this subtree, which is the count of nodes in the subtree
            subtree_costs.append((child_count, depth[node] + 1))
    return count

# Read the input
with open("cezar.in", "r") as f_input:
    n, k = map(int, f_input.readline().strip().split())
    adj = {i: [] for i in range(1, n+1)}
    for line in f_input:
        u, v = map(int, line.strip().split())
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

subtree_costs = []  # Will hold pairs of (number of nodes in subtree, depth of subtree root)
depth = [0] * (n+1)  # Depth of each node initialized to 0

# Run dfs from the root of the tree (arbitrary node 1)
dfs(1, -1)

# Sort the subtree costs based on the number of nodes in descending order
subtree_costs.sort(reverse=True)

# Choose the top k subtrees to minimize the cost
chosen_subtrees = subtree_costs[:k]

# The total cost savings is the sum of the costs of chosen subtrees
# minus the cost of traveling the edge to reach the subtree root
savings = sum(nodes * depth for nodes, depth in chosen_subtrees)

# Total initial cost is the sum of each senator traveling to the root node 1
total_cost = sum(depth)

# Calculate the final cost after applying the savings of free transportation on k edges
final_cost = total_cost - savings

# Write the output
with open("cezar.out", "w") as f_output:
    f_output.write(str(final_cost))
```

In this solution, `dfs` computes subtree sizes and records the cost of each subtree, which is the product of the number of nodes in the subtree and the depth of the subtree root. After sorting these costs, we select the top `k` subtrees that give us the most savings. The final cost is the total initial cost minus the savings from the free transportation on the `k` chosen edges. This result is written to the output file.
