În Roma antică există $n$ aşezări senatoriale distincte, câte una pentru fiecare dintre cei $n$ senatori ai Republicii. Aşezările senatoriale sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, între oricare două aşezări existând legături directe sau indirecte. O legătură este directă dacă ea nu mai trece prin alte aşezări senatoriale intermediare. Edilii au pavat unele dintre legăturile directe dintre două aşezări (numind o astfel de legătură pavată ”stradă“), astfel încât între oricare două aşezări senatoriale să existe o singură succesiune de străzi prin care se poate ajunge de la o aşezare senatorială la cealaltă.

Toţi senatorii trebuie să participe la şedinţele Senatului. In acest scop, ei se deplasează cu lectica. Orice senator care se deplasează pe o stradă plăteşte $1$ ban pentru că a fost transportat cu lectica pe acea stradă.

La alegerea sa ca prim consul, Cezar a promis că va dota Roma cu o lectică gratuită care să circule pe un număr de $k$ străzi ale Romei astfel încât orice senator care va circula pe străzile respective, să poată folosi lectica gratuită fără a plăti. Străzile pe care se deplasează lectica gratuită trebuie să fie legate între ele (zborul, metroul sau teleportarea nefiind posibile la acea vreme). 

În plus, Cezar a promis să stabilească sediul sălii de şedinţe a Senatului într-una dintre aşezările senatoriale aflate pe traseul lecticii gratuite. Problema este de a alege cele $k$ străzi şi amplasarea sediului sălii de şedinţe a Senatului astfel încât, prin folosirea transportului gratuit, senatorii, în drumul lor spre sala de şedinţe, să facă economii cât mai însemnate. În calculul costului total de transport, pentru toţi senatorii, Cezar a considerat că fiecare senator va călători exact o dată de la aşezarea sa până la sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care determină costul minim care se poate obţine prin alegerea adecvată a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului de amplasare a sălii de şedinţă a Senatului.

# Date de intrare 
Fişierul `cezar.in` conţine
- pe prima linie două valori $n\ k$ separate printr-un saţiu reprezentând numărul total de senatori şi numărul de strazi pe care circulă lectica gratuită
- pe următorele $n-1$ linii se află câte două valori $i\ j$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numerele de ordine a două aşezări senatoriale între care există stradă.

# Date de ieşire
Pe prima linie a fişierului `cezar.out` se va scrie costul total minim al transportării tuturor senatorilor pentru o alegere optimă a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului unde va fi amplasată sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Restricţii
* $1 < n ≤ 10\ 000, 0 < k < n$
* $1 ≤ i, j ≤ n , i ≠ j$
* Oricare două perechi de valori de pe liniile $2, 3, ..., n$ din fişierul de intrare reprezintă două străzi distincte.
* Perechile din fişierul de intrare sunt date astfel încât respectă condiţiile din problemă.
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $n ≤ 30$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $30 < n ≤ 1\ 000$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $1\ 000 < n ≤ 3\ 000$
* Pentru $10\%$ din teste $3\ 000 < n ≤ 5\ 000$  
* Pentru $10\%$ din teste $5\ 000 < n ≤ 10\ 000$.

This Python script reads from `cezar.in`, calculates the minimum total cost, and writes the result to `cezar.out`. It uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to compute the subtree sizes and the total costs from the root to all its descendants. It then finds the best node to place the senate by minimizing the cost and adjusting for the free streets `k`.

Upon reviewing the initial solution and its output, it seems there might be an issue with the logic that calculates the final cost, notably the part where we adjust for the free streets `k`. We should not directly subtract `k` from the total cost, as the actual savings depend on where the free streets are placed.

The free streets should be placed in such a way that they cover the most traveled paths to the senate. Since we're working with a tree, the optimal placement for the free streets would be starting from the best node (the senate location) along the path that covers the most senators, which is the path towards the center of the tree. We have to adjust our algorithm to properly account for the placement of the free streets.

I will now modify the algorithm to correctly determine the cost savings from the free streets. The `find_best_node` function should keep track of the path in the tree where the free streets would lead to the greatest cost reduction.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Function to build up the tree graph from the given edges
def build_tree(edges, n):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for i, j in edges:
        tree[i].append(j)
        tree[j].append(i)
    return tree

# Function to calculate the subtree sizes and total costs from node to all its descendants
def dfs(tree, node, parent, subtree_sizes, total_costs):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            total_costs[node] += dfs(tree, child, node, subtree_sizes, total_costs)
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
    total_costs[node] += subtree_sizes[node] - 1
    return total_costs[node]

# Function to find the best node for the senate and minimize the cost
def find_best_node(tree, node, parent, n, k, subtree_sizes, total_costs, best_cost, paths):
    # Update the best cost and node if this node yields a better cost
    cur_cost = total_costs[1] - (subtree_sizes[node] if parent != 0 else 0)
    if cur_cost < best_cost[0]:
        best_cost[0] = cur_cost
        best_cost[1] = node

    # Traverse the tree to find the best node
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            total_costs[child] = total_costs[node] - 2 * subtree_sizes[child] + n
            paths[child] = paths[node] + [child]  # Add the current child to the path
            find_best_node(tree, child, node, n, k, subtree_sizes, total_costs, best_cost, paths)

# Read input from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Process the edges and build the tree
tree = build_tree(edges, n)

subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
total_costs = [0] * (n + 1)
paths = {1: [1]}  # Dictionary to store paths from node 1 to all other nodes

# Calculate subtree sizes and total costs for transportation
dfs(tree, 1, 0, subtree_sizes, total_costs)

best_cost = [float('inf'), 0]  # Initialize best cost to infinity and best node to 0

# Find the best node for the senate
find_best_node(tree, 1, 0, n, k, subtree_sizes, total_costs, best_cost, paths)

# Find the path from the root to the best node
best_path = paths[best_cost[1]]

# Calculate the final cost considering the free streets
# We should give priority to the edges on the path to the best node
free_streets = min(k, len(best_path) - 1)  # Free streets cannot exceed the path length
final_cost = total_costs[1] - 2 * free_streets

# Write the output to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(final_cost) + '\n')
```

In this revised solution, I've made the following changes:
- Track the paths from the root node to every other node during the DFS traversal.
- Use the paths information to determine the best path to place free streets when finding the best node for the senate.
- Adjust the final cost calculation by considering the actual savings from placing free streets on the most traveled path, i.e., the path to the node where the senate is located. The savings are `2 * free_streets`, as each free street is traveled twice—once by the senators from that subtree and once by senators from the other side of the node.

This solution should now provide the correct total minimum cost and match the expected result.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates a logical error in the placement of the free streets and subsequent cost calculation. The intended optimization of placing free streets along the most traveled path may not have been correctly implemented.

The calculation of the final cost should account for the savings achieved by making 'k' streets free in the sub-tree with the most traffic towards the senate node. The savings are not necessarily '2 * k' because the senators pay for each street they travel through; thus, we should subtract 'k' from the total cost rather than '2 * k'.

Additionally, when choosing the best node for the senate, we need to identify the node that would minimize the cost after making 'k' streets free. This process involves not only finding the node with the minimum cost but also ensuring the path to it can accommodate 'k' free streets.

Let's reimplement the solution with a corrected approach for calculating the total cost savings and selecting the best senate node.

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def build_tree(edges):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        tree[a].append(b)
        tree[b].append(a)
    return tree

def bfs_to_find_depths(tree, root, n):
    depths = [0] * (n + 1)
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    queue = deque([root])
    visited[root] = True
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for child in tree[node]:
            if not visited[child]:
                visited[child] = True
                depths[child] = depths[node] + 1
                queue.append(child)
    return depths

def calculate_savings(tree, depths, n, k):
    # Count the number of senators at each depth level
    depth_count = defaultdict(int)
    for depth in depths[1:]:
        depth_count[depth] += 1

    # Find the deepest level we can afford to make free with k streets
    sorted_depths = sorted(depth_count.items(), key=lambda x: -x[0])
    savings = 0
    streets_left = k
    for depth, count in sorted_depths:
        if streets_left > 0:
            free_streets = min(streets_left, count)
            savings += free_streets * depth
            streets_left -= free_streets
        else:
            break

    return savings

# Read input from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Build the tree representation from edges
tree = build_tree(edges)

# Find the depths of each node using BFS
depths = bfs_to_find_depths(tree, 1, n)

# Calculate the savings by making k streets free
savings = calculate_savings(tree, depths, n, k)

# The total cost without any free streets is the sum of depths (since each senator pays 1 ban per street)
total_cost = sum(depths)

# The final cost is the total cost minus the savings from free streets
final_cost = total_cost - savings

# Write the output to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(final_cost) + '\n')
```

In this revised solution:
- We use BFS to find the depths of all nodes from the root as a proxy to calculate the distance traveled by senators.
- We build a dictionary to count the number of senators at each depth level.
- We sort the depths and calculate savings by making the deepest k streets free.
- The final cost is the total cost minus these savings.

This should now provide the correct total minimum cost and match the expected result.

The previous solutions did not produce the correct result. The reason for this discrepancy is that the algorithms did not correctly identify the optimal placement of the 'k' free roads to achieve the minimum transportation cost for all senators.

To correctly solve the task, we should take the following steps:

1. Build the tree from the provided edges.
2. Calculate the size of each subtree (i.e., the number of senators' aşezări that would use a road in their shortest path to the senate).
3. Find the node that will serve as the meeting place of the Senate, which should be on the path of the k free roads.
4. Calculate the total cost without any free streets. This is equal to the sum of the sizes of all subtrees minus 1 (the root node), because each senator, except the one at the senate location, will travel exactly once through each road to reach the senate.
5. Determine the savings from making k roads free by identifying the k most-used roads. This corresponds to finding the roads that, if made free, would reduce the total cost the most.
6. Deduct the savings from the total cost to get the final result.

To implement steps 3 and 5, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the most-used roads and decide which ones to make free. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal to calculate the subtree sizes and identify the roads to be made free.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct algorithm:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

def build_tree(edges):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    return tree

def dfs(tree, node, parent, subtree_sizes):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            subtree_sizes[node] += dfs(tree, child, node, subtree_sizes)
    return subtree_sizes[node]

def main():
    with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    
    tree = build_tree(edges)
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Calculate the size of subtrees using DFS
    dfs(tree, 1, -1, subtree_sizes)
    
    # Use a heap to identify the roads that will lead to the most savings if made free
    # The savings is proportional to the size of the subtree that uses that road
    heap = []
    for node in range(2, n + 1):
        heapq.heappush(heap, (-subtree_sizes[node], node))

    # Calculate the cost without any free roads
    total_cost = sum(subtree_sizes) - 1
    
    # Make k roads free, starting with the ones that have the most traffic
    savings = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        if heap:
            savings += -1 * heapq.heappop(heap)[0]
    
    # The final cost is the total cost minus the savings from making k roads free
    final_cost = total_cost - savings
    
    with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(final_cost) + '\n')

main()
```

This solution should produce the correct result. It properly calculates the subtree sizes, which represent the number of senators who will pass through that road to reach the senate. Then it selects the k roads that would offer the largest cost reduction if made free. The final result is the total cost minus the savings obtained from these free roads.

The result discrepancy arises from an incorrect calculation of the savings that can be made by providing free streets. The previous solutions did not correctly identify the k most beneficial roads to make free so as to minimize the total transportation cost. 

To resolve this, we must first identify the center of the tree, as this will minimize the distance all senators must travel. Making the k roads leading to this center free will provide the greatest savings. We need to compute the total cost if all senators travel without any free streets and then deduct the saving from making k roads free. The k roads made free should be the ones that connect the center to its k highest-subtree-size children.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from heapq import heappush, heappop

# Read the input from the file
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    return n, k, edges

# Write the output to the file
def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Build the tree from the input edges
def build_tree(n, edges):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    return tree

# Find the size of each subtree and calculate the initial total cost
def dfs(tree, node, parent, subtree_sizes):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1  # A subtree has at least the node itself
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:  # Only consider children, not the parent node
            subtree_sizes[node] += dfs(tree, child, node, subtree_sizes)
    return subtree_sizes[node]

# Main function to find the solution
def find_minimum_cost(n, k, edges):
    tree = build_tree(n, edges)
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    dfs(tree, 1, -1, subtree_sizes)  # Calculate subtree sizes starting from node 1

    # Push all edges into a max heap based on their subtree size
    max_heap = []
    for node in range(2, n + 1):  # 1 is the root, so start from 2
        heappush(max_heap, (-subtree_sizes[node], node))

    # Total initial cost if no roads were free
    total_cost = sum(subtree_sizes) - n

    # Computing savings by making 'k' roads free
    savings = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        if max_heap:
            savings -= heappop(max_heap)[0]
    
    return total_cost - savings

# Main execution
n, k, edges = read_input('cezar.in')
result = find_minimum_cost(n, k, edges)
write_output('cezar.out', result)
```

This solution ensures that:
- A tree data structure is built from the edges.
- A depth-first search (DFS) is performed to find the size of each subtree.
- The initial total transportation cost is calculated based on the size of the subtrees.
- A max heap is used to select the k most beneficial roads to be made free.
- The final cost is computed by subtracting the savings from the initial cost.

This corrected approach should yield the expected result, minimizing the total cost of transportation for the senators with the provision of k free streets.

The expected output indicates that the correct configuration of 'k' free streets and the senate location leads to a total cost of 11, while the found output from the last solution is 14. It seems the problem lies in how the 'k' free streets are chosen; the streets should be selected to optimize the travel for the majority of the senators, and not simply by the size of the subtrees.

To address the task correctly, we need to:

1. Find the node that minimizes the total distance from all other nodes. This node will be the location of the senate.
2. Determine the 'k' edges from the senate location that should be made free to maximize savings.
3. Calculate the total cost initially and then subtract the savings from the 'k' free edges.

One way to find the senate location is to pick a random node, find the furthest node from it, and then find the furthest node from that node. The midpoint of the path between these two furthest nodes is the optimal senate location. 

To find the 'k' edges to be made free, we can again use a subtree size approach, but this time we need to make sure to consider that the edges that should be made free are on the path from the chosen senate location to other nodes, prioritizing those with larger subtree sizes.

Let's revise and rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input data
def read_input():
    with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    return n, k, edges

# Function to perform DFS and find the furthest node
def dfs(tree, node, parent, depth, furthest_node):
    if depth > furthest_node[0]:
        furthest_node[0] = depth
        furthest_node[1] = node
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(tree, child, node, depth + 1, furthest_node)

# Function to build the tree
def build_tree(edges):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        tree[a].append(b)
        tree[b].append(a)
    return tree

# Function to find the optimal senate location and the list of subtree sizes
def find_senate_and_subtrees(tree, n):
    # Find furthest node from any node (pick 1 as the starting point)
    furthest_node = [-1, 0]  # [max_depth, node_id]
    dfs(tree, 1, -1, 0, furthest_node)
    # Find furthest node from the previous furthest node
    dfs(tree, furthest_node[1], -1, 0, furthest_node)
    
    # Perform a final DFS to get subtree sizes and find the senate location
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    dfs_find_senate(tree, furthest_node[1], -1, 0, furthest_node[0] // 2, subtree_sizes)
    return subtree_sizes, furthest_node[1]

# Function to perform DFS and find the senate location, also calculate subtree sizes
def dfs_find_senate(tree, node, parent, depth, senate_depth, subtree_sizes):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    if depth == senate_depth:
        senate_location = node
    else:
        senate_location = None
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            child_senate_location, child_size = dfs_find_senate(tree, child, node, depth + 1, senate_depth, subtree_sizes)
            subtree_sizes[node] += child_size
            if child_senate_location:
                senate_location = child_senate_location
    return senate_location, subtree_sizes[node]

# Main function to solve the problem
def main():
    n, k, edges = read_input()
    tree = build_tree(edges)
    subtree_sizes, senate_location = find_senate_and_subtrees(tree, n)
    
    # Compute savings by choosing k edges with largest subtree sizes
    savings = sum(sorted(subtree_sizes[1:], reverse=True)[:k])
    
    # Total cost is sum(subtree_sizes) - n - savings
    total_cost = sum(subtree_sizes[1:]) - n - savings
    with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(total_cost) + '\n')

main()
```

This revised solution calculates the subtree sizes while finding the optimal senate location and then subtracts the savings from making the 'k' most trafficked streets free, which should produce the expected output.

Upon re-evaluation, we can deduce that the key to this problem lies in determining the optimal location of the senate and then selecting the 'k' streets that should be made free in such a way that the overall cost paid by all senators is minimized.

The correct approach to solving this problem consists of the following steps:

1. Consider each node as a potential location for the senate.
2. Calculate the total cost for each node as the location of the senate.
3. For each node, find the 'k' most expensive streets (in terms of the total number of times they'd be used by all senators) that can be made free.
4. Subtract the cost of these 'k' streets from the total cost to get the minimized cost for that senate location.
5. Choose the senate location with the minimum overall cost.

To perform this efficiently, we can utilize a DFS traversal from each node to calculate the costs, and then we can use a max heap to keep track of the 'k' most expensive streets for the current senate location.

Let's correct the implementation with an appropriate solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

# Build the adjacency list for the graph
def build_tree(edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    return graph

# Depth First Search to find the number of nodes (senators) in each subtree
def dfs_count(graph, node, parent, counts):
    count = 1
    for child in graph[node]:
        if child != parent:
            child_count = dfs_count(graph, child, node, counts)
            counts[child] = child_count
            count += child_count
    return count

# Depth First Search to compute the total cost and identify the k most expensive streets
def dfs_cost(graph, node, parent, counts, heap, k):
    total_cost = 0
    for child in graph[node]:
        if child != parent:
            # Cost for each subtree is the number of senators that will use that street
            cost = counts[child]
            total_cost += cost
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-cost, child))
            total_cost += dfs_cost(graph, child, node, counts, heap, k)
    return total_cost

# Main function to find the minimum total cost
def find_minimum_cost(n, k, edges):
    graph = build_tree(edges)
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    dfs_count(graph, 1, -1, counts)  # Count the number of nodes in each subtree
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        heap = []
        total_cost = dfs_cost(graph, i, -1, counts, heap, k)
        
        # Make 'k' most expensive streets free
        while k > 0 and heap:
            total_cost += heapq.heappop(heap)[0]  # Subtract the cost since it's stored as negative
            k -= 1
        
        min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost)
    
    return min_cost

# Read input, process the graph, find the minimum cost and write the output
def main():
    with open('cezar.in', 'r') as fin:
        n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

    min_cost = find_minimum_cost(n, k, edges)

    with open('cezar.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{min_cost}\n")

main()
```

This solution performs a DFS from each node to calculate the total cost and identifies the 'k' most expensive streets that could be made free. The minimum cost among all nodes is chosen as the final answer. This should align the output with the expected result.
