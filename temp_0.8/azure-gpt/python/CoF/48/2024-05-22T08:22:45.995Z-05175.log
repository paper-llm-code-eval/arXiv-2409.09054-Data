În Roma antică există $n$ aşezări senatoriale distincte, câte una pentru fiecare dintre cei $n$ senatori ai Republicii. Aşezările senatoriale sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, între oricare două aşezări existând legături directe sau indirecte. O legătură este directă dacă ea nu mai trece prin alte aşezări senatoriale intermediare. Edilii au pavat unele dintre legăturile directe dintre două aşezări (numind o astfel de legătură pavată ”stradă“), astfel încât între oricare două aşezări senatoriale să existe o singură succesiune de străzi prin care se poate ajunge de la o aşezare senatorială la cealaltă.

Toţi senatorii trebuie să participe la şedinţele Senatului. In acest scop, ei se deplasează cu lectica. Orice senator care se deplasează pe o stradă plăteşte $1$ ban pentru că a fost transportat cu lectica pe acea stradă.

La alegerea sa ca prim consul, Cezar a promis că va dota Roma cu o lectică gratuită care să circule pe un număr de $k$ străzi ale Romei astfel încât orice senator care va circula pe străzile respective, să poată folosi lectica gratuită fără a plăti. Străzile pe care se deplasează lectica gratuită trebuie să fie legate între ele (zborul, metroul sau teleportarea nefiind posibile la acea vreme). 

În plus, Cezar a promis să stabilească sediul sălii de şedinţe a Senatului într-una dintre aşezările senatoriale aflate pe traseul lecticii gratuite. Problema este de a alege cele $k$ străzi şi amplasarea sediului sălii de şedinţe a Senatului astfel încât, prin folosirea transportului gratuit, senatorii, în drumul lor spre sala de şedinţe, să facă economii cât mai însemnate. În calculul costului total de transport, pentru toţi senatorii, Cezar a considerat că fiecare senator va călători exact o dată de la aşezarea sa până la sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care determină costul minim care se poate obţine prin alegerea adecvată a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului de amplasare a sălii de şedinţă a Senatului.

# Date de intrare 
Fişierul `cezar.in` conţine
- pe prima linie două valori $n\ k$ separate printr-un saţiu reprezentând numărul total de senatori şi numărul de strazi pe care circulă lectica gratuită
- pe următorele $n-1$ linii se află câte două valori $i\ j$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numerele de ordine a două aşezări senatoriale între care există stradă.

# Date de ieşire
Pe prima linie a fişierului `cezar.out` se va scrie costul total minim al transportării tuturor senatorilor pentru o alegere optimă a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului unde va fi amplasată sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Restricţii
* $1 < n ≤ 10\ 000, 0 < k < n$
* $1 ≤ i, j ≤ n , i ≠ j$
* Oricare două perechi de valori de pe liniile $2, 3, ..., n$ din fişierul de intrare reprezintă două străzi distincte.
* Perechile din fişierul de intrare sunt date astfel încât respectă condiţiile din problemă.
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $n ≤ 30$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $30 < n ≤ 1\ 000$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $1\ 000 < n ≤ 3\ 000$
* Pentru $10\%$ din teste $3\ 000 < n ≤ 5\ 000$  
* Pentru $10\%$ din teste $5\ 000 < n ≤ 10\ 000$.

Here's the updated Python solution that reads from `cezar.in` and writes to `cezar.out` without using `input()` or `print()`. The solution is encapsulated in a Markdown code block:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def bfs(start, adj):
    dist = [-1] * (n + 1)
    queue = deque([start])
    dist[start] = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return dist

def dfs(node, adj, visited, dist, k, chosen_streets):
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in adj[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if dist[neighbor] <= k:
                chosen_streets.append((node, neighbor))
            dfs(neighbor, adj, visited, dist, k, chosen_streets)

def find_farthest_node(dist):
    max_dist = max(dist)
    return dist.index(max_dist), max_dist

# Reading input from 'cezar.in'
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

# Finding node farthest from 1 (the tree root)
farthest_node, _ = find_farthest_node(bfs(1, adj))

# Finding the other end of the diameter
other_end, diameter = find_farthest_node(bfs(farthest_node, adj))

# Calculate minimum cost using the diameter of the tree
chosen_streets = []
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
dfs(other_end, adj, visited, bfs(other_end, adj), k, chosen_streets)

# Writing result to 'cezar.out'
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as fout:
    total_cost = n - 1 - len(chosen_streets)
    fout.write(f'{total_cost}\n')
```

This code snippet reads the input from a file named `cezar.in`, processes it as per the problem's requirement, and writes the output to a file named `cezar.out`. The solution finds the diameter of the tree (the longest path between any two nodes), then computes the minimum total cost based on the free k streets along this path.

Apologies for the confusion. The previous solution contained a logical error where it assumed that the most optimal streets to be chosen for the free lectica would be those along the diameter of the tree, which is not necessarily the case.

Here is a rewritten solution that uses a different approach:

1. We need to find the subtree count for each node.
2. We will then compute the savings for each edge, which is the number of nodes in the subtree that would save money if that edge was free.
3. We select the `k` edges with the highest savings and subtract their savings from the total cost.

This solution implements a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the subtree counts and potential savings, followed by a selection of the `k` most beneficial edges to make free.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to perform DFS and calculate subtree sizes and total savings
def dfs(node, parent):
    subtree_count[node] = 1
    savings = 0
    for neighbor in tree[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            savings += dfs(neighbor, node)
            subtree_count[node] += subtree_count[neighbor]
            edge_savings.append(subtree_count[neighbor] * (n - subtree_count[neighbor]))
    return savings + subtree_count[node] - 1  # Cost except for the current edge

# Reading input from 'cezar.in'
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = map(int, infile.readline().split())
        tree[a].append(b)
        tree[b].append(a)

# Initialize subtree counts and list to store savings per edge
subtree_count = [0] * (n + 1)
edge_savings = []

# Perform DFS to calculate subtree sizes and potential savings
dfs(1, -1)
edge_savings.sort(reverse=True)

# Calculate the total savings by making the k edges with the highest savings free
total_savings = sum(edge_savings[:k])

# Write the total cost after savings to 'cezar.out'
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{(n - 1) * 2 - total_savings}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly compute the minimal cost that can be obtained by choosing the appropriate `k` free streets and the location of the Senate meeting hall. The output is written to `cezar.out`.

Apologies for the oversight. Let's implement a correct algorithm to solve the problem. 

The correct approach for this problem is to find a subtree such that when k edges from this subtree to its parent are removed, we minimize the total distance traveled by the senators. 

Here's the revised solution:

1. Perform a DFS to compute the size of each subtree. 
2. Sort the edges by the number of nodes in the subtree (this represents the potential savings if this edge is free, since all senators in the subtree would save money).
3. Select the top k edges to maximize the savings.
4. Calculate the total cost by summing up the total edges and subtracting the savings from making k edges free.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input from 'cezar.in'
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]

# Initialize variables
adj = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edges:
    adj[u].append(v)
    adj[v].append(u)

# Recursive DFS to calculate the subtree sizes
subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
def dfs(node, parent):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            subtree_sizes[node] += dfs(child, node)
    return subtree_sizes[node]

dfs(1, -1)

# Calculate the initial total cost (without free lectica)
initial_cost = (n - 1) * 2

# Calculate savings for each edge and sort them
savings = [(min(subtree_sizes[u], subtree_sizes[v]) * 2) for u, v in edges]
savings.sort(reverse=True)

# Calculate total savings by making k edges free
total_savings = sum(savings[:k])

# Calculate the final total cost
final_cost = initial_cost - total_savings

# Write the result to 'cezar.out'
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{final_cost}\n")
``` 

This solution uses a depth-first search to determine the sizes of the subtrees and then identifies which edges would yield the most savings if made free. The final cost is the initial cost minus the savings for the top k beneficial edges. The result is then written to `cezar.out`.

My apologies for the error. Let's analyze the problem again and provide a corrected solution.

The correct approach involves finding the most cost-efficient edges to make free so that the senators save the most amount of money during their travel to the Senate. We should calculate the total cost first without any free streets, which is simply the sum of the distances each senator has to travel (distance from each node to the root of the tree, counting each edge twice since every senator has to travel to and from the Senate).

We will then calculate the savings each senator makes if a particular street is made free. To do so, we need to know the size of the subtree if the edge in question were removed and the lectica were to be placed on the street leading towards that subtree. Finally, we select the `k` most beneficial savings and subtract these from the total cost.

Here is a correct Python solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def dfs(node, parent):
    size[node] = 1  # Every node has at least a size of 1 (itself)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            dep[node] += dfs(neighbor, node)
            size[node] += size[neighbor]
    return size[node]

# Calculate savings if the edge to the parent is made free
def get_savings(node, parent):
    savings = 0
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            savings += get_savings(neighbor, node)
    if parent != 0:  # Non-root nodes
        savings_list.append(size[node] * (n - size[node]))
    return savings + size[node]

# Read the input from file
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = map(int, f.readline().split())
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)

# Prepare for DFS
size = [0] * (n + 1)
dep = [0] * (n + 1)
savings_list = []

# Run DFS to calculate sizes of subtrees
dfs(1, 0)

# Calculate savings for each senator if an edge is made free
get_savings(1, 0)

# Total cost without any free lectica
total_cost = sum(dep)

# Sort the list of savings and take the largest k savings to subtract from the total cost
savings_list.sort(reverse=True)
max_savings = sum(savings_list[:k])

# Write the result to 'cezar.out'
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{total_cost - max_savings}\n")
```

This code performs a DFS to compute the size of each subtree and the savings for each possible free street. It then chooses the `k` streets that provide the greatest savings and subtracts these from the total cost to get the minimum total cost. The result is written to the output file `cezar.out`.

Let's diagnose the issue and implement a corrected solution. The aim is to determine the minimum cost of transporting all senators to the Senate meeting hall, given that k streets can be made free. This task involves finding the optimal subtree within the tree that maximizes the savings when making k streets free.

We'll start by calculating the distance from each node to all other nodes using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The cost of transporting a senator from their settlement to the meeting hall is the sum of distances from their settlement to all other settlements. Then, we use a priority queue to determine which k streets, when made free, yield the maximum savings.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

def add_edge(adj, u, v):
    adj[u].append(v)
    adj[v].append(u)

def dfs(u, parent):
    size[u] = 1
    for v in adj[u]:
        if v != parent:
            depth[v] = depth[u] + 1
            dfs(v, u)
            size[u] += size[v]
            total_distance[0] += 2  # Each edge is counted twice

def pick_streets(u, parent):
    for v in adj[u]:
        if v != parent:
            pick_streets(v, u)
            # Push the difference between removing and keeping the edge (profit)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (depth[v] - (size[v] if depth[v] else 0), v))

with open('cezar.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    
    for _ in range(n-1):
        u, v = map(int, f.readline().split())
        add_edge(adj, u, v)

size = [0] * (n + 1)
depth = [0] * (n + 1)
total_distance = [0]
max_heap = []

dfs(1, -1)
pick_streets(1, -1)

savings = 0
for _ in range(k):
    if max_heap:
        savings += heapq.heappop(max_heap)[0]

with open('cezar.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{total_distance[0] - savings}\n")
```

This solution defines two DFS functions. The first (`dfs`) computes the size of each subtree and the total distance across all edges. The second (`pick_streets`) uses a priority queue (heap) to keep track of the most beneficial streets to make free. We then repeatedly pop from the heap to determine the `k` streets that provide the most savings. The output is the total distance minus the savings from making these streets free. The result is written to `cezar.out`.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's re-evaluate the problem and approach it with a fresh perspective.

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Build a tree from the input data.
2. Find the total number of payments without any free streets.
3. Calculate potential savings for each subtree.
4. Sort these savings in descending order.
5. Apply the k free streets to the top k savings.
6. Calculate the minimum total cost.

The most crucial step is determining the potential savings for each subtree, which will be `subtree_size * (n - subtree_size)`. This represents the savings if that subtree's connecting edge to the rest of the tree were made free, as each senator within the subtree would save their travel cost to the Senate outside of the subtree.

Here's the correct implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Perform a DFS to find the sizes of the subtrees and calculate savings
def dfs(node, parent):
    global total_payments
    subtree_size = 1
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            child_subtree_size = dfs(child, node)
            total_payments += child_subtree_size  # Payment for each edge
            potential_savings.append(child_subtree_size * (n - child_subtree_size))
            subtree_size += child_subtree_size
    return subtree_size

# Read input from 'cezar.in'
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

# Initialize variables
total_payments = 0  # Total number of payments without any free streets
potential_savings = []  # Potential savings for each subtree

# Run DFS starting from any node, here we start with node 1
dfs(1, -1)

# Sort potential savings in descending order
potential_savings.sort(reverse=True)

# Apply k free streets to the top k potential savings
max_savings = sum(potential_savings[:k])

# Calculate the minimum total cost
min_total_cost = total_payments - max_savings

# Write the result to 'cezar.out'
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_total_cost) + '\n')
```

This code calculates the savings for each edge if it were made free and sums up the largest `k` of them to find the maximum savings possible. It then subtracts this from the total payments to find the minimum total cost, which is written to `cezar.out`.
