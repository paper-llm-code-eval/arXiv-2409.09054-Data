Se consideră harta universului ca fiind o matrice cu $250$ de linii şi $250$ de coloane. În fiecare celulă se găseşte o aşa numită poartă stelară, iar în anumite celule se găsesc echipaje ale porţii stelare. La o deplasare, un echipaj se poate deplasa din locul în care se află în oricare alt loc în care se găseşte o a doua poartă, în cazul nostru în orice altă poziţie din matrice. Nu se permite situarea simultană a mai mult de un echipaj într-o celulă. La un moment dat un singur echipaj se poate deplasa de la o poartă stelară la alta.

# Cerință

Dându-se un număr $p$ de echipaje, pentru fiecare echipaj fiind precizate poziţia iniţială şi poziţia finală, determinaţi numărul minim de deplasări necesare pentru ca toate echipajele să ajungă din poziţia iniţială în cea finală.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `poarta.in` are următorul format:
- pe prima linie se află numărul natural $p$ reprezentând numărul echipaje.
- pe următoarele $p$ linii se află câte 4 numere naturale, primele două reprezentând coordonatele poziţiei iniţiale a unui echipaj (linie respectiv coloană), următoarele două reprezentând coordonatele poziţiei finale a aceluiaşi echipaj (linie respectiv coloană).

# Date de ieşire
Pe prima linie a fişierului de ieșire `poarta.out` se scrie un singur număr reprezentând numărul minim de deplasări necesar.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 < p < 5\ 000$
- Coordonatele poziţiilor iniţiale şi finale ale echipajelor sunt numere naturale din intervalul $[1, 250]$.
- **Atenție la cazurile când poziția inițială este identică cu cea finală!**
- Poziţiile iniţiale ale celor $p$ echipaje sunt distincte două câte două.
- Poziţiile finale ale celor $p$ echipaje sunt distincte două câte două.

Certainly! Below is the corrected Python code solution which now correctly reads from `poarta.in` and writes to `poarta.out`, without using `input()` or `print()` functions. The solution considers the constraints and follows the requirements from the challenge:

```markdown
```python
# Read the input data from 'poarta.in'
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    initial_final_positions = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]

# Initialize a dictionary to store the number of echipaje at each final position
final_positions = {}

# Process each echipaj's initial and final position
for initial_row, initial_col, final_row, final_col in initial_final_positions:
    # Increment the counter for the final position
    final_positions[(final_row, final_col)] = final_positions.get((final_row, final_col), 0) + 1

# Since each move can place an echipaj at its final position, the minimum number of moves
# is the number of echipaje, because initial positions are distinct
min_moves = p

# Write the output data to 'poarta.out'
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_moves}\n')
```
```

Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here is a complete solution that reads from `poarta.in` and writes to `poarta.out` as required.

```markdown
```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    return p, moves

def write_output(file_name, result):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def calculate_min_moves(p, moves):
    initial_positions = set()
    final_positions = set()
    
    for i in range(p):
        initial_positions.add(moves[i][:2])
        final_positions.add(moves[i][2:])
    
    return max(p - len(initial_positions & final_positions), 0)

# Read the input
p, moves = read_input('poarta.in')

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_min_moves(p, moves)

# Write the output
write_output('poarta.out', result)
```
```

This code defines three functions: `read_input` to read the data from `poarta.in`, `write_output` to write the result to `poarta.out`, and `calculate_min_moves` to calculate the minimum number of moves necessary. It uses sets to keep track of unique initial and final positions and calculates the number of moves based on the difference between the two sets, making sure to account for any overlaps (i.e., echipaje that start in their final position).

```python
# Efficient solution for the challenge

# Define a function to calculate the minimum number of moves.
def calculate_min_moves(teams):
    # Since each team can move directly to the final position, and no two teams have the same final positions,
    # each team will require exactly one move, unless the initial position is the same as the final position.
    return sum(1 for team in teams if team[:2] != team[2:])

# Read from 'poarta.in'.
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    teams = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]

min_moves = calculate_min_moves(teams)

# Write to 'poarta.out'.
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_moves) + '\n')
```
This solution reads the data from `poarta.in`, calculates the minimum number of moves needed for all teams to reach their final positions, and writes the result to `poarta.out`. It optimizes the calculation by realizing that each team can directly move to its final position in one move unless it's already at its final position.

My previous solution incorrectly assumed that each team can move directly to its final position in one move without considering that some teams might need to wait for others to vacate their desired final positions. The problem is essentially a matching problem where each team needs to move to a unique final position and the move can only be made if the target position is not currently occupied by another team.

To calculate the minimum number of moves, we can consider this as a permutation problem. We are given a permutation of teams' positions, and we need to sort this permutation using the minimum number of swaps, considering that each team can swap with any other.

Here's a fixed implementation:

```python
# Function to compute the minimum number of swaps needed
# to sort the permutation of final positions according to initial positions
def min_swaps(positions):
    n = len(positions)
    visited = [False] * n
    position_map = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(positions)}
    swaps = 0

    for i in range(n):
        # If the element is already in the correct position or already visited
        if visited[i] or position_map[i] == i:
            continue

        # Find the number of nodes in this cycle
        cycle_size = 0
        j = i
        while not visited[j]:
            visited[j] = True
            j = position_map[j]
            cycle_size += 1

        # Update total swaps needed for this cycle
        if cycle_size > 0:
            swaps += cycle_size - 1

    return swaps

# Read from 'poarta.in'
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    initial_to_final = dict()
    final_to_initial = [0] * p

    for i in range(p):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        initial_to_final[(x1, y1)] = i
        final_to_initial[i] = (x2, y2)

    # Map final positions back to their indices based on initial positions
    positions = [initial_to_final[final_to_initial[i]] for i in range(p)]

# Calculate the minimum number of swaps (moves) needed to sort the permutation
min_moves = min_swaps(positions)

# Write to 'poarta.out'
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_moves}\n')
```

This implementation creates a mapping from final positions to indices and then constructs a permutation array from initial positions to these indices. Then it calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to sort this permutation, which corresponds to the minimum number of moves needed for all teams to reach their final positions.

The program threw a `KeyError` because it attempted to access a key in the `initial_to_final` dictionary that didn't exist. The error occurs when mapping final positions back to their indices based on initial positions. The mistake is in presuming that each final position is a key in `initial_to_final`, which is not guaranteed.

To fix the program, we should directly create a permutation list where each index corresponds to an initial position and its value corresponds to the final position. Then, we can use this permutation list to calculate the minimum number of swaps needed to reach the sorted order where each team is in the correct final position.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to compute the minimum number of swaps needed
# to sort the permutation of final positions according to initial positions
def min_swaps(perm):
    visited = [False] * len(perm)
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(len(perm)):
        if visited[i] or perm[i] == i:
            continue
        cycle_size = 0
        j = i
        while not visited[j]:
            visited[j] = True
            j = perm[j]
            cycle_size += 1
        if cycle_size > 0:
            swaps += cycle_size - 1
    return swaps

# Read from 'poarta.in'
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    initial_positions = [None] * p
    final_positions = [None] * p

    for i in range(p):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().split())
        initial_positions[i] = (x1, y1)
        final_positions[(x2, y2)] = i

    # Create the permutation list based on final positions
    perm = [final_positions[pos] for pos in initial_positions]

# Calculate the minimum number of swaps (moves) needed to sort the permutation
min_moves = min_swaps(perm)

# Write to 'poarta.out'
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_moves}\n')
```

This solution should read the correct input from `poarta.in`, compute the number of moves correctly, and write the output to `poarta.out` without any errors.

The error is due to attempting to use a tuple as an index for a list, which is not allowed in Python. Lists are indexed by integers, not by tuples. To resolve this, instead of using a list for `final_positions`, we should use a dictionary, which allows us to use tuples as keys.

Here is the corrected solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
# Function to compute the minimum number of swaps needed
# to sort the permutation of final positions according to initial positions
def min_swaps(perm):
    visited = [False] * len(perm)
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(len(perm)):
        if visited[i] or perm[i] == i:
            continue
        cycle_size = 0
        j = i
        while not visited[j]:
            visited[j] = True
            j = perm[j]
            cycle_size += 1
        if cycle_size > 0:
            swaps += cycle_size - 1
    return swaps

# Read from 'poarta.in'
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline())
    initial_positions = [None] * p
    # Using a dictionary for final positions with tuples as keys
    final_positions = {}

    for i in range(p):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().split())
        initial_positions[i] = (x1, y1)
        final_positions[(x2, y2)] = i

    # Create the permutation list based on final positions
    perm = [final_positions[initial_positions[i]] for i in range(p)]

# Calculate the minimum number of swaps (moves) needed to sort the permutation
min_moves = min_swaps(perm)

# Write to 'poarta.out'
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_moves}\n')
```

This modified code uses a dictionary for `final_positions` where the keys are tuples representing the final positions, and the values are the indices of the teams. We then create a permutation list using these positions and calculate the minimum number of swaps accordingly. The output is then written to `poarta.out`.
