Un atelier de fabricat ceasuri cu cuc are nevoie de plăcuțe cu numerele pentru orele pe care trebuie să le așeze pe discul ceasurilor. Aceste numere sunt realizate la o imprimantă.

Din cauza unei erori imprimanta tipărește plăcuțe cu numere naturale, unele mai mari ca $12$. Atelierul poate utiliza doar plăcuțe cu numere cuprinse ı̂ntre $0$ și $12$. Pentru a utiliza aceste numere este nevoie ca ele să fie tăiate ı̂ncepând din partea dreaptă ı̂n grupuri de maximum două cifre, fiecare grup reprezentând valoarea de pe o plăcuță, care să fie o cifră la $0$ la $9$ sau unul dintre numerele $10$, $11$, $12$. Dacă pe o plăcuță se găsește un număr mai mare ca $12$ atunci plăcuța trebuie tăiată, astfel ı̂ncât ı̂n urma tăierii să se obțină numere de cel mult $2$ cifre. Dacă ı̂n numărul de pe o plăcuță cifra zecilor este $0$, atunci la prima tăiere se ia doar cifra unităților, altfel dacă numărul format cu cifra zecilor și unităților este mai mare ca $12$, atunci se taie prima dată cifra unităților, iar dacă numărul format cu cifra zecilor și unităților este $10$, $11$ sau $12$ se taie prima dată numărul format din ultimele două cifre, apoi procedeul se repetă până la tăierea completă a plăcuței. Imprimanta a realizat N plăcuțe. De exemplu dacă plăcuța este $12030$, după tăiere se obțin $0$, $3$, $0$, $12$.

# Cerință
1. Determinați numărul total de apariții ale cifrei $X$ pe plăcuțe ı̂nainte de tăiere.
2. Determinați numărul de tăieturi realizate conform enunțului.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului `ceas.in` se află valorile $C$, $X$ și $N$ separate prin câte un singur spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin câte un singur spațiu, având semnificația din enunț. Pentru $C = 1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$, iar pentru $C = 2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `ceas.out` conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural care reprezintă valoarea calculată conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq X \leq 9$;
* Valorile din șir sunt numere naturale $\leq 50 \ 000$;
* Pentru testele în care avem $C = 2$ valoarea $X$ este prezentă în fișierul de intrare chiar dacă nu este folosită în rezolvare.
* Pentru teste în valoare de $39$ de puncte avem $C = 1$
* Pentru teste în valoare de $61$ de puncte avem $C = 2$

# Read input data from ceas.in

    while number > 0:

            cuts += 1
        else:
            number //= 10
            cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Check which part to solve based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    # Solve for the number of appearances of X before cutting
    total_appearances = sum(count_digit(plate, X) for plate in plates)
    result = total_appearances
elif C == 2:
    # Solve for the number of cuts

    result = total_cuts

# Write the result to ceas.out
with open('ceas.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution reads the values from `ceas.in`, determines the appropriate action to take based on the value of C, and writes the result to `ceas.out`. It uses two helper functions: one for counting the appearances of a digit and another one for simulating the cutting process.

The original solution for counting the number of cuts is incorrect. The cutting process was not properly implemented according to the rules specified in the challenge description:

- When a number is greater than 100, we start by cutting off groups of two digits from the right.
- If the last two digits form a number greater than 12, cut off the last digit.
- If the last two digits form a number equal to or less than 12, cut off the last two digits.
- When a number is less than or equal to 100, just apply the second and third rules.

Let's correct this behavior in the perform_cutting function and write the entire solution again.

```python
# Read input data from ceas.in
with open('ceas.in', 'r') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    plates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables to store outcomes
total_appearances = 0
total_cuts = 0

# Define the function to count appearances of a digit
def count_digit(number, digit):
    return str(number).count(str(digit))

# Define the function to perform the cutting process
def perform_cutting(number):
    cuts = 0
    while number > 0:
        if number < 10:
            # If the number is a single digit, cut it directly.
            cuts += 1
            break
        elif 10 <= number % 100 <= 12:
            # If the last two digits form a valid plate number (10 to 12), cut them.
            number //= 100
            cuts += 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, cut the last digit.
            number //= 10
            cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Check which part to solve based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    # Solve for the number of appearances of X before cutting
    total_appearances = sum(count_digit(plate, X) for plate in plates)
    result = total_appearances
elif C == 2:
    # Solve for the number of cuts
    total_cuts = sum(perform_cutting(plate) for plate in plates)
    result = total_cuts

# Write the result to ceas.out
with open('ceas.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This corrected solution should now properly handle the cutting process according to the rules, which will fix the bug in the number of cuts calculation and produce the correct output.

The new implementation of the `perform_cutting` function still seems to have a problem in the algorithm. 

The rules for cutting are:
- If the last two digits (when considered as a separate number) are 10, 11, or 12, then that number is a valid cut.
- Otherwise, cut the last digit (which is always a valid single-digit number).
- If the number becomes a single digit at any point, we're done cutting since any single-digit number is valid.

Let's adjust the algorithm to follow these rules:

1. If the last digit is zero and the number is greater than 10, cut the last digit (the zero).
2. If the last two digits make a number from 10 to 12, cut these two digits.
3. Otherwise, cut the last digit.
4. Repeat the process until the whole number is processed.

```python
# Read input data from ceas.in
with open('ceas.in', 'r') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    plates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables to store outcomes
total_appearances = 0
total_cuts = 0

# Define the function to perform the cutting process
def perform_cutting(number):
    cuts = 0
    while number > 0:
        last_two_digits = number % 100
        if last_two_digits == 0 and number > 10:
            # If the last digit is zero and the number is greater than 10, cut the zero.
            number //= 10
        elif 10 <= last_two_digits <= 12:
            # If the last two digits are 10, 11, or 12, cut these two digits.
            number //= 100
        else:
            # Otherwise, cut the last digit.
            number //= 10
        cuts += 1  # A cut was made in any case.
    return cuts

# Check which part to solve based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    # Solve for the number of appearances of X before cutting
    total_appearances = sum(count_digit(plate, X) for plate in plates)
    result = total_appearances
elif C == 2:
    # Solve for the number of cuts
    total_cuts = sum(perform_cutting(plate) for plate in plates)
    result = total_cuts

# Write the result to ceas.out
with open('ceas.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution should now handle the cutting process correctly and produce the expected output.

The error message indicates that the `count_digit` function is not defined, which explains why the program exited with code 1. The original mention of the `count_digit` function was in the previous iterations that I provided, but in the latest version, the function was not included in the code block.

To fix the program, we need to redefine the `count_digit` function and correct the logic in the `perform_cutting` function to ensure it follows the rules for cutting specified in the problem description. Here is the corrected and complete solution:

```python
def count_digit(number, digit):
    return str(number).count(str(digit))

def perform_cutting(number):
    cuts = 0
    while number > 9:
        last_digit = number % 10
        next_to_last_digit = (number // 10) % 10

        if next_to_last_digit == 0 or next_to_last_digit > 1:
            number //= 10
        else:
            if next_to_last_digit == 1 and last_digit <= 2:
                number //= 100
            else:
                number //= 10
        cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Read input data from ceas.in
with open('ceas.in', 'r') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    plates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables to store outcomes
result = 0

# Check which part to solve based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    # Solve for the number of appearances of X before cutting
    result = sum(count_digit(plate, X) for plate in plates)
elif C == 2:
    # Solve for the number of cuts
    result = sum(perform_cutting(plate) for plate in plates)

# Write the result to ceas.out
with open('ceas.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This revised solution includes the `count_digit` function and corrects the `perform_cutting` function to follow the cutting rules. It should now correctly count the total number of appearances of the digit X before cutting (if C is 1) and the total number of cuts made (if C is 2), then write the correct output to `ceas.out`.

After reviewing the logic of the `perform_cutting` function and the rules, it seems that the function didn't adequately handle the cases where the two-digit number is less than 10 (since it would have a leading zero) and also when cutting digits from numbers with more than two digits.

Let's correct the function according to the rules:
- If the number is greater than 100, we need to look at the last two digits.
- If the last two digits form a number that is less than or equal to 12, then we can cut off these two digits.
- If the last two digits form a number greater than 12, or if the last two digits form a number less than 10 (which would be a leading zero), we cut off only the last digit.

Additionally, I will include a condition that says if the number is less than 10 (a single digit), it doesn't need to be cut.

Here's the corrected perform_cutting function and the complete solution:

```python
def perform_cutting(number):
    cuts = 0
    while number > 9:
        last_two_digits = number % 100
        if 10 <= last_two_digits <= 12:
            number //= 100
        else:
            number //= 10
        cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Read input data from ceas.in
with open('ceas.in', 'r') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    plates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables to store outcomes
result = 0

# Check which part to solve based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    # Solve for the number of appearances of X before cutting
    result = sum(str(plate).count(str(X)) for plate in plates)
elif C == 2:
    # Solve for the number of cuts
    result = sum(perform_cutting(plate) for plate in plates)

# Write the result to ceas.out
with open('ceas.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

With this correction, the function should now handle all cases correctly, and the program should output the expected number of cuts for the given input.

It appears that the `perform_cutting` function still does not correctly handle the cases where the number has leading zeros after cutting. According to the rules, if the tens digit is 0 and the number is greater than 10, only the units digit should be cut. We must adjust the algorithm to account for this scenario.

Let's correct the implemented logic in `perform_cutting`:

1. If the last two digits are less than or equal to 12 (but not a single 0), cut both digits.
2. If the last two digits are greater than 12 or the tens place is 0, cut only the last digit.

Here is the corrected solution with the proper cutting logic:

```python
# Function to perform cutting according to the specified rules
def perform_cutting(number):
    cuts = 0
    while number > 0:
        last_digit = number % 10
        # Case where number is a single digit or last two digits are <= 12
        if (number < 10) or (10 <= (number % 100) <= 12):
            number //= 100
        # Case where the tens digit is 0 (leading zero after cut) or last two digits > 12
        else:
            number //= 10
        cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Read input data from ceas.in
with open('ceas.in', 'r') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    plates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Determine which part to solve based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    # Solve for the number of appearances of X before cutting
    result = sum(str(plate).count(str(X)) for plate in plates)
elif C == 2:
    # Solve for the number of cuts
    result = sum(perform_cutting(plate) for plate in plates)

# Write the result to ceas.out
with open('ceas.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution should now correctly implement the cutting rules and produce the expected number of cuts for the given input.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it's clear that the issue lies in the `perform_cutting` function, which doesn't implement the problem constraints correctly. The main issue is that we're not handling the cutting of zeros correctly when they appear as tens digits.

According to the problem statement:
- If the tens digit is '0', you should cut only the unit digit (unless it's the only digit left).
- If the tens digit together with the unit digit forms a number from 10 to 12, cut both digits.
- If the number is a single digit, no cut is needed.

Let's apply these rules correctly in the `perform_cutting` function:

```python
# Function to perform cutting according to the specified rules
def perform_cutting(number):
    cuts = 0
    while number > 9: # Continue if the number has more than one digit
        last_two_digits = number % 100
        tens_digit = (number // 10) % 10
        # Cut only the unit digit if tens digit is '0' (but not if it's the only digit left)
        if tens_digit == 0 and number > 9:
            number //= 10
        # Cut both digits if they form a number from 10 to 12
        elif 10 <= last_two_digits <= 12:
            number //= 100
        # Otherwise, cut the last digit only
        else:
            number //= 10
        cuts += 1 # Increment the cut count
    return cuts

# Read input data from ceas.in
with open('ceas.in', 'r') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    plates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Solve for the required output based on the value of C
result = 0
if C == 1:
    # Count the occurrences of X before cutting
    result = sum(str(plate).count(str(X)) for plate in plates)
elif C == 2:
    # Count the total number of cuts
    result = sum(perform_cutting(plate) for plate in plates)

# Write the result to ceas.out
with open('ceas.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

With this logic, we should now correctly handle all cases of cutting, and the output should match the expected result. This corrected solution should output the correct number of cuts for the provided input data.
