Gică și Lică lucrează la o fabrică de jucării, în schimburi diferite. Anul acesta patronul fabricii a hotărât să confecționeze și mărțișoare. Mărțișoarele gata confecționate sunt puse în cutii numerotate consecutiv. Cutiile sunt aranjate în ordinea strict crescătoare și consecutivă a numerelor de pe acestea. Gică trebuie să ia, în ordine, fiecare cutie, să lege la fiecare mărțișor câte un șnur alb-roșu și apoi să le pună la loc în cutie.

În fiecare schimb, Gică scrie pe o tablă magnetică, utilizând cifre magnetice, în ordine strict crescătoare, numerele cutiilor pentru care a legat șnururi la mărțișoare. Când se termină schimbul lui Gică, Lică, care lucrează în schimbul următor, vine și ambalează cutiile cu numerele de pe tablă și le trimite la magazine. Totul merge ca pe roate, până într-o zi, când, două cifre de pe tablă se demagnetizează și cad, rămânând două locuri goale. Lică observă acest lucru, le ia de jos și le pune la întâmplare pe tablă, în cele două locuri goale. Singurul lucru de care ține cont este acela că cifra $0$ nu poate fi prima cifră a unui număr.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să citească numerele naturale $N$ (reprezentând numărul de numere scrise pe tablă) și $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_N$ (reprezentând numerele scrise, în ordine, pe tablă, după ce Lică a completat cele două locuri goale cu cifrele căzute) și care să determine:

* cele două cifre care au fost schimbate între ele, dacă, după ce au completat locurile goale, acestea au schimbat șirul numerelor scrise de Gică;
* numărul maxim scris pe tablă de Gică.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `martisoare.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$ reprezentând numărul de numere de pe tablă. A doua linie a fișierului conține, în ordine, cele $N$ numere $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_N$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând, în ordine, numerele existente pe tablă, după ce Lică a completat cele două locuri libere cu cifrele căzute.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `martisoare.out` va conține pe prima linie două cifre, în ordine crescătoare, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând cele două cifre care au fost schimbate între ele sau `0 0` în cazul în care cele două cifre magnetice căzute, după ce au fost puse înapoi pe tablă, nu au schimbat șirul numerelor scrise de Gică. A doua linie va conține un număr reprezentând numărul maxim din secvența de numere consecutive scrisă de Gică pe tablă.

# Restricții și precizări

* $4 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $N$, $c_1$, $c_2$, $\dots$, $c_N$ sunt numere naturale;
* cele două cifre care cad de pe tablă pot proveni din același număr;

The issue with the previous code is that it incorrectly assumes that the first decrease in the sequence indicates the swapped digits. However, we cannot directly infer the swapped digits from the first decrease because the two digits that fell and were misplaced could come from anywhere in the sequence.

To correctly identify the swapped digits, we need to reconstruct the original sequence by looking at the sequence of numbers that were incorrectly placed. We should find the point where the sequence breaks the increasing order, and then determine the possible original digits. The largest possible value for the digit at the break point (which should be a smaller digit) would be swapped with the smallest possible value for the digit that follows the break point (which should be a larger digit).

Let's rewrite the solution considering this logic:

```python
# Read data from "martisoare.in"
with open("martisoare.in", "r") as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, infile.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the two swapped digits
# Now we need to find the first pair of numbers that are out of order
swapped = []
for i in range(1, N):
    if numbers[i] < numbers[i - 1]:
        swapped = [min(str(numbers[i - 1])) , max(str(numbers[i]))]
        break

# Sort the swapped digits to ensure ascending order as per the output requirement
swapped.sort()

# The maximum number in Gica's sequence will be the last number before the swap, with corrected digits
max_number = numbers[i - 1]  # The last number before the swap
# If there was a swap, we need to replace the smaller digit with the larger one to find the maximum
if swapped:
    str_max_number = str(max_number)
    # Replace the first occurrence of the smaller digit with the larger one to correct the last number
    max_number = int(str_max_number.replace(swapped[0], swapped[1], 1))

# Write the output to "martisoare.out"
with open("martisoare.out", "w") as outfile:
    if swapped:
        outfile.write(f"{swapped[0]} {swapped[1]}\n{max_number}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write("0 0\n")
        outfile.write(f"{max_number}\n")
```

This code should correctly identify the two swapped digits and compute the maximum number by restoring the sequence. It reads from "martisoare.in" and writes to "martisoare.out" while avoiding the use of `input()` or `print()` as per the challenge requirements.

The previous solution still contained incorrect logic for the identification of the swapped digits. The approach to determining the two digits by simply taking the minimum and maximum of the out-of-order pair is not correct. We must consider the fact that after the two digits fell, they were placed back at random positions, so the sequence could have been altered in a way that is not necessarily a direct swap.

To correctly identify the swapped digits, we need to carefully examine the positions where the numbers are out of the expected increasing order. The first such position gives us one of the digits, and we need to find the other digit that would make the sequence correct.

Additionally, for finding the maximum number, we need to consider that the correct number sequence might contain the swapped digits more than once, and we need to fix all occurrences of the incorrect digit in the last number before the swap occurred.

Let's correct the solution accordingly:

```python
def find_swapped_digits(numbers):
    orig_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    swapped = []

    for a, b in zip(numbers, orig_numbers):
        if a != b:
            swapped.append(str(a))
            swapped.append(str(b))
    
    # If there is no digit swapped or more than two, return 0 0
    if len(swapped) != 4:
        return [0, 0]
    
    # extract the differing digits
    diff = []
    for i in range(4):
        if swapped[i] not in swapped[:i] + swapped[i+1:]:
            diff.append(swapped[i])
    
    return sorted(diff)

# Read data from "martisoare.in"
with open("martisoare.in", "r") as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, infile.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the two swapped digits
swapped = find_swapped_digits(numbers)

# The maximum number in Gica's sequence can be determined by reconstructing the sequence
# with the swapped digits. We can start from the largest number and decrease it until
# we find a number that fits the sequence.

# We first correct the last number in the sequence by swapping the digits back
max_number = numbers[-1]
if swapped != [0, 0]:
    str_max_number = str(max_number)
    if swapped[1] in str_max_number:
        max_number = int(str_max_number.replace(swapped[1], swapped[0], 1))

# Write the output to "martisoare.out"
with open("martisoare.out", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{swapped[0]} {swapped[1]}\n{max_number}\n")
```

In this updated solution, we first find the two swapped digits by comparing the altered sequence with the sorted sequence and identifying the two differing digits. We then correct the last number in the sequence by swapping the digits back to their original places if necessary. This code should produce the expected output.

It appears that the previous attempt to find the swapped digits was incorrect because it did not account for the fact that the sequence of numbers mentioned in the problem statement is strictly consecutive. To correct this, we need to carefully analyze the numerical sequence to identify the two swapped digits.

To find the two swapped digits, we need to look at where the sequence breaks its consecutiveness. The broken sequence will help us identify the incorrect digits. The logic is as follows:

1. Identify the index where the sequence breaks.
2. Use this break to determine the two incorrect digits.
3. Replace the incorrect digits in the last number before the sequence broke to find Gică's maximum number.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def find_swapped_digits_and_max_number(numbers):
    # Identify where the sequence breaks
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] != numbers[i - 1] + 1:
            break
    else:
        # If no break is found, the sequence is already correct
        return '0 0', numbers[-1]

    # Use the break to find the incorrect and correct digits
    incorrect_digit = str(numbers[i])[0]
    correct_digit = str(numbers[i - 1] + 1)[0]

    # Replace the incorrect digit in the last number before the break
    max_number_str = str(numbers[i - 1]).replace(incorrect_digit, correct_digit, 1)
    max_number = int(max_number_str)

    # Return the swapped digits in ascending order and the max number
    return f'{min(incorrect_digit, correct_digit)} {max(incorrect_digit, correct_digit)}', max_number

# Read data from "martisoare.in"
with open("martisoare.in", "r") as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, infile.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the two swapped digits and max number
swapped_digits, max_number = find_swapped_digits_and_max_number(numbers)

# Write the output to "martisoare.out"
with open("martisoare.out", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{swapped_digits}\n{max_number}\n")
```

This updated solution first identifies the index where the sequence breaks from being strictly consecutive. It then uses this information to deduce the incorrect and correct digits. Finally, it corrects the last number before the break by replacing the incorrect digit with the correct one, which gives us Gică's maximum number. The output is written to "martisoare.out" in the expected format.

The previous solution incorrectly calculated the maximum number Gică could have written on the board, which should be the largest consecutive number before the sequence was disrupted by the swapped digits. The mistake was in the replacement strategy used to correct the last number before the sequence broke.

Let's fix this by refining the approach:

1. Find the index where the sequence breaks its strict consecutiveness.
2. Identify the two digits that were mistakenly swapped (which caused the break in the sequence).
3. Correctly determine the maximum number in the sequence by checking the sequence from the point of the break.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from "martisoare.in"
with open("martisoare.in", "r") as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, infile.readline().strip().split()))

# Function to detect the swapped digits and the break in sequence.
def find_swapped_digits_and_break(numbers):
    for i in range(N-1):
        if numbers[i] > numbers[i+1]:
            return (i, numbers[i], numbers[i+1])
    return (N-1, numbers[N-2], numbers[N-1])  # No swap detected

break_index, num_before_break, num_after_break = find_swapped_digits_and_break(numbers)

# Function to find the swapped digits given the two numbers around the break point.
def get_swapped_digits(num1, num2):
    num1_digits = list(str(num1))
    num2_digits = list(str(num2))
    for i, digit in enumerate(num1_digits):
        if num2_digits[i] != digit:
            return ''.join(sorted([num2_digits[i], digit]))
    return '00'  # No difference found, shouldn't happen

swapped_digits = get_swapped_digits(num_before_break, num_after_break)

# Find the max Gica's number
max_number = numbers[0] if break_index == 0 else numbers[break_index - 1]

# Write the output to "martisoare.out"
with open("martisoare.out", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{swapped_digits}\n{max_number}\n")
```

This solution reads the input from "martisoare.in", processes the data to identify the break in sequence and the swapped digits, calculates the maximum number Gică could have written, and finally writes the output to "martisoare.out" in the expected format. It should now correctly produce the expected output for the given input.

The provided solution has a critical bug in identifying the two swapped digits. The logic for finding the swapped digits doesn't correctly identify which digits have been swapped. We need to reconsider the problem and approach it more systematically.

Here's the corrected strategy:

1. Given the sequence is initially strictly increasing by 1, we look for the pair of consecutive numbers where the first is greater than the second. This indicates the position where the digits were swapped.
2. The first incorrect digit is the first digit of the smaller number which is at the second position of the pair.
3. The second incorrect digit is the last digit of the first number of the next pair that is smaller than its predecessor.
4. To find the maximum number written by Gică, we have to reconstruct the sequence up to the point where the digits were swapped, which could be at the break or before it if the swapped digit caused earlier numbers to be out of the sequence.

Let's put this corrected logic into code:

```python
# Read data from "martisoare.in"
with open("martisoare.in", "r") as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, infile.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize variables to store the two swapped digits.
first_swapped_digit = None
second_swapped_digit = None

# Iterate over the numbers to find the pair where the sequence breaks.
for i in range(1, N):
    if numbers[i] < numbers[i-1]:  # The sequence is broken here.
        # The first swapped digit is the first digit of the current (smaller) number.
        first_swapped_digit = str(numbers[i])[0]
        # The second swapped digit is the last digit of the previous (larger) number.
        second_swapped_digit = str(numbers[i-1])[-1]
        break

# Sort the swapped digits to ensure ascending order as per the output requirement.
swapped_digits = ' '.join(sorted([first_swapped_digit, second_swapped_digit]))

# The maximum number in Gica's sequence is the number before the break minus one.
# It's minus one because the break occurred after the number was incremented.
max_number = numbers[i-1] - 1

# Write the output to "martisoare.out"
with open("martisoare.out", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{swapped_digits}\n{max_number}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly identify the swapped digits and calculate the maximum number in the sequence, adhering to the problem's specifications. It reads from "martisoare.in" and writes to "martisoare.out" as required.

The last attempt still did not correctly identify the swapped digits and the maximum number in Gică's sequence. Let's rethink the problem and address the solution step by step:

1. Find the first place where the sequence does not increase by 1, which indicates where the digits have been swapped.

2. Identify the two incorrect digits by comparing each digit of the number at the identified place with its predecessor number.

3. Find the original maximum number that Gică wrote by examining the numbers starting from the point of decrease back to the point where the sequence was last correct (which should be either the same as the identified number or less by exactly one if the swapped digit caused the increase).

Let's implement the corrected logic:

```python
# Read data from "martisoare.in"
with open("martisoare.in", "r") as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, infile.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the place where the sequence breaks
for i in range(1, N):
    if numbers[i] != numbers[i-1] + 1:
        break_index = i
        break
else:
    # If the loop doesn't break, it means the sequence is correct, and no digits were swapped
    break_index = 0

# If we have identified a break in the sequence
if break_index:
    # The incorrect digit is the first digit of the current (smaller) number
    incorrect_digit = str(numbers[break_index])[0]
    # Find the second swapped digit by checking the last correct number before the break
    for i in range(break_index - 1, -1, -1):
        if incorrect_digit not in str(numbers[i]):
            correct_digit = incorrect_digit
            incorrect_digit = str(numbers[i+1])[0]
            break
        correct_digit = str(numbers[i])[-1]
else:
    incorrect_digit = correct_digit = '0'

# Sort the swapped digits to ensure ascending order as per the output requirement
swapped_digits = f"{min(incorrect_digit, correct_digit)} {max(incorrect_digit, correct_digit)}"

# The maximum number in Gica's sequence is either the last number before the break
# or the last correct number if the swapped digit caused an earlier increase
max_number = numbers[break_index - 1]
if correct_digit in str(max_number):
    max_number -= 1

# Write the output to "martisoare.out"
with open("martisoare.out", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{swapped_digits}\n{max_number}\n")
```

This revised solution should correctly identify the swapped digits and the maximum number in Gică's sequence, and write the expected output to "martisoare.out".
