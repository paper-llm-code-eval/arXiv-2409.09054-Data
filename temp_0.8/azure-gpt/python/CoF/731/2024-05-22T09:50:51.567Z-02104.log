Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

    return min_stops, chosen_path

        file_out.write('0\n')
    else:
        file_out.write(f'{stops} {path_number}\n')
```

This code implements the logic described earlier and adheres to the constraints of the challenge. It reads from `popas.in` and writes to `popas.out` as required. It avoids using `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations.

It seems that the issue is that the input file reading logic is incorrect, specifically the line where `t` and `u` are being read. The `file_in.readlines()[:-2]` part is skipping the last two lines, where `t` and `u` are supposed to be. As a result, when trying to read the next line for `t` and `u`, it reads an empty line and raises a `ValueError`.

To fix the problem, I'll adjust the file reading logic to correctly read all the lines including the last two lines to get the values for `t` and `u`.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    chosen_path = -1
    for path in reversed(trails):
        i, sources = path[0], path[2:]
        stops, dist_covered = 0, 0
        for source in sources:
            if dist_covered + t < source:
                stops += 1
                dist_covered = source
            if source - dist_covered > t:
                stops = float('inf')
                break
        if dist_covered + t + u < 1:
            stops += 1
        if stops < min_stops:
            min_stops, chosen_path = stops, i
    return min_stops, chosen_path

with open('popas.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k = int(file_in.readline())
    trails = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file_in]
    t, u = trails[-2][0], trails[-1][0]
    trails = trails[:-2]

stops, path_number = find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u)

with open('popas.out', 'w') as file_out:
    if stops == float('inf'):
        file_out.write('0\n')
    else:
        file_out.write(f'{stops} {path_number}\n')
```

This code will read all lines from `popas.in`, correctly parse `t` and `u` from the last two lines, and write the correct output to `popas.out`.

The logic to choose the most recently listed path in case of a tie is incorrect. The issue is that I'm not properly handling the "If there are multiple paths with the same minimum number of stops, choose the one that is written last in the input file" condition. The current code chooses the path with the minimum stops but does not prioritize the most recently listed (last written) path in case of ties.

Here's the revised solution that fixes the issue:

```python
def find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    chosen_path = -1
    # Iterate through the trails in reverse, as the last one should be chosen in case of a tie
    for path in reversed(trails):
        i, r, *sources = path
        stops = 0
        dist_since_last_stop = 0
        for source in sources:
            # Check if the hiker can reach the next source without stopping
            if dist_since_last_stop + t < source:
                stops += 1
                dist_since_last_stop = source
            # If the source is too far from the last stop, it's not a valid path
            if source - dist_since_last_stop > t:
                stops = float('inf')
                break
        # Check if the hiker can reach the peak from the last stop/source
        if stops != float('inf') and dist_since_last_stop + t + u < 1:
            stops += 1
        # Choose the path with the fewest stops or the most recently listed one in case of a tie
        if stops <= min_stops:
            min_stops, chosen_path = stops, i
            
    return min_stops, chosen_path

# Read from popas.in
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file_in.readlines()[:k]]
    t, u = map(int, file_in.readline().split())

# Find the path with the minimum number of stops
stops, path_number = find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u)

# Write to popas.out
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file_out:
    if stops == float('inf'):
        file_out.write('0\n')
    else:
        file_out.write(f'{stops} {path_number}\n')
```

This revised solution iterates the trails in reverse order to fulfill the requirement that the most recently listed path should be chosen in case of ties. It correctly reads `t` and `u` from the input file and writes the output to `popas.out` as expected.

The error occurs because the logic for reading `t` and `u` assumes they are on separate lines, but they are actually on the same line. The loop that reads the trails also reads the line containing `t` and `u`, leaving nothing to read when `map(int, file_in.readline().split())` is called, resulting in a `ValueError`.

I will fix the logic by adjusting the range of the loop that reads the trails to exclude the last two lines, and reading `t` and `u` correctly after the loop.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u):
    # Initialize the minimum number of stops and chosen path variables
    min_stops = float('inf')
    chosen_path = -1
    # Iterate through the trails
    for path in reversed(trails):
        i, r, *sources = path
        stops = 0
        # Start from the base with a full bottle
        dist_since_last_stop = t
        # Iterate through the sources
        for source in sources:
            # Check if the source can be reached from the last stop
            if dist_since_last_stop < source:
                # Make a stop if the source cannot be reached
                stops += 1
                dist_since_last_stop = source + t  # Reset the distance since the last stop
            # If the source is too far from the last stop, it's not a valid path
            elif source + t < dist_since_last_stop:
                stops = float('inf')
                break
        # Check if the peak can be reached from the last source without stopping
        if stops != float('inf') and dist_since_last_stop < 1:
            # Make a stop if the peak cannot be reached
            stops += 1
        # Check if the current path requires fewer stops than the previously found path
        if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and i > chosen_path):
            min_stops = stops
            chosen_path = i
    
    return min_stops if min_stops != float('inf') else 0, chosen_path

# Read from popas.in
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file_in.readlines()[:k]]
    t, u = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())

# Find the path with the minimum number of stops
stops, path_number = find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u)

# Write to popas.out
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f'{stops} {path_number}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly read the input file, handle the logic for determining the path with the minimum number of stops, and output the result to `popas.out`.

The error persists because the same mistake was made again in the input reading logic. The loop that reads the trails should only iterate `k` times, leaving the last two values for `t` and `u` to be read separately. However, I mistakenly tried to read them within the same loop.

Here is the corrected solution that will read the `k` trails and then separately read `t` and `u`:

```python
def find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    chosen_path = -1

    for path in trails:
        i, r, *sources = path
        stops = 0
        dist_since_last_fill = 0
        for source in sources:
            if dist_since_last_fill + t < source:
                stops += 1
                dist_since_last_fill = source
        if dist_since_last_fill + t + u < 1:
            stops += 1
        if stops <= min_stops:
            min_stops = stops
            chosen_path = i

    return min_stops, chosen_path

# Read from popas.in
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    trails = []
    for _ in range(k):
        trails_line = list(map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split()))
        trails.append(trails_line)
    t, u = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())

min_stops, chosen_path = find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u)

# Write to popas.out
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file_out:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file_out.write('0\n')
    else:
        file_out.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_path}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly read all the input data from `popas.in`, perform the necessary calculations, and write the output to `popas.out`.

The error suggests that, when attempting to read `t` and `u` from the file, only one integer value is being read instead of two, causing the `ValueError`. The issue may be due to an off-by-one error in the previous loop that reads the trails, which I assumed had to iterate `k` times. It is possible that the last trail line (which should contain the `k`-th trail) is actually the line with `t` and `u`. I will correct this by ensuring that we read exactly `k` lines for the trails and then read `t` and `u` separately.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    chosen_path = -1

    for path in reversed(trails):
        i, r, *sources = path
        # Initialize the next required source as the first source
        next_required_source = sources[0] if sources else 0
        stops = 0 if next_required_source <= t else -1  # No stops if first source is within reach
        # Go through sources to find the number of stops
        for source in sources:
            # If the next required source is within reach, continue without a stop
            if source <= next_required_source:
                continue
            # If the source is out of reach from the last fill-up, make a stop
            if source > next_required_source + t:
                stops += 1
                next_required_source = source
        # Check if the peak can be reached from the last source
        if next_required_source + t + u < 1:
            stops += 1  # Make another stop if the peak is out of reach

        if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and i > chosen_path):
            min_stops = stops
            chosen_path = i

    return min_stops, chosen_path

# Read from popas.in
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file_in:
    k = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split())

min_stops, chosen_path = find_min_stop_path(trails, t, u)

# Write to popas.out
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_path}\n')
```

This solution ensures that `k` lines are read for the trails and then `t` and `u` are read from the next line. It should handle the input correctly and produce the right output.

The error message indicates that when trying to read the two integers `t` and `u`, the program only found one integer on the line it read, which means that the line containing `t` and `u` was not read correctly. The issue may be due to the fact that the previous loop read one line too many, mistakenly including the line with `t` and `u` as part of the trails.

To fix this, I need to ensure that the loop reading the trails reads exactly `k` lines, and then `t` and `u` are read from the subsequent line without being included in the trails. I will correct this by stopping the loop after exactly `k` trail lines, and then reading `t` and `u` from the next line.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_min_stops(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    chosen_path = 0
    for path in reversed(trails):
        path_id, r, *sources = path
        stops, reached = 0, t  # Initially, the hiker can reach up to distance t without stopping
        for source in sources:
            if source > reached:  # If the next source is beyond reach, must stop at the previous source
                reached = source + t
                stops += 1
        if reached + u < 1:  # If the peak can't be reached from the last source, one more stop is needed
            stops += 1
        # If stops are less or equal (favoring the last written path in case of a tie)
        if stops <= min_stops:
            min_stops, chosen_path = stops, path_id

    return min_stops, chosen_path

# Read input
with open('popas.in', 'r') as fin:
    k = int(fin.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, fin.readline().strip().split())

min_stops, chosen_path = calculate_min_stops(trails, t, u)

# Write output
with open('popas.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_path}\n')
```

This code should now correctly read the `k` trails and then the values for `t` and `u`, calculate the minimum number of stops and chosen path, and write the correct output to `popas.out`.
