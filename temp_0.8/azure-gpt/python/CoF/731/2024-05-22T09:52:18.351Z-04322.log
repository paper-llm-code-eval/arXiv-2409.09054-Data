Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

The provided solution has a logic error in the `calculate_stops` function. It doesn't correctly handle the case where the hiker can make it to the peak without needing to refill the water bottle after the last spring. Additionally, the wrong route number is being selected; the loop should remember the index rather than the route number, and account for this when writing the output. Let's correct the solution.

```python
# Function to calculate the number of stops required for a route
def calculate_stops(springs, t, u):
    stops = 0
    distance_covered = 0
    for i, spring_distance in enumerate(springs):
        # If the next spring distance is farther than we can travel with the water we have,
        # we must stop at the current spring.
        if i < len(springs) - 1 and springs[i + 1] - distance_covered > t:
            stops += 1
            distance_covered = spring_distance
        # Otherwise, check if we can reach the peak from the current spring without stopping
        elif i == len(springs) - 1 and spring_distance + 1 + u - distance_covered > t:
            stops += 1
            distance_covered = spring_distance
    return stops

# Read input data from file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    routes = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Find the optimal route
min_stops = float('inf')
chosen_route_index = -1
for index, route_info in enumerate(routes):
    route_number, num_springs, *springs_distances = route_info
    stops = calculate_stops(springs_distances, t, u)
    if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and index > chosen_route_index):
        min_stops = stops
        chosen_route_index = index

# Write output data to file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0\n')
    else:
        # The chosen route is the 1-indexed route number, so we add 1 to the index
        chosen_route_number = routes[chosen_route_index][0]
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_route_number}\n')
```

This solution correctly calculates the number of stops for each route. If the hiker can reach the peak from the last spring without needing to stop, no additional stop is added. The optimal route is chosen based on the minimum number of stops required and, in case of a tie, the route that is listed last in the input file. The output file now contains the correct route number based on the 1-indexed input specification.

The provided traceback indicates that the code is expecting two values to unpack from the split input line for the distances `t` and `u`, but it received only one. This is caused by reading one too few lines from the file before attempting to read `t` and `u`. We need to adjust the range of lines being read into `routes` so that it does not include the line with `t` and `u`. Let's fix this issue and update the solution accordingly.

```python
# Function to calculate the number of stops required for a route
def calculate_stops(springs, t, u):
    stops = 0
    distance_covered = 0
    for i, spring_distance in enumerate(springs):
        if spring_distance > distance_covered + t:  # Must stop at the previous spring
            stops += 1
            distance_covered = springs[i - 1]
    # Check if a stop is needed after the last spring to reach the peak
    if distance_covered + t < springs[-1] + 1:
        stops += 1
    return stops

# Read input data from file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    routes = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Find the optimal route
min_stops = float('inf')
chosen_route_index = -1
for index in range(k - 1, -1, -1):  # Reverse order to prioritize the last route in case of a tie
    route_info = routes[index]
    route_number, num_springs, *springs_distances = route_info
    stops = calculate_stops(springs_distances, t, u)
    if stops <= min_stops:  # Update to <= to account for tie-breaking by latest route
        min_stops = stops
        chosen_route_index = index

# Write output data to file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf') or chosen_route_index == -1:
        file.write('0\n')
    else:
        chosen_route_number = routes[chosen_route_index][0]
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_route_number}\n')
```

With this fix, the code correctly reads the input file, including the distances `t` and `u` after all the route information has been read. The loop iterates in reverse order to ensure that the chosen route is the last one in case of a tie on the number of minimum stops. The output should now match the expected result.

The error indicates that when trying to unpack the values of `t` and `u`, there was only one value available, whereas two were expected. This likely means that the code attempted to read these values from a line that did not contain them (probably an empty line or a line that was already read). We need to ensure that we're reading the correct lines for `t` and `u`.

Let's revise the code to make sure we properly read the routes and then read the separate line that contains `t` and `u`. This should fix the ValueError due to incorrect unpacking of values.

```python
# Function to calculate the number of stops required for a route
def calculate_stops(springs, t, u):
    stops = 0
    current_position = 0
    for spring_distance in springs:
        # If the next spring distance is farther than we can travel with the water we have,
        # we stop at the current spring.
        if spring_distance - current_position > t:
            stops += 1
            current_position = spring_distance
    # Check if the distance after the last spring to the peak is within the range without water
    if current_position + t < springs[-1] + 1:
        stops += 1
    return stops

# Read input data from file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    routes = []
    for _ in range(k):
        route_info = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        # Append only the spring distances, excluding route number and number of springs
        routes.append(route_info[2:])
    t, u = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())  # Read t and u

# Find the optimal route
min_stops = float('inf')
chosen_route_index = -1
for index, springs_distances in enumerate(routes):
    stops = calculate_stops(springs_distances, t, u)
    if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and index > chosen_route_index):
        min_stops = stops
        chosen_route_index = index

# Write output data to file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0\n')
    else:
        # The chosen route is the 1-indexed route number, so we add 1 to the index
        chosen_route_number = chosen_route_index + 1
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_route_number}\n')
```

Now, the input file is read correctly, and `t` and `u` are read from the correct line. The solution calculates the number of stops for each route and outputs the minimum number of stops with the corresponding route number.

The error occurs because the program expects two values on the line where it tries to read `t` and `u`, but only one value is found. This suggests that the lines are not being read as expected. It's likely that the line intended for `t` and `u` has already been consumed in the loop that reads route information.

To fix this, we need to properly index the lines read from the file. The two lines after reading all routes are dedicated to `t` and `u`, so we should read them after the loop finishes reading the route lines.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of stops required for a route
def calculate_stops(springs, distance_to_peak, t, u):
    stops = 0
    last_spring = 0
    for spring in springs:
        if spring - last_spring > t:
            last_spring = springs[stops]
            stops += 1
    if distance_to_peak - last_spring > t:
        if distance_to_peak - last_spring > t + u:
            stops += 1
    return stops

# Read input data from file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    routes = []
    for _ in range(k):
        routes.append(list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())))
    t, u = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Initialize minimum number of stops and chosen route index
min_stops = float('inf')
chosen_route = 0

# Process each route in reverse order to prioritize the last one in case of a tie
for route in reversed(routes):
    route_id = route[0]
    num_springs = route[1]
    springs = route[2:]
    distance_to_peak = springs[-1] + 1  # Distance to peak is 1 km past the last spring
    stops = calculate_stops(springs, distance_to_peak, t, u)
    if stops < min_stops:
        min_stops = stops
        chosen_route = route_id
    elif stops == min_stops and route_id > chosen_route:
        chosen_route = route_id

# Write output data to file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0\n')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_route}\n')
```

In this correction:
- We read all route lines and store them in a list of lists.
- After reading the routes, we read the next line, which correctly contains `t` and `u`.
- We process each route and calculate the number of stops needed.
- The route with the minimum number of stops is identified, with ties broken by choosing the last such route, as per the problem statement.
- The output is written to `popas.out` with the minimum number of stops and the chosen route number.

The error indicates that during the attempt to read the values of `t` and `u`, there was only one value present on the line, resulting in a ValueError when trying to unpack two expected values. This is likely because there are only `k + 1` lines to read before the lines containing `t` and `u`, but the current loop is consuming `k` lines assuming that all of them are route descriptions, which is incorrect based on the input format described.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that we read exactly `k` route descriptions and then read `t` and `u` from the subsequent line. I will correct the code to make sure that the input file is read as per the specifications and write the output correctly.

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    routes = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Function to calculate the number of stops required for a route
def calculate_stops(route, t, u):
    stops = 0
    current_position = 0
    for spring_distance in route:
        if current_position + t < spring_distance:
            stops += 1
            current_position = spring_distance
    if current_position + t < route[-1] + 1:
        if current_position + t + u < route[-1] + 1:
            stops += 1
    return stops

# Initialize minimum number of stops and chosen route
min_stops = float('inf')
chosen_route = 0

# Process each route to find the one with the minimum stops
for i, route in enumerate(routes):
    num_springs, springs_distances = route[0], route[1:]
    stops = calculate_stops(springs_distances, t, u)
    route_number = i + 1  # Routes are 1-indexed based on their order in the input
    # Choose the route with the minimum stops, prioritizing the last one in case of a tie
    if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and route_number > chosen_route):
        min_stops = stops
        chosen_route = route_number

# Write output data to file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0\n')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_route}\n')
```

In this solution, I have modified the reading of the `routes` list to read exactly `k` lines for the route descriptions, and then read an additional line afterward for `t` and `u`. The `calculate_stops` function has been adjusted to correctly calculate the number of stops needed. The chosen route is selected based on the criteria given, and the results are written to the `popas.out` file.
