Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

# Read the data from the input file

def calculate_stops(trail, t, u):
    stops, max_reach = 0, t
    for spring in trail:
        if spring > max_reach:
            if spring - max_reach > u:
                return float('inf')
            stops += 1
            max_reach = spring + t
    return stops if max_reach >= trail[-1] + 1 else float('inf')

# Find the best trail with the minimum number of stops
best_stops = float('inf')
best_trail = -1
for i, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    if stops <= best_stops:
        best_stops = stops
        best_trail = i

# Write the results to the output file

    if best_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0')
    else:
        file.write(f'{best_stops} {best_trail}')
```

This Python code reads the input from the 'popas.in' file, processes the data to find the trail with the minimum number of stops needed for a hiker to reach the peak without running out of water, and writes the output to the 'popas.out' file. The solution uses a function `calculate_stops` to calculate the number of stops for each trail and determines the best trail accordingly. If no solution is found, the output file contains the digit `0`.

Apologies for the confusion. After re-evaluating the problem, I realized the mistake in my previous solution – I did not properly handle the case when the hiker has enough water to reach the summit without stopping after the last spring, and the case where the last spring is exactly at a distance 't' from the summit. Let's rectify these issues and rewrite the code accordingly:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of stops needed for a given trail
def calculate_stops(trail, t, u):
    stops, max_reach = 0, t
    for spring in trail:
        if spring > max_reach:
            if spring - max_reach > u:
                return float('inf')
            stops += 1
            max_reach = spring + t
    if trail[-1] + 1 > max_reach:
        if trail[-1] + 1 - max_reach > u:
            return float('inf')
        stops += 1
    return stops

# Read the data from the input file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    k = int(lines[0].strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, line.strip().split()))[1:] for line in lines[1:k+1]]
    t, u = map(int, lines[-2:])

# Find the best trail with the minimum number of stops
best_stops = float('inf')
best_trail = -1
for i, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    if stops < best_stops or (stops == best_stops and i > best_trail):
        best_stops = stops
        best_trail = i

# Write the results to the output file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if best_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0')
    else:
        file.write(f'{best_stops} {best_trail}')
```

In this code, we first fix the `calculate_stops` function to correctly handle the case where the hiker can reach the summit without stopping after the last spring. We also ensure that the last spring is considered in the case where it is the only place where the hiker can refill before reaching the summit. Afterward, we read the input data and use the fixed function to determine the best trail. Finally, we write the corrected result to 'popas.out'.

This revised solution should now correctly output `1 1` for the given example input.

My previous solution did not correctly handle the output for the given input data. Let's re-evaluate the problem and fix the algorithm. 

The key issue in the last solution was that it didn't handle the distances correctly, and it also failed to account for the fact that the hiker's water capacity could extend beyond the last spring. The hiker only needs to refill at a spring if the next spring (or the summit) is further than 't' kilometers away from their current position. If the last spring is within 't' kilometers from the summit, they don't need to stop there.

Let's revise the 'calculate_stops' function and the overall logic to correctly calculate the minimum number of stops needed:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of stops needed for a given trail
def calculate_stops(trail, t, u):
    current_position = 0
    stops = 0
    for spring in trail:
        # If the next spring is too far, refill at the current spring
        if current_position + t < spring:
            return float('inf')  # Can't reach the next spring or summit
        if stops == 0 or spring - trail[stops - 1] > t:
            stops += 1
            current_position = spring
    # Check if we need an additional stop to reach the summit
    if current_position + t < trail[-1] + 1:
        if trail[-1] + 1 - current_position > u:
            return float('inf')  # Can't reach the summit without water
        stops += 1
    return stops

# Read the data from the input file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, file.readlines()[-2:])

# Find the best trail with the minimum number of stops
best_stops = float('inf')
best_trail = -1
for i, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    if stops < best_stops or (stops == best_stops and i > best_trail):
        best_stops = stops
        best_trail = i

# Write the results to the output file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if best_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0')
    else:
        file.write(f'{best_stops} {best_trail}')
```

In this corrected solution, we track the current position of the hiker after each refill. If the distance to the next spring or summit exceeds the hiker's remaining water capacity, we refill at the current spring. We then write the best trail number with the minimum number of stops to `popas.out`. This solution accounts for the correct handling of distances and refills, so it should now provide the expected output for the given input data.

Upon reevaluation, the key issue seems to be with the logic of calculating the number of stops correctly. Let's re-implement the solution using a clearer and more correct approach to the problem.

The hiker needs to refill at the spring if and only if the next spring (or the summit, which is always 1 kilometer past the last spring) is too far away, meaning that it's further than 't' kilometers from the current position.

We need to correct our implementation by properly tracking the distance the hiker can travel with water from the last spring, and by making sure we correctly count stops when the next spring or the summit is within reach.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def calculate_stops(trail, t, u):
    stops = 0
    max_distance_with_water = 0
    for spring in trail:
        if max_distance_with_water < spring:
            stops += 1
            max_distance_with_water = spring + t
    # Check if the hiker can reach the summit from the last spring without stopping
    if max_distance_with_water < trail[-1] + 1:
        # If the distance from the last spring to the summit is greater than `u`, the hiker can't make it
        if trail[-1] + 1 - max_distance_with_water > u:
            return float('inf')
        stops += 1  # One final refill needed at the last spring
    return stops

# Read the input data
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()[2:])) for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Find the trail with the minimum number of stops
min_stops = float('inf')
min_trail_number = 0
for trail_number, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    num_stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    # If two trails have the same number of stops, prefer the one with the larger number (later in the file)
    if num_stops < min_stops or (num_stops == min_stops and trail_number > min_trail_number):
        min_stops = num_stops
        min_trail_number = trail_number

# Write the output data
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {min_trail_number}')
```

This corrected solution tracks the maximum distance the hiker can travel with water after refilling at each spring. If the hiker can't reach the next spring or the summit, they must refill. If they can reach the summit from the last spring, they only refill if the summit is farther away than 'u' kilometers from the current position with water. The solution then writes the trail with the minimum number of necessary stops to the `popas.out` file. This should satisfy the expected output for the given input data.

The error occurs because the reading of `t` and `u` parameters in the code is incorrect. Instead of reading the last two lines separately, the code is attempting to read them together as one line. Since the last two lines contain one number each, we should read them separately.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def calculate_stops(trail, t, u):
    stops = 0
    reach = t
    for spring in trail:
        # If the next spring is within reach, no need to stop
        if spring <= reach:
            continue
        # If the next spring is too far, stop at the last spring
        else:
            stops += 1
            reach = spring + t  # Update reach after refilling
    # Check if we need an additional stop to reach the summit
    if reach < trail[-1] + 1:
        # If we can reach the summit with the remaining water, no need to stop
        if trail[-1] + 1 - reach <= u:
            return stops
        # If we can't reach the summit with the remaining water, this trail is not possible
        else:
            return float('inf')
    return stops

# Read the input data
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()[2:])) for _ in range(k)]
    t = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read the distance the hiker's water lasts
    u = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read the distance the hiker can go without water

# Find the trail with the minimum number of stops
min_stops = float('inf')
min_trail_number = 0
for trail_number, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    num_stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    # If two trails have the same number of stops, prefer the one with the larger number (later in the file)
    if num_stops < min_stops or (num_stops == min_stops and trail_number > min_trail_number):
        min_stops = num_stops
        min_trail_number = trail_number

# Write the output data
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {min_trail_number}')
```

This solution should now read the `t` and `u` values correctly from the input file and then proceed to calculate the number of stops for each trail. It will output the number of stops and the trail number with the minimum number of stops to `popas.out`. If no solution is possible, it will output `0`.

The issue with the current solution lies in incorrectly calculating the number of stops and not considering the proper condition that we should choose the trail that is written last in the input file (in case of ties in the number of stops). We need to make sure to choose the trail with the minimum number of stops, and if there are multiple trails with the same number of stops, choose the one that appears last in the input file.

Let's fix the calculation of stops and ensure we choose the correct trail based on the above condition:

```python
def calculate_stops(trail, t, u):
    stops = 0
    reach = 0  # The maximum distance that can be reached with the current water
    for spring in trail:
        if spring > reach:
            # If the spring is farther than the reach, the hiker has to stop
            stops += 1
            reach = spring + t  # Update the reach after refilling
    # Check if the hiker can reach the summit from the last spring without stopping
    if trail[-1] + 1 > reach:  # The summit is 1km beyond the last spring
        # If the summit is out of reach, check if the hiker can go without water
        if trail[-1] + 1 - reach > u:
            return float('inf')  # The trail is not possible if the hiker can't make it to the summit
        stops += 1  # Additional stop needed at the last spring
    return stops

# Read the input data
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()[2:])) for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Find the trail with the minimum number of stops
min_stops = float('inf')
chosen_trail = -1
for trail_number, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    num_stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    # If we find a better trail or if there's a tie, choose the latter one (since it appears last in the file)
    if num_stops < min_stops or (num_stops == min_stops and trail_number > chosen_trail):
        min_stops = num_stops
        chosen_trail = trail_number

# Write the output data
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_trail}')
```

This solution should now handle the tie-breaking condition correctly by choosing the trail which appears last in the file if there are multiple trails with the same minimum number of stops. It also fixes the calculation of stops by ensuring that a stop is only made if the spring is beyond the current reach. With these adjustments, the solution should match the expected output of `1 1` for the given input data.

The error is caused by trying to read two integer values (`t` and `u`) from the same line, but according to the input data format, `t` and `u` are provided on separate lines at the end of the file. We should read them on separate lines rather than attempting to read them both from a single line.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_stops(trail, t, u):
    stops = 0
    reach = t  # The maximum distance that can be reached with the current water
    for i, spring in enumerate(trail):
        if spring > reach:
            # If the spring is farther than the reach, the hiker has to stop
            stops += 1
            reach = spring + t  # Update the reach after refilling
    # If the last spring is within reach, don't need to stop, just check if the hiker can reach the summit
    if reach < trail[-1] + 1:
        if reach + u < trail[-1] + 1:
            # Cannot reach the summit without another refill
            return float('inf')
        # Can reach the summit without another refill, no additional stop needed
    return stops

# Read the input data
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()[2:])) for _ in range(k)]
    t = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read the distance the hiker's water lasts
    u = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read the distance the hiker can go without water

# Find the trail with the minimum number of stops
min_stops = float('inf')
chosen_trail = -1
for trail_number, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    num_stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    # If we find a better trail or if there's a tie, choose the latter one (since it appears last in the file)
    if num_stops < min_stops or (num_stops == min_stops and trail_number > chosen_trail):
        min_stops = num_stops
        chosen_trail = trail_number

# Write the output data
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        file.write('0')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_stops} {chosen_trail}')
```

This solution is now correctly reading the distance `t` for which the hiker's water lasts and the distance `u` the hiker can go without water from two separate lines. With this fix, the solution should not exit with code 1 and should correctly output the expected result of `1 1` for the given input data.
