Se dă un număr $N$, și un șir de $N$ numere naturale nenule.

# Cerință
1. Determinați suma valorilor aflate pe ultimele $K$ poziții în șir (unde $K$ reprezintă valoarea celei mai din dreapta cifre nenule a primei valori din șir).
2. Ne imaginăm împărțirea șirului în secvențe în următorul mod: prima secvență este formată din primele $L$ elemente, a doua este formată din următoarele $L - 1$ elemente, a treia este formată din următoarele $L - 2$ elemente și așa mai departe, ultima secvență este formată dintr-un singur element și acesta **coincide cu ultimul element din șir**. Considerând suma valorilor fiecărei secvențe, să se determine cea mai mare dintre aceste sume.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului `sss.in` se află două valori $C$ și $N$ separate printr-un spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu. Pentru $C = 1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$ iar pentru $C = 2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `sss.out` conține un singur număr care reprezintă valoarea calculată conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Valorile din șir sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 100 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că pentru testele în care $C = 1$ șirul are cel puțin $K$ elemente;
* Se garantează că valoarea lui N permite descompunerea conform descrierii, pentru testele care au $C = 2$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $51$ de puncte avem $C = 1$;
* Pentru $27$ de puncte dintre testele în care $C = 1$, primul număr din șir are o cifră;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $49$ de puncte avem $C = 2$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $22$ de puncte dintre cele care au $C = 2$, valoarea lui $N$ este mai mică sau egală cu $10$.
* Denumirea problemei este o prescurtare de la “sume și secvențe”.

This Python program reads input from the file `sss.in`, processes it according to the challenge requirements, and writes the result to `sss.out`. The `solve_task_1` function calculates the sum of the last K elements given the rightmost non-zero digit K of the first number. The `solve_task_2` function splits the sequence into subsequences of decreasing length and finds the maximum sum. The main function determines which task to execute based on the first number in the input.

My previous solution for task 2 had a logical error: the loop was supposed to calculate the sum of each subsequence starting from the first element and decreasing the length of the subsequence by 1 each time, but instead, it failed to accumulate the sums correctly. This caused the incorrect output.

Let's fix the logic for task 2 and rewrite the solution:

```python
def task_1(numbers, k):
    return sum(numbers[-k:])

def task_2(numbers):
    max_sum = 0
    subsequence_sum = 0
    for start in range(len(numbers)):
        subsequence_sum += numbers[start]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, subsequence_sum)
        if start >= len(numbers) - max_sum:  # Optimization to stop if max sum can't be exceeded
            break
        subsequence_sum -= numbers[start - (len(numbers) - start) + 1] if start >= (len(numbers) - start) else 0
    return max_sum

def main():
    with open('sss.in', 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    result = 0
    if c == 1:
        k = int(str(numbers[0]).strip('0')[-1])
        result = task_1(numbers, k)
    elif c == 2:
        result = task_2(numbers)

    with open('sss.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Explanation of the changes:
- For task 2, we iterate through the numbers starting from the first element. With each iteration, we add the current number to `subsequence_sum` and check if it's larger than `max_sum`. We then subtract the element that falls off the subsequence as we move forward, ensuring that we are always considering a subsequence that ends with the element `numbers[start]`.
- The added optimization checks if it's possible for the remaining numbers to exceed the current `max_sum`. If not, the loop breaks early.
- The `task_2` function no longer requires `n` as a parameter since it can be derived from the length of the `numbers` list.

This corrected version should yield the expected result for task 2. Task 1 remains unchanged because it was correctly implemented in the previous solution.

It appears there was a misunderstanding in the algorithm for task 2. The previous solutions did not correctly implement the logic to form the subsequences as specified in the problem statement. A correct implementation for task 2 should start with the full sequence and then remove one element from the beginning of the remaining sequence to form the next subsequence, and so on.

Let's rewrite the solution for task 2, taking into account the correct interpretation of forming the subsequences:

```python
def get_last_non_zero_digit(number):
    return int(str(number).rstrip('0')[-1])

def task_1(numbers, k):
    return sum(numbers[-k:])

def task_2(numbers):
    max_sum = 0
    current_length = len(numbers)
    start_index = 0
    while current_length > 0:
        current_sum = sum(numbers[start_index:start_index + current_length])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        current_length -= 1
        start_index += 1
    return max_sum

def main():
    with open('sss.in', 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    result = 0
    if c == 1:
        k = get_last_non_zero_digit(numbers[0])
        result = task_1(numbers, k)
    elif c == 2:
        result = task_2(numbers)

    with open('sss.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this corrected solution for task 2, we start with the whole list as the first subsequence, get its sum, and check if it's the largest sum we've seen so far. We then shorten the subsequence by 1 from the beginning (not from the end), and repeat the process until the subsequence's length is 1.

This implementation should correctly handle the provided sample input and output the expected result.

The issue with the previous implementation for task 2 was that it did not correctly form the subsequences according to the problem statement. Instead of removing one element from the beginning of the remaining sequence, we must consider that each subsequent subsequence is one element shorter than the previous one, starting from the first element of the sequence, and not by shifting the start index.

Let's correct the implementation according to this logic:

```python
def task_1(numbers, k):
    return sum(numbers[-k:])

def task_2(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    max_sum = 0
    for L in range(n, 0, -1):  # L goes from n to 1
        current_sum = sum(numbers[n-L:n-L+L])  # Sum of the current subsequence
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def main():
    with open('sss.in', 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    if c == 1:
        k = int(str(numbers[0]).rstrip('0')[-1])
        result = task_1(numbers, k)
    else:
        result = task_2(numbers)

    with open('sss.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this corrected implementation for task 2, the `task_2` function iterates over the sequence, reducing the length of the subsequence by 1 each time, and calculating the sum of these subsequences from the end of the list backward. It finds the maximum sum across all these subsequences, which should match the expected output.

This should now produce the correct output for the given input.

The previous solution for task 2 has a flawed implementation because it does not correctly form subsequences according to the problem statement. We need to create subsequences of decreasing length by one with each step, starting with the full length of the given array and reducing until we are left with just one element.

Let's implement the correct algorithm for task 2:

```python
def task_1(numbers, k):
    return sum(numbers[-k:])

def task_2(numbers):
    max_sum = current_sum = 0
    subsequence_length = len(numbers)
    
    for i in range(subsequence_length):
        current_sum += numbers[i]  # Add the next number in the sequence
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)  # Update max_sum if needed
        if i >= subsequence_length - 1:  # When we reach the last element of the subsequence
            current_sum -= numbers[subsequence_length - i - 1]  # Subtract the first element of the current subsequence
            subsequence_length -= 1  # Reduce the length of the next subsequence

    return max_sum

def main():
    with open('sss.in', 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    result = 0
    if c == 1:
        first_num = numbers[0]
        k = int(str(first_num).rstrip('0')[-1])
        result = task_1(numbers, k)
    elif c == 2:
        result = task_2(numbers)

    with open('sss.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this implementation, task 2 iterates through the numbers, summing them up as it goes. Once it has reached the end of the current subsequence, it subtracts the number at the start of the subsequence and reduces the length of the next subsequence by 1. This way, each subsequence is one shorter than the previous subsequence, with the last subsequence being just one element.

This corrected solution should now provide the expected result for task 2 when given the input data provided.

I apologize for the confusion caused by previous attempts. The mistake in the task 2 implementation lies in the logic for forming the subsequences. We need to start with the longest subsequence (which includes all elements) and then repeatedly create shorter subsequences by removing one element from the start of the previous subsequence, not from the end.

Let's correct the implementation for task 2:

```python
def task_1(numbers, k):
    return sum(numbers[-k:])

def task_2(numbers):
    max_sum = 0
    for L in range(len(numbers), 0, -1):  # Start with the full sequence and reduce the subsequence length
        current_sum = sum(numbers[len(numbers) - L:])  # Sum from the end, keeping the length of L
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def main():
    with open('sss.in', 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    if c == 1:
        k = int(str(numbers[0]).rstrip('0')[-1])
        result = task_1(numbers, k)
    else:
        result = task_2(numbers)

    with open('sss.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this corrected solution, for task 2, we start with the entire sequence and then form shorter subsequences by maintaining the end of the sequence constant and removing elements from the start. We calculate the sum for each subsequence and keep track of the maximum sum found.

This corrected solution should produce the expected output of 11 for the given input data.
