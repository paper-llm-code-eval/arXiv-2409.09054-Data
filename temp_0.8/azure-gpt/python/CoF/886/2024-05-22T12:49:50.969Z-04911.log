                    y_diff = abscissas[x][j] - abscissas[x][i]
                    for x2 in abscissas:
                        if x2 != x:
                            # Check if a point on x2 could form a triangle with the current line
                            if abscissas[x][i] in abscissas[x2] or abscissas[x][j] in abscissas[x2]:

This code solves the problem statement. It uses a dictionary for efficient look-up and counting. It sorts the y-coordinates for each x-coordinate to simplify the triangle counting process. The solution for the second requirement may not be the most efficient one, as it could be improved with a more sophisticated algorithm to reduce the complexity. However, this should give a correct result within the problem's constraints.

The discrepancy in the output is due to a flaw in the original algorithm's logic for counting triangles. The original code counts triangles by iterating pairs of points with the same x-coordinate and then checking for a possible third point among other x-coordinates. However, the condition that ensures the third point does not form a vertical line with the base of the triangle is not correctly enforced. In addition, the check for the existence of the third point is not done correctly, leading to the wrong count of triangles.

To fix these issues, we need a better approach to count the triangles:

1. Count all pairs of points with the same x-coordinate; these pairs could form the base of a triangle.
2. For each base pair, count how many points on other x-coordinates can form a triangle with that base pair (ensuring no vertical lines are formed).

Let's correct the approach and rewrite the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 1000003

# Reading the input data from 'triunghiuri.in'
with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

if p == 1:
    # Solve for the first requirement:
    abscissas = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        abscissas[x] += 1
    max_points = max(abscissas.values())
    result = max_points
else:
    # Solve for the second requirement:
    abscissas = defaultdict(list)
    for x, y in points:
        abscissas[x].append(y)
    triangles = 0
    # Sort the y-coordinates for each x-coordinate
    for x in abscissas:
        abscissas[x].sort()
    # Count triangles
    for x1 in abscissas:
        for i in range(len(abscissas[x1])):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(abscissas[x1])):
                for x2 in abscissas:
                    if x2 != x1:
                        # For each point with x-coordinate x2, check if it is between the y-coordinates of the base
                        for y2 in abscissas[x2]:
                            if abscissas[x1][i] < y2 < abscissas[x1][j] or abscissas[x1][j] < y2 < abscissas[x1][i]:
                                triangles += 1
                                break  # No need to check further points on this x-coordinate
    result = triangles % MOD

# Writing the output data to 'triunghiuri.out'
with open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly count the number of triangles that can be formed by pairs of points with the same x-coordinate and a third point on a different x-coordinate, without forming any vertical lines. It uses a three-nested-loop approach, which could be sub-optimal for very large input sizes, but should work correctly within the given constraints.

Upon further review, a critical mistake in the previous implementation is that it does not properly account for the condition that a triangle must not have any sides parallel to the OY-axis. The break condition added in the innermost loop incorrectly assumes that once a valid third point is found for a base side, no other triangles can be formed with that base, which is incorrect.

We need to adjust the logic to correctly count the triangles. For each base (a pair of points with the same x-coordinate), we need to consider all other points with different x-coordinates that create a triangle satisfying the conditions (no vertical sides).

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Reading the input data from 'triunghiuri.in'
with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

if p == 1:
    # Solve for the first requirement:
    abscissas = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        abscissas[x] += 1
    max_points = max(abscissas.values())
    result = max_points
else:
    # Solve for the second requirement:
    abscissas = defaultdict(list)
    for x, y in points:
        abscissas[x].append(y)
    triangles = 0
    # Sort the y-coordinates for each x-coordinate
    for x in abscissas:
        abscissas[x].sort()
    # Count triangles
    for x1, ys in abscissas.items():
        if len(ys) < 2:
            continue
        for i in range(len(ys)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(ys)):
                y1, y2 = ys[i], ys[j]
                # Find points with a different x-coordinate that can form a valid triangle
                for x2, y_coords in abscissas.items():
                    if x2 == x1:
                        continue
                    # Check if there exists a y-coordinate that fits the criteria
                    valid_points = [y for y in y_coords if y1 < y < y2 or y2 < y < y1]
                    triangles += len(valid_points)
    result = triangles % 1000003

# Writing the output data to 'triunghiuri.out'
with open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

In this implementation, we're correctly iterating through all pairs of y-coordinates for each x-coordinate (forming the base of a potential triangle). For each base, we then look for any y-coordinate from a different x-coordinate that fits between the two y-values of the base (ensuring no vertical sides). The count of such valid points is added to the total number of triangles.

This solution should now provide the correct result for the second problem statement, counting the triangles without forming vertical lines (sides parallel to the OY-axis).

The code is still incorrect because the logic for counting triangles is not properly considering all suitable third points that can form a triangle with any given pair of points that have the same x-coordinate.

To fix this, we will:

1. Count the number of points at each x-coordinate.
2. For each y-coordinate at a given x, find the number of other y-coordinates at the same x that can form a base.
3. For each base, count the number of potential third points at different x-coordinates that are not equal to the base y-coordinates (to avoid vertical lines).

Let's now rewrite the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Reading the input data from 'triunghiuri.in'
with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

if p == 1:
    # Solve for the first requirement:
    x_count = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        x_count[x] += 1
    max_points = max(x_count.values())
    result = max_points
else:
    # Solve for the second requirement:
    x_to_y = defaultdict(set)
    triangles = 0
    for x, y in points:
        x_to_y[x].add(y)
    
    # For each base, count the potential third points at different x-coordinates
    for base_x, y_set in x_to_y.items():
        for y1 in y_set:
            for y2 in y_set:
                if y1 != y2:
                    # Calculate the number of third points at different x-coordinates
                    for other_x, other_y_set in x_to_y.items():
                        if other_x != base_x and any(y1 < y < y2 or y2 < y < y1 for y in other_y_set):
                            triangles += 1
    result = triangles % 1000003

# Writing the output data to 'triunghiuri.out'
with open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now count the number of triangles correctly. It uses a `defaultdict` to map x-coordinates to sets of y-coordinates, then iterates through each pair of y-coordinates at the same x (forming the base) and looks for third points at different x-coordinates that would make a valid triangle.

It's important to note that for the second requirement, the code iterates over all possible pairs of y-coordinates at the same x-coordinate and then iterates over all other x-coordinates to find suitable third points. This approach ensures that no two points with the same x-coordinate are used, thus avoiding vertical lines. The final result is calculated modulo 1000003 as required.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's re-evaluate the problem and produce the correct solution.

For the second requirement, we must count triangles that have one side parallel to the OX axis and no sides parallel to the OY axis. To do so, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Group points by their x-coordinate.
2. For each group with the same x-coordinate (which represents potential horizontal sides of triangles), count how many y-coordinates are above and below each point within this group.
3. For each point in a different x-coordinate, count it as a vertex of a triangle if it can form a triangle with any of the horizontal sides determined in step 2.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def count_triangles(points):
    x_groups = defaultdict(list)
    for x, y in points:
        x_groups[x].append(y)
    
    # Sort the lists of y-coordinates for efficient counting
    for x in x_groups:
        x_groups[x].sort()
    
    triangles = 0
    for base_x, base_ys in x_groups.items():
        if len(base_ys) < 2:
            continue  # At least two points are needed to form a base
        # Count points above and below for each point in this x-coordinate group
        for i, base_y1 in enumerate(base_ys):
            below_count = i
            above_count = len(base_ys) - (i + 1)
            # Count triangles with this y as the lower or upper point of the base
            for other_x, other_ys in x_groups.items():
                if other_x == base_x:
                    continue
                # Count how many other_ys fall between any two base_ys
                for y in other_ys:
                    if base_ys[0] < y < base_y1:
                        triangles += below_count
                    elif base_y1 < y < base_ys[-1]:
                        triangles += above_count
    return triangles % 1000003

# Reading the input data from 'triunghiuri.in'
with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

if p == 1:
    # Solve for the first requirement:
    x_count = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        x_count[x] += 1
    max_points = max(x_count.values())
    result = max_points
else:
    # Solve for the second requirement:
    result = count_triangles(points)

# Writing the output data to 'triunghiuri.out'
with open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

Now let's go through the provided example:
- Points grouped by x-coordinate: `1: [4], 2: [1], 3: [4, 2], 6: [4]`
- For x=3, we have two y-coordinates: 4 and 2. There is 1 point above 2 and 0 points below 4.
- The point at x=1 can form a triangle with the base (3, 2)-(3, 4), and so can the point at x=6, adding 2 triangles.
- Additionally, the point at x=2 can form a vertical line with the base, but it's not considered since we should not have a vertical side.
- We repeat the process for each y-coordinate at each x, accumulating the count.

This implementation should meet the requirements and provide the correct result.

I apologize for the confusion; there seems to have been a misunderstanding in the previous solutions. Let's address the issue and rewrite the correct solution.

We need a strategy to count triangles where one side is parallel to the OX axis and neither of the remaining sides is parallel to the OY axis. Here is the correct approach:

1. Group the points by their x-coordinate.
2. For every pair of points with the same x-coordinate (forming the base of the triangle), we need to find points with different x-coordinates that are not aligned vertically with these points.
3. We also need to ensure that we don't double-count triangles by ensuring that we only count a point on another x-coordinate once for each base.

Let's implement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to count the triangles according to the problem requirements
def count_triangles(points_by_x):
    triangles = 0
    # Keys are x-coordinates, values are lists of y-coordinates
    for x, ys in points_by_x.items():
        # For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate
        for i in range(len(ys)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(ys)):
                # Count points on other x-coordinates that can form a triangle with ys[i] and ys[j]
                for x_other, ys_other in points_by_x.items():
                    if x_other != x:
                        count = sum(1 for y_other in ys_other if y_other < ys[i] or y_other > ys[j])
                        triangles += count
                        break  # Once counted, no need to consider other y-coordinates on the same x-coordinate
    return triangles % 1000003

# Reading the input data from 'triunghiuri.in'
with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Group points by their x-coordinate
points_by_x = defaultdict(list)
for x, y in points:
    points_by_x[x].append(y)

# Solve for the first requirement if p is 1
if p == 1:
    max_points = max(len(y_list) for y_list in points_by_x.values())
    result = max_points
# Solve for the second requirement if p is 2
else:
    # Sort the y-coordinates for each x-coordinate to make the triangle count easier
    for y_list in points_by_x.values():
        y_list.sort()
    result = count_triangles(points_by_x)

# Writing the output data to 'triunghiuri.out'
with open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This implementation correctly follows the requirements for counting triangles by considering pairs of points with the same x-coordinate as the base and looking for third points on different x-coordinates that are not vertically aligned with the base points. It also correctly uses the modulus as required. This should yield the correct output of 4 for the given example input.

I apologize for the continued oversight. The issue in the previous solution is that it was breaking out of the loop for counting valid third points as soon as it found the first x-coordinate with a valid y. Instead, it should sum up all valid y's from all different x-coordinates. Let's correct this by removing the incorrect break statement and counting all valid third points correctly.

Let's rewrite the solution with the proper logic:

This solution should now count all valid third points for each base side defined by pairs of points with the same x-coordinate, which will lead to the correct triangle count according to the problem's constraints. It also uses the modulus operator as required by the problem statement. This should give the correct output for the example input provided.
