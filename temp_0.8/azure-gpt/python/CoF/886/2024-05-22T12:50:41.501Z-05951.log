Note that this code should be saved in a `.py` file, and it expects the `triunghiuri.in` file to be present in the same directory. After running the script, it will generate the `triunghiuri.out` file with the expected output. The solution follows the steps that I earlier mentioned and optimizes for speed, especially in the case of finding the number of triangles in problem 2 since it reduces the problem to counting the combinations of points with the same x (after sorting them, which is necessary to avoid counting lines parallel to the Y-axis) and then multiplying by the number of different x values minus one (to ensure we do not count lines parallel to the X-axis). The modulo operation is performed to avoid large number issues and adhere to the problem statement.

The found output does not match the expected output because my initial solution did not correctly assess the number of triangles that can be formed. The condition was that there should be no lines parallel to the OY axis, which was misunderstood. I incorrectly calculated the number of triangles by simply multiplying the number of points with the same x coordinate with the number of unique x coordinates minus one.

The correct approach to solve problem 2 is to count the number of triangles that can be formed by using each pair of points with the same x coordinate as the base of the triangle and then finding a third point with a different x coordinate to form the triangle.

Let's correct the algorithm for problem 2:

1. For each x value, find all unique pairs of y values (each pair can form the base of a triangle).
2. For each base, count all points with different x values (each one forms a triangle with the base).
3. Sum up all these counts to get the total number of triangles.

Let's apply this correction to the code:

```python
# Solution to the problem

MOD = 1000003

def read_input():
    with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return p, N, points

def solve_problem1(points):
    x_counts = {}
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] = x_counts.get(x, 0) + 1
    return max(x_counts.values())

def solve_problem2(points):
    # Prepare a map of the x coordinates to their y coordinates
    x_map = {}
    for x, y in points:
        if x not in x_map:
            x_map[x] = []
        x_map[x].append(y)
    
    triangle_count = 0
    for x, y_list in x_map.items():
        y_pairs = len(y_list) * (len(y_list) - 1) // 2
        triangle_count += y_pairs * (len(x_map) - 1)
        triangle_count %= MOD
    return triangle_count

def write_output(answer):
    with open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f'{answer}\n')

def main():
    p, N, points = read_input()
    if p == 1:
        answer = solve_problem1(points)
    else:
        answer = solve_problem2(points)
    write_output(answer)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code should yield the correct result for both problem 1 and problem 2. The key change is in the `solve_problem2` function, where it now correctly calculates the number of unique base pairs from the same x-coordinate points and multiplies that by the count of other x-coordinates to find the number of triangles. This solution ensures that there are no lines parallel to the OY axis.

Given the incorrect results, it seems my previous solution for problem 2 still contains a mistake. The issue lies in the counting of triangles. Instead of multiplying the number of y pairs by the count of other x-coordinates, I should be summing the number of y pairs for each x-coordinate and multiplying this number by the number of points with different x-coordinates.

The logic should be as follows:
1. For each x-coordinate, calculate the number of ways to choose two points (which will form the base of the triangle).
2. For each base (pair of points with the same x-coordinate), there can be as many triangles as there are points with a different x-coordinate.

Let's correct the code for problem 2:

```python
# Solution to the problem

MOD = 1000003

def read_input():
    with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return p, N, points

def solve_problem1(points):
    x_counts = {}
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] = x_counts.get(x, 0) + 1
    return max(x_counts.values())

def solve_problem2(points):
    from collections import defaultdict
    x_counts = defaultdict(int)
    y_counts = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
    
    # Count the number of points with each x-coordinate and
    # the number of points with each y-coordinate per x-coordinate.
    for x, y in points:
        x_counts[x] += 1
        y_counts[x][y] += 1
    
    triangle_count = 0
    # For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate, count triangles.
    for x, y_dict in y_counts.items():
        # Only consider x-coordinates with more than one point.
        if x_counts[x] > 1:
            # For each y-coordinate, calculate the contribution to the triangle count.
            for y, count in y_dict.items():
                # Exclude the current y-coordinate count from the x-coordinate count.
                triangles_with_base_at_x = (x_counts[x] - count) * count
                # Multiply by the number of points with different x-coordinates.
                triangle_count += triangles_with_base_at_x * (len(x_counts) - 1)
                triangle_count %= MOD
    
    return triangle_count

def write_output(answer):
    with open('triunghiuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f'{answer}\n')

def main():
    p, N, points = read_input()
    if p == 1:
        answer = solve_problem1(points)
    else:
        answer = solve_problem2(points)
    write_output(answer)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This updated solution should now correctly calculate the number of valid triangles as described in the task, taking into account that the triangles must have one base parallel to the OX axis and no side parallel to the OY axis. It uses extra space to keep track of count of y-coordinates per x-coordinate, and then it calculates the number of potential triangles for each x-coordinate. It makes sure to subtract the count of the current y-coordinate when calculating the number of triangles that can be formed with a base at the current x-coordinate. This should give us the correct output for the given problem.

It seems that the previous solution still provides the incorrect result. The issue lies in the triangle counting logic, which isn't considering the uniqueness of the triangles properly. The correct approach should ensure that each triangle has a base parallel to the OX axis and no other sides parallel to either axis.

To correct this, let's clarify the conditions:

- For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate (forming a potential base of a triangle), we need to find a third point with a different x-coordinate to complete the triangle.
- However, we should only count the third points that have y-coordinates either strictly above or strictly below both y-coordinates of the base to ensure no side is parallel to the OY axis.

Let's implement this correction:

```python
# Solution to the problem

MOD = 1000003

def read_input():
    with open('triunghiuri.in', 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())

    return p, N, points

def solve_problem1(points):
    x_counts = {}
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] = x_counts.get(x, 0) + 1
    return max(x_counts.values())

def solve_problem2(points):
    from collections import defaultdict
    x_to_ys = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Collect all y-coordinates for each x-coordinate.
    for x, y in points:
        x_to_ys[x].append(y)
    
    triangle_count = 0
    # Sort the y-coordinates for each x-coordinate.
    for x in x_to_ys:
        x_to_ys[x].sort()

    # Count triangles.
    for x1, y_list in x_to_ys.items():
        for i in range(len(y_list) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(y_list)):
                y_low, y_high = y_list[i], y_list[j]
                # Count points with different x-coordinates that
                # have y-coordinates not between y_low and y_high.
                for x2, other_y_list in x_to_ys.items():
                    if x2 != x1:
                        triangle_count += sum(1 for y in other_y_list if y < y_low or y > y_high)
                        triangle_count %= MOD
    
    return triangle_count

def write_output(answer):

    else:
        answer = solve_problem2(points)
    write_output(answer)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

This solution now handles the uniqueness of the triangles by counting third points only if they fall strictly outside the vertical range defined by the y-coordinates of the base. The count should now match the expected output.

The previous solution still does not provide the correct result because it does not correctly count the triangles. The issue lies in the selection of the third point. The third point must be such that the line connecting it to any point in the base is not parallel to the OY axis.

To correctly implement the solution for problem 2, we can follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the points to get the list of unique x-coordinates and sort them.
2. For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate (forming a potential base of the triangle), count all points that can be the third vertex of the triangle. The third point must have a different x-coordinate and should not form a vertical line with either of the two base points, meaning its y-coordinate must be unique compared to those of the base points.

This approach ensures that no side of the triangle is parallel to the OY axis.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution to the problem

MOD = 1000003

def read_input():

    unique_xs = list(x_to_ys.keys())

                third_ys = x_to_ys[third_x]

                        triangle_count += len(base_ys) * (len(base_ys) - 1) // 2
                        triangle_count %= MOD
                # We counted all triangles with bases at base_x and third point at third_x.

This corrected solution now only counts triangles with all vertices in the given points, one base parallel to the OX axis, and no sides parallel to the OY axis. The triangle count is incremented for each valid combination of base and third point, and we take care to only count third points whose y-coordinate is not equal to the y-coordinates of the base points. This should yield the correct output for the given problem.

The previous solution still has a bug because it incorrectly counts the triangles and it breaks the loop prematurely, which causes it to miss valid triangles. The correct implementation should consider every combination of base and third point without missing any valid cases.

Below is the correct implementation:

This solution should now correctly count all triangles that have a base parallel to the OX axis and no sides parallel to the OY axis. It does so by considering all unique pairs of y-coordinates at a given x-coordinate as the base of the triangle and then looks for valid third points with different x-coordinates and y-coordinates that are not between the y-coordinates of the base.

Upon reviewing the previous solutions and the requirements of the problem, it's clear that the solution for problem 2 still has a bug that results in an incorrect triangle count. The issue lies in the failure to properly iterate over all pairs of points with the same x-coordinate (forming the base of potential triangles) and then find a valid third point with a different x-coordinate to complete the triangle according to the given conditions.

Let's rectify the approach for problem 2:

1. For each x-coordinate, count the number of y-coordinates present.
2. For each x-coordinate, we can form `C(n, 2)` base lines among the points, where `n` is the number of points with that x-coordinate.
3. For each base line, we can choose any point with a different x-coordinate to form a triangle, as long as its y-coordinate is different from the y-coordinates of the base points.

The corrected solution is as follows:

```python
# Corrected solution for the programming challenge

from collections import defaultdict

def solve_problem2(points):
    # Calculate the number of points with each x-coordinate
    x_count = defaultdict(int)
    # Calculate the number of points with each x and y coordinate
    xy_count = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
    
    # Fill in the dictionaries with the input data
    for x, y in points:
        x_count[x] += 1
        xy_count[x][y] += 1
    
    # Initialize the number of triangles to zero
    triangles = 0
    
    # Check points for each x-coordinate to form the base of the triangle
    for base_x in x_count:
        # We only care about x-coordinates with more than 1 point
        if x_count[base_x] > 1:
            # For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate
            for base_y1 in xy_count[base_x]:
                for base_y2 in xy_count[base_x]:
                    if base_y1 < base_y2:
                        # For the base formed by (base_x, base_y1) and (base_x, base_y2)
                        # we find third points with different x-coordinates
                        for x in x_count:
                            if x != base_x:
                                # For each x-coordinate different from the base,
                                # we count all points that are not vertically aligned with the base
                                triangles += x_count[x] - xy_count[x][base_y1] - xy_count[x][base_y2]
    
    # Return the number of triangles modulo 1,000,003
    return triangles % 1000003

def main():
    with open("triunghiuri.in", "r") as fin:
        p = int(fin.readline())
        N = int(fin.readline())
        points = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

    if p == 1:
        # Solve problem 1
        answer = max(points.count(point) for point in set(points))
    else:
        # Solve problem 2
        answer = solve_problem2(points)

    with open("triunghiuri.out", "w") as fout:
        fout.write(f"{answer}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the number of triangles according to the problem statement. For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate, we consider all other points with different x-coordinates and y-coordinates to form valid triangles. The number of valid triangles is then calculated and written to the file "triunghiuri.out".
