Doi copii vopsesc un gard alcătuit din $n$ scânduri pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $n$ astfel: primul ia o cutie de vopsea roșie cu care vopsește scândurile cu numărul $p$, $2 \cdot p$, $3 \cdot p$, etc. Al doilea procedează la fel, începe de la același capăt al gardului, dar ia o cutie de vopsea albastră și vopsește din $q$ în $q$ scânduri. Astfel, când vor termina de vopsit, gardul va avea multe scânduri nevopsite, unele scânduri vopsite în roșu, altele în albastru, iar altele în violet (cele care au fost vopsite și cu roșu și cu albastru).

# Cerință

Cunoscând numerele $n, p$ și $q$ afișați:

1. câte scânduri rămân nevopsite
2. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în roșu
3. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în albastru
4. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în violet

# Date de intrare

De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `gardul.in` se citește valoarea $n$, reprezentând numărul de scânduri din gard. De pe cea de a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se citesc valorile $p$ și $q$ separate de un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `gardul.out` se vor afișa, în ordine, cele patru numere naturale cerute, câte unul pe un rând, ca în exemplu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq p, q \leq 40 \ 000$;

The initial solution calculates the number of painted boards incorrectly because it does not correctly account for the overlap of red and blue painted boards (boards painted violet). The calculation for `painted_violet` assumes that `p` and `q` are coprime. However, if they are not coprime, the least common multiple (LCM) of `p` and `q` should be used instead of their product to determine the overlap.

To fix this, we need to calculate the LCM of `p` and `q` to find the correct number of boards that are painted violet. Let's write a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and then use it to calculate the LCM.

Here's the fixed and complete solution:

```python
# gardul.py

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def paint_fence(n, p, q):
    painted_red = n // p
    painted_blue = n // q
    painted_violet = n // lcm(p, q)  # Fix: use LCM to calculate the overlap
    unpainted = n - painted_red - painted_blue + painted_violet
    return unpainted, painted_red, painted_blue, painted_violet

# Read input from file
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the result
results = paint_fence(n, p, q)

# Write output to file
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This code will now correctly calculate the number of boards that remain unpainted, the number of boards painted in red, in blue, and in violet by considering the least common multiple of `p` and `q` when boards are painted in both colors.

Upon reevaluating the output, it becomes clear that the counts for the number of boards painted red and blue are still incorrect. The error lies in not subtracting the painted_violet count from both the painted_red and painted_blue counts.

Here's the reasoning why:

- `painted_red` should only count boards exclusively painted red (not counting those also painted blue/violet).
- `painted_blue` should only count boards exclusively painted blue (not counting those also painted red/violet).
- `painted_violet` should count boards that are painted both red and blue (violet).

Therefore, we need to subtract `painted_violet` from both `painted_red` and `painted_blue` to account for the overlap correctly. Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# gardul.py

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def paint_fence(n, p, q):
    # Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) for red and blue paint
    common_multiple = lcm(p, q)

    # Count how many boards are painted red, blue, and violet
    painted_red = n // p
    painted_blue = n // q
    painted_violet = n // common_multiple

    # Fix: Adjust red and blue counts to exclude violet (overlap) boards
    painted_red -= painted_violet
    painted_blue -= painted_violet

    # Calculate the number of unpainted boards
    unpainted = n - (painted_red + painted_blue + painted_violet)
    
    return unpainted, painted_red, painted_blue, painted_violet

# Read input from file
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the result
results = paint_fence(n, p, q)

# Write output to file
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

With this correction, the program should now produce the expected output. It calculates the number of boards painted specifically red and blue, while correctly accounting for the overlap of violet boards. It then computes the number of unpainted boards by subtracting the counts of painted boards from the total.
