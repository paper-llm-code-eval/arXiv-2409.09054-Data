Doi copii vopsesc un gard alcătuit din $n$ scânduri pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $n$ astfel: primul ia o cutie de vopsea roșie cu care vopsește scândurile cu numărul $p$, $2 \cdot p$, $3 \cdot p$, etc. Al doilea procedează la fel, începe de la același capăt al gardului, dar ia o cutie de vopsea albastră și vopsește din $q$ în $q$ scânduri. Astfel, când vor termina de vopsit, gardul va avea multe scânduri nevopsite, unele scânduri vopsite în roșu, altele în albastru, iar altele în violet (cele care au fost vopsite și cu roșu și cu albastru).

# Cerință

Cunoscând numerele $n, p$ și $q$ afișați:

1. câte scânduri rămân nevopsite
2. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în roșu
3. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în albastru
4. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în violet

# Date de intrare

De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `gardul.in` se citește valoarea $n$, reprezentând numărul de scânduri din gard. De pe cea de a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se citesc valorile $p$ și $q$ separate de un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `gardul.out` se vor afișa, în ordine, cele patru numere naturale cerute, câte unul pe un rând, ca în exemplu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq p, q \leq 40 \ 000$;

Here is the revised solution, adhering strictly to the constraints and writing the output to `gardul.out`:

```python
# Read input data
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate numbers of painted planks
painted_red = n // p
painted_blue = n // q

# Calculate the number of planks painted in both colors
painted_violet = n // (p * q if p * q <= n else 1)

# Calculate the numbers of unpainted planks
unpainted = n - painted_red - painted_blue + painted_violet

# Write output data
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{unpainted}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_red}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_blue}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_violet}\n')
```

This version calculates the number of boards painted in each color and those left unpainted, then writes the results to `gardul.out`.

The original solution has an issue with calculating the number of planks painted in both colors (violet). It is using the formula `n // (p * q)`, which is only correct if `p` and `q` are coprime. When `p` and `q` are not coprime, we must find the least common multiple (LCM) of `p` and `q` to correctly calculate the number of boards that are painted violet.

If `p` and `q` share any common factors, then some planks counted in `painted_red` and `painted_blue` are being double-counted in `painted_violet`. To fix this, we use the LCM of `p` and `q` to find the count of planks that are painted violet.

Here's the corrected solution that calculates the LCM to determine the correct count of planks painted violet:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM)
def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)

# Read input data
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate numbers of painted planks
painted_red = n // p
painted_blue = n // q

# Calculate the number of planks painted in both colors (violet)
# Using LCM of p and q
lcm_pq = lcm(p, q)
painted_violet = n // lcm_pq

# Calculate the numbers of unpainted planks
unpainted = n - painted_red - painted_blue + painted_violet

# Write output data
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{unpainted}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_red}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_blue}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_violet}\n')
```

Now the code correctly calculates the LCM of `p` and `q` and uses it to find the number of planks painted violet. The output should now match the expected result for the given input.

Upon examining the results and the provided code, it seems there was a mistake in calculating the number of planks painted red and blue. We incorrectly counted all multiples of `p` and `q` without considering the overlap (violet planks) properly. To correct this, we need to subtract the number of violet planks (that we double-counted) from both the red and blue counts.

Let's fix the code with the correct calculations:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD)
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) using the GCD
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Read input data
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate numbers of painted planks
painted_red = n // p
painted_blue = n // q

# Calculate the number of planks painted in both colors (violet)
lcm_pq = lcm(p, q)
painted_violet = n // lcm_pq

# Adjust the counts for red and blue by subtracting the violet count (which was double-counted)
painted_red -= painted_violet
painted_blue -= painted_violet

# Calculate the numbers of unpainted planks
unpainted = n - painted_red - painted_blue - painted_violet

# Write output data
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{unpainted}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_red}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_blue}\n')
    file.write(f'{painted_violet}\n')
```

With this correction, the code accounts for the violet planks properly when calculating the red and blue counts and ensures that the unpainted count is correct by subtracting all painted planks from the total. This should yield the expected output for the given input.
