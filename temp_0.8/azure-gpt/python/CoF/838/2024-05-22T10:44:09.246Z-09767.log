Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

The difference in the output is due to an error in the `min_increasing_subsequences` function. The function needs to calculate the minimum number of increasing subsequences that the original sequence can be partitioned into, not just count the decreases in the sequence.

To fix the issue, we need to use a different approach. A common method involves using patience sorting or a similar technique that can compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), which then helps to determine the number of such subsequences needed to partition the original sequence.

The logic for calculating the number of continuous subsequences with sum divisible by k is correct, so we will keep the `count_sequences` function as is.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def patience_sort_modified(s):
    # Use a modified patience sort to count the minimum number of increasing subsequences.
    piles = []
    for num in s:
        placed = False
        for pile in piles:
            if pile[-1] >= num:
                pile.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append([num])
    return len(piles)

def count_sequences(s, k):
    # Count the number of continuous subsequences with sum divisible by k.
    mod = 20011
    prefix_counts = [0] * k
    prefix_counts[0] = 1
    sum = 0
    seq_count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        sum = (sum + s[i]) % k
        seq_count = (seq_count + prefix_counts[sum]) % mod
        prefix_counts[sum] += 1
    return seq_count

def solve():
    # Read from calcule.in
    with open('calcule.in', 'r') as fin:
        n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        s = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    
    # Calculate answers for a) and b)
    min_partitions = patience_sort_modified(s)
    seq_count = count_sequences(s, k)
    
    # Write output to calcule.out
    with open('calcule.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{min_partitions}\n")
        fout.write(f"{seq_count}\n")

# Execute the solve function
solve()
```

The output provided in the last reply is actually correct and matches the expected output. It seems there might have been a misinterpretation of the results. The fixed implementation for `min_increasing_subsequences` correctly computes the minimum number of increasing subsequences (4 in this case), and the `count_sequences` function correctly calculates the number of continuous subsequences with a sum divisible by k (23 in this case).

The previous difference in results was due to an incorrect implementation of the `min_increasing_subsequences` function, which was counting the decreases in the sequence rather than partitioning it into the minimum number of increasing subsequences.

In the revised solution, `patience_sort_modified` is used to correctly calculate the number of piles (or increasing subsequences) created, which corresponds to the minimum number of increasing subsequences needed to partition the sequence. The `count_sequences` function was already correct, so there was no change needed there.

The results now match the expected output, and there are no more discrepancies.

For completeness, here is the fixed solution again, which should not require any further changes:

```python
def patience_sort_modified(s):
    # Use a modified patience sort to count the minimum number of increasing subsequences.
    piles = []
    for num in s:
        placed = False
        for pile in piles:
            if pile[-1] >= num:
                pile.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append([num])
    return len(piles)

def count_sequences(s, k):
    # Count the number of continuous subsequences with sum divisible by k.
    mod = 20011
    prefix_counts = [0] * k
    prefix_counts[0] = 1
    sum = 0
    seq_count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        sum = (sum + s[i]) % k
        seq_count = (seq_count + prefix_counts[sum]) % mod
        prefix_counts[sum] += 1
    return seq_count

def solve():
    # Read from calcule.in
    with open('calcule.in', 'r') as fin:
        n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        s = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    
    # Calculate answers for a) and b)
    min_partitions = patience_sort_modified(s)
    seq_count = count_sequences(s, k)
    
    # Write output to calcule.out
    with open('calcule.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{min_partitions}\n")
        fout.write(f"{seq_count}\n")

# Execute the solve function
solve()
```

This code correctly reads from `calcule.in` and writes the expected results to `calcule.out`.

Apologies for any confusion. From the information provided, the expected output and found output are identical:

```
4 
23
```

This means that the solution with the fixed `patience_sort_modified` function for part (a) and the correct `count_sequences` function for part (b) is providing the correct output. There is no difference between the expected and found result, so the solution is correctly implemented.

There is no need to rewrite or modify the current solution since it already meets the requirements and provides the expected output. The confusion might have arisen from a mistake in the evaluation of the results. The solution provided in the previous response is correct and does not require any additional fixes.
