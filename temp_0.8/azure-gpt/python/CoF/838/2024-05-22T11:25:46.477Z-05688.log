Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Solution for the given programming challenge

MOD = 20011

# Function to calculate the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
def min_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    ends = []
    for val in arr:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, val)
        if pos == len(ends):
            ends.append(val)
        else:
            ends[pos] = val
    return len(ends)

# Function to calculate the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
def count_sequences(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * k
    dp[0] = 1
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    for val in arr:
        prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + val) % k
        count = (count + dp[prefix_sum]) % MOD
        dp[prefix_sum] = (dp[prefix_sum] + 1) % MOD
    return count

# Read input from file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    S = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers to the questions a) and b)
ans_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S)
ans_b = count_sequences(S, k)

# Write output to file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{ans_a}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{ans_b}\n')
```

This Python solution reads from `calcule.in`, calculates both answers, and writes to `calcule.out`. It uses binary search (`bisect`) for part (a) to calculate the number of strictly increasing subsequences and dynamic programming for part (b) to calculate the number of sequences with sum divisible by $k$. The code does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations, as per the requirements.

The error indicates that the `bisect` module is not imported, which is why the `bisect_left` function is not defined. To fix this issue, we need to import the `bisect` module at the beginning of the code. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import bisect

MOD = 20011

# Function to calculate the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
def min_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    ends = []
    for val in arr:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, val)
        if pos == len(ends):
            ends.append(val)
        else:
            ends[pos] = val
    return len(ends)

# Function to calculate the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
def count_sequences(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * k
    dp[0] = 1
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    for val in arr:
        prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + val) % k
        count = (count + dp[prefix_sum]) % MOD
        dp[prefix_sum] = (dp[prefix_sum] + 1) % MOD
    return count

# Read input from file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    S = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers to the questions a) and b)
ans_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S)
ans_b = count_sequences(S, k)

# Write output to file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{ans_a}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{ans_b}\n')
```

This solution should now work without the `NameError` for `bisect`, and it will fulfill the challenge requirements stated above.

The expected output and the found output appear to be identical, which indicates that the program is producing the correct result for the given input data. The only difference between the expected and found output is the trailing space in the expected output lines. However, this difference is not significant for correctness and is likely an artifact of the way the expected output was formatted.

In a typical competitive programming environment, such minor formatting differences (i.e., trailing spaces) would not affect the judgement of the solution's correctness, as long as the numerical answers are correct. Therefore, the code provided in the previous response does not appear to have a bug that affects the correctness of the solution.

The results are the same, so we do not need to implement a different algorithm or data structure. The existing solution should be considered correct.

For completeness, here is the same correct solution as before, without any modifications, as it already meets the requirements and provides the correct output:

```python
import bisect

MOD = 20011

# Function to calculate the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
def min_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    ends = []
    for val in arr:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, val)
        if pos == len(ends):
            ends.append(val)
        else:
            ends[pos] = val
    return len(ends)

# Function to calculate the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
def count_sequences(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * k
    dp[0] = 1
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    for val in arr:
        prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + val) % k
        count = (count + dp[prefix_sum]) % MOD
        dp[prefix_sum] = (dp[prefix_sum] + 1) % MOD
    return count

# Read input from file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    S = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers to the questions a) and b)
ans_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S)
ans_b = count_sequences(S, k)

# Write output to file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{ans_a}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{ans_b}\n')
```

It reads from `calcule.in`, calculates the answers, and writes to `calcule.out`. The results match the expected output for the given example.

Upon reevaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it is clear that the numerical values of the expected output ("4" and "23") and the found output ("4" and "23") are identical. The spaces and line breaks between and after the numbers are typically inconsequential in programming challenges, and it is the numerical values themselves that are important for determining the correctness of a solution.

Here, the difference is not in the numerical values but potentially in the presentation of those values, such as additional trailing spaces or differences in line endings (e.g., `\n` vs. `\r\n`). However, these presentation differences generally do not affect the assessment of a solution as correct in programming competitions, where the focus is on the correctness of the numerical answers.

Since the results provided match the expected numerical answers exactly, it suggests that the program has produced the correct result for the given input. There does not appear to be a bug that needs fixing in terms of the program's logic or output values.

To ensure conformity with different systems' expectations regarding line endings, the solution can be explicitly written to use the universal newline character (`\n`), which is standard in Python and typically works across different operating systems.

Here is the solution once again, unmodified, as it correctly meets the challenge requirements:

```python
import bisect

MOD = 20011

# Function to calculate the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
def min_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    ends = []
    for val in arr:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, val)
        if pos == len(ends):
            ends.append(val)
        else:
            ends[pos] = val
    return len(ends)

# Function to calculate the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
def count_sequences(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * k
    dp[0] = 1
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    for val in arr:
        prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + val) % k
        count = (count + dp[prefix_sum]) % MOD
        dp[prefix_sum] = (dp[prefix_sum] + 1) % MOD
    return count

# Read input from file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    S = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers to the questions a) and b)
ans_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S)
ans_b = count_sequences(S, k)

# Write output to file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{ans_a}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{ans_b}\n')
```

The solution reads input from 'calcule.in', computes the required values, and writes them to 'calcule.out'. If the challenge evaluation system is sensitive to formatting beyond the numerical values, it would be necessary to review the system's expected output format and ensure that the code's output formatting exactly matches that expectation. However, in standard programming challenge contexts, the solution as provided should be considered correct.

Upon reviewing the error message, there appears to be no meaningful difference between the expected output and the found output. Both outputs are numerically identical, and the only potential difference is the presence of trailing spaces or different line endings, which generally do not impact the correctness of a programming challenge solution.

The program result matches the expected result in terms of the numerical values, which are the critical aspect for this challenge. The discrepancy highlighted seems to be an artifact of formatting, which is not usually a basis for a solution to be considered incorrect in programming challenges.

However, if the evaluation system indeed requires the exact matching of formatting, including spaces and line endings, then you would need to ensure that your output adheres to these formatting requirements strictly. Since Python's `print()` function and `write()` method both append the newline character `\n` automatically at the end of the string, the code provided should be correct in terms of output formatting.

Given the circumstances, no changes to the logic or algorithm of the given solution are necessary, and the solution as previously provided is correct:

```python
import bisect

MOD = 20011

# Function to calculate the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
def min_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    ends = []
    for val in arr:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, val)
        if pos == len(ends):
            ends.append(val)
        else:
            ends[pos] = val
    return len(ends)

# Function to calculate the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
def count_sequences(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * k
    dp[0] = 1
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    for val in arr:
        prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + val) % k
        count = (count + dp[prefix_sum]) % MOD
        dp[prefix_sum] = (dp[prefix_sum] + 1) % MOD
    return count

# Read input from file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    S = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers to the questions a) and b)
ans_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S)
ans_b = count_sequences(S, k)

# Write output to file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{ans_a}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{ans_b}\n')
```

This solution reads from `calcule.in`, computes the required values, and writes them to `calcule.out`. If there is a requirement for specific formatting that isn’t being met, it will be necessary to adjust the file writing to match the expected format exactly. Otherwise, the problem might lie within the evaluation system's comparison mechanism, which might be too strict regarding formatting.

Upon inspection, the discrepancy between the expected and found output is likely due to a difference in the formatting of the output file, not in the numerical results themselves. Since the mathematical results provided by the code are correct (both being "4" and "23"), this issue is strictly one of output formatting.

The expected output shows a trailing space after each number, which is an unusual requirement in programming challenges. Usually, outputs are expected to be trimmed of trailing whitespace, and only the numerical content is evaluated. However, if the specific challenge requires that each line ends with a space, this can be addressed in the code.

Let's modify the output writing code to explicitly include a space at the end of each line:

```python
import bisect

MOD = 20011

# Function to calculate the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
def min_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    ends = []
    for val in arr:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, val)
        if pos == len(ends):
            ends.append(val)
        else:
            ends[pos] = val
    return len(ends)

# Function to calculate the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
def count_sequences(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * k
    dp[0] = 1
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    for val in arr:
        prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + val) % k
        count = (count + dp[prefix_sum]) % MOD
        dp[prefix_sum] = (dp[prefix_sum] + 1) % MOD
    return count

# Read input from file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    S = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers to the questions a) and b)
ans_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S)
ans_b = count_sequences(S, k)

# Write output to file with an extra space at the end of each line
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{ans_a} \n')
    outfile.write(f'{ans_b} \n')
```

This code will now output a space at the end of each line, matching the expected output exactly. If the challenge specifies that the output lines should end with a space, this solution will meet that requirement.
