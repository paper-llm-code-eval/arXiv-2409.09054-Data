În Munții Apuseni, din cauza condițiilor meteo nefavorabile din ultimul timp, transportul pe drumurile publice a devenit o problemă. S-au surpat porțiuni din drum, s-au rupt poduri și podețe, au căzut pomi peste șosea si multe altele. Au rămas astfel grupuri de case izolate, oamenii nemaiputând ajunge la oraș pentru a-și procura cele necesare. Pentru a ajunge la oraș, oamenii au construit o telecabină care leagă regiunile izolate, telecabină care a fost proiectată suficient de încăpătoare, astfel încât, în fiecare moment să fie posibil să urce toți oamenii care se află într-o stație.
Pentru fiecare dintre cele n stații ale telecabinei se cunoaște altitudinea (exprimată în metri) și numărul de persoane care urcă în telecabină. De asemenea, se știe că telecabina consumă $3$ litri/m de combustibil la urcare și $1$ litru/m de combustibil la coborâre. Distanțele între stații se echivalează practic cu diferențele de altitudini dintre stații. O stație în care se schimbă felul de deplasare, din urcare se trece în coborâre sau invers se numește stație specială.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine câți oameni ajung la oraș cu telecabina, care este consumul telecabinei pentru transport și câte stații speciale există.

# Date de intrare


De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `telecabina.in` se citește valoarea $n$, reprezentând numărul de stații (inclusiv orașul). De pe următoarele n linii ale fișierului de intrare se citesc apoi $n$ perechi de numere naturale `a b`, câte o pereche pe linie, unde $a$ reprezintă altitudinea stației, iar $b$ numărul de oameni care urcă în telecabină în stația respectivă. Între $a$ și $b$ există exact un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


Pe primul rând al fișierului de ieșire `telecabina.out` se va afișa numărul de oameni care ajung la oraș. Pe al doilea rând al fișierului se va afișa consumul telecabinei pentru transport. Pe al treilea rând al fișierului se va afișa numărul de stații speciale.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 40$;
* $1 \leq a \leq 2 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq b \leq 20$;
* altitudinile oricăror două stații consecutive sunt diferite
* în ultima stație (la oraș) nu urcă nici o persoană

The discrepancy between the expected and found results lies in the counting of special stations. The logic for determining special stations seems to be flawed. A station should be considered special if the direction of movement (uphill or downhill) changes compared to the previous movement.

Let's fix the logic for that:

- We need to correctly identify when the telecabina changes from ascending to descending and vice versa. This happens when the sign of the difference in altitude between the current station and the next station is different from the sign of the difference in altitude between the current station and the previous station.
- We need to update the people count correctly at the end of the loop. In the last station, people do not get on, so we need to add the people from the last but one station.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('telecabina.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    stations = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Variables to store the results
people_in_city = 0
total_fuel = 0
special_stations = 0

# Determine direction of the first leg (uphill or downhill)
ascending = True if stations[1][0] > stations[0][0] else False

# Process each station starting from the second one
for i in range(1, n):
    altitude, people = stations[i]
    prev_altitude, _ = stations[i - 1]

    # Update people count
    people_in_city += people

    # Fuel consumption and altitudes difference
    altitude_diff = abs(altitude - prev_altitude)
    if altitude > prev_altitude:  # Ascending
        total_fuel += altitude_diff * 3
        if not ascending:
            special_stations += 1
            ascending = True
    else:  # Descending
        total_fuel += altitude_diff
        if ascending:
            special_stations += 1
            ascending = False

# Update the people count for the last but one station (the last station has 0 people boarding)
people_in_city += stations[-2][1]

# Write output data to file
with open('telecabina.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{people_in_city}\n{total_fuel}\n{special_stations}\n')
```

This solution should correctly calculate the number of people arriving in the city, the total fuel consumption, and the number of special stations based on the given input data.

Upon re-evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it's clear that we are incorrectly calculating the number of people who arrive in the city. The given solution mistakenly added the people from the last but one station twice. The number of people should be accumulated as the telecabina moves from station to station, and we should not add the people from the last but one station again at the end.

Here is the re-implementation with the necessary fixes:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('telecabina.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    stations = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Variables to store the results
people_in_city = 0
total_fuel = 0
special_stations = 0

# Initial altitude and direction (ascending: True, descending: False)
current_altitude = stations[0][0]
ascending = None

# Process each station
for i in range(1, n):
    next_altitude, people_at_station = stations[i]
    altitude_diff = abs(next_altitude - current_altitude)

    # Determine if ascending or descending and calculate fuel consumption
    if next_altitude > current_altitude:
        total_fuel += altitude_diff * 3
        next_ascending = True
    else:
        total_fuel += altitude_diff
        next_ascending = False

    # Check if the station is special
    if ascending is not None and next_ascending != ascending:
        special_stations += 1
    
    # Update the current state for the next iteration
    current_altitude = next_altitude
    ascending = next_ascending

    # Update the number of people who will arrive at the city
    people_in_city += people_at_station

# Write output data to file
with open('telecabina.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{people_in_city}\n{total_fuel}\n{special_stations}\n')
```

This solution should calculate the number of people who arrive in the city correctly, as well as the total fuel consumption and the number of special stations. It keeps track of the ascending status and updates the number of special stations only when the direction of movement changes. Additionally, it correctly accumulates the number of people at each station without double-counting.

After reviewing the output again, the calculation of the number of people arriving in the city is still incorrect. It seems that my previous solution only accumulated people at each station without considering that all people from the starting station also reach the city.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('telecabina.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    stations = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Variables to store the results
people_in_city = stations[0][1]  # Start with the initial number of people at the first station
total_fuel = 0
special_stations = 0

# Initial altitude and direction (ascending: True, descending: False)
current_altitude = stations[0][0]

# Initialize the direction of the telecabina movement based on the first two stations
ascending = None
if n > 1:
    ascending = stations[1][0] > current_altitude

# Process each station from the second one
for i in range(1, n):
    next_altitude, people_at_station = stations[i]
    altitude_diff = abs(next_altitude - current_altitude)

    # Determine if ascending or descending and calculate fuel consumption
    if next_altitude > current_altitude:
        total_fuel += altitude_diff * 3
        next_ascending = True
    else:
        total_fuel += altitude_diff
        next_ascending = False

    # Check if the station is special
    if ascending is not None and next_ascending != ascending:
        special_stations += 1
    
    # Update the current state for the next iteration
    ascending = next_ascending
    current_altitude = next_altitude

    # Accumulate the number of people
    people_in_city += people_at_station

# Write output data to file
with open('telecabina.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{people_in_city}\n{total_fuel}\n{special_stations}\n')
```

With this fix, the solution starts with the number of people at the first station and then accumulates the number of people at each subsequent station. It also properly manages the detection of special stations by considering the change in movement direction. Now, the output should match the expected result.
