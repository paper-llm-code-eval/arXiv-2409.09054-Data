În Munții Apuseni, din cauza condițiilor meteo nefavorabile din ultimul timp, transportul pe drumurile publice a devenit o problemă. S-au surpat porțiuni din drum, s-au rupt poduri și podețe, au căzut pomi peste șosea si multe altele. Au rămas astfel grupuri de case izolate, oamenii nemaiputând ajunge la oraș pentru a-și procura cele necesare. Pentru a ajunge la oraș, oamenii au construit o telecabină care leagă regiunile izolate, telecabină care a fost proiectată suficient de încăpătoare, astfel încât, în fiecare moment să fie posibil să urce toți oamenii care se află într-o stație.
Pentru fiecare dintre cele n stații ale telecabinei se cunoaște altitudinea (exprimată în metri) și numărul de persoane care urcă în telecabină. De asemenea, se știe că telecabina consumă $3$ litri/m de combustibil la urcare și $1$ litru/m de combustibil la coborâre. Distanțele între stații se echivalează practic cu diferențele de altitudini dintre stații. O stație în care se schimbă felul de deplasare, din urcare se trece în coborâre sau invers se numește stație specială.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine câți oameni ajung la oraș cu telecabina, care este consumul telecabinei pentru transport și câte stații speciale există.

# Date de intrare


De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `telecabina.in` se citește valoarea $n$, reprezentând numărul de stații (inclusiv orașul). De pe următoarele n linii ale fișierului de intrare se citesc apoi $n$ perechi de numere naturale `a b`, câte o pereche pe linie, unde $a$ reprezintă altitudinea stației, iar $b$ numărul de oameni care urcă în telecabină în stația respectivă. Între $a$ și $b$ există exact un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


Pe primul rând al fișierului de ieșire `telecabina.out` se va afișa numărul de oameni care ajung la oraș. Pe al doilea rând al fișierului se va afișa consumul telecabinei pentru transport. Pe al treilea rând al fișierului se va afișa numărul de stații speciale.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 40$;
* $1 \leq a \leq 2 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq b \leq 20$;
* altitudinile oricăror două stații consecutive sunt diferite
* în ultima stație (la oraș) nu urcă nici o persoană

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it appears that the number of people calculated to arrive in the city is incorrect. The expected number of people is 23, while the output from the code is 20. This discrepancy arises because the people in the last station (the city) are not being counted, since they should not be counted according to the problem statement which says "în ultima stație (la oraș) nu urcă nici o persoană" (in the last station (the city) no one boards). 

The fuel consumption and the number of special stations are correct. The bug in the program must be related to how we're counting the people. The code should be iterating over all stations, except the last one when counting people. Let's fix the iteration range when counting people.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('telecabina.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    stations = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize variables
people_in_cabin = 0
fuel_consumed = 0
previous_altitude = stations[0][0]
special_stations = 0

# Process each station
for i in range(1, n):
    altitude, people = stations[i]
    delta_altitude = altitude - previous_altitude
    if delta_altitude > 0:
        # Consumption during ascent
        fuel_consumed += 3 * delta_altitude
    else:
        # Consumption during descent
        fuel_consumed += -delta_altitude

    # Check if the station is special
    if i > 1:
        prev_delta = stations[i - 1][0] - stations[i - 2][0]
        if (delta_altitude > 0 and prev_delta < 0) or (delta_altitude < 0 and prev_delta > 0):
            special_stations += 1

    # Update the number of people in the cabin, excluding the last station
    if i < n - 1:
        people_in_cabin += people

    # Update the previous altitude
    previous_altitude = altitude

# Write output data
with open('telecabina.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{people_in_cabin}\n{fuel_consumed}\n{special_stations}\n")
```

This corrected code will count the number of people correctly, exclude the last station when counting people, and maintain the correct computation of fuel consumption and special stations.

From the expected output and the given input, it's clear that there's a mistake in my previous explanation. The output discrepancy is indeed due to the count of people. The code did not consider people at the first station (1200m altitude with 3 people). Since the problem statement says that "în fiecare moment să fie posibil să urce toți oamenii care se află într-o stație" (at any given moment, all people at a station can board the cable car), we must include the people from the very first station in the count, which the initial implementation failed to do.

Let's fix the solution by including the people from the first station in the count of the people_in_cabin variable.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('telecabina.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    stations = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        stations.append((a, b))

# Initialize variables
people_in_cabin = stations[0][1]  # Include people from the first station
fuel_consumed = 0
previous_altitude = stations[0][0]
special_stations = -1  # Start from -1 to exclude the first station as a special station

# Process each station
for i in range(1, n):
    altitude, people = stations[i]
    delta_altitude = altitude - previous_altitude
    if delta_altitude > 0:
        # Consumption during ascent
        fuel_consumed += 3 * delta_altitude
    else:
        # Consumption during descent
        fuel_consumed += -delta_altitude

    # Check if the station is special
    if i > 1 and (delta_altitude > 0) != (stations[i - 1][0] > previous_altitude):
        special_stations += 1

    # Update the number of people in the cabin, if it's not the last station
    if i < n - 1:
        people_in_cabin += people

    # Update the previous altitude
    previous_altitude = altitude

# Write output data
with open('telecabina.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{people_in_cabin}\n{fuel_consumed}\n{special_stations}\n")
```

This code accounts for the people at the first station and maintains the correct computation of fuel consumption and special stations. The special stations count starts from -1 because the problem's description suggests that the first station cannot be a special station, as there's no previous station to compare the change in altitude.

Upon reviewing the output discrepancy, it is clear that the count for special stations is incorrect in the current solution. The special stations count is 1 less than expected. According to the input data, there are two points at which the telecabin changes from ascending to descending or vice versa:

1. From station at 1204m to 1199m (descending starts)
2. From station at 1197m to 1202m (ascending starts)

These are the two special stations, and the code should reflect this by counting both.

The logic error in the code is in the detection of the special stations. The condition `(delta_altitude > 0) != (stations[i - 1][0] > previous_altitude)` is incorrect because it only checks the relationship between the current and the previous station, while it should be checking the relationship between the current station, the previous station, and the station before the previous one to determine the change in direction.

Let's fix the logic for detecting special stations.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('telecabina.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    stations = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize variables
people_in_cabin = stations[0][1]  # Include people from the first station
fuel_consumed = 0
previous_altitude = stations[0][0]
special_stations = 0
ascending = True  # Track the current direction of the telecabin

# Process each station
for i in range(1, n):
    altitude, people = stations[i]
    delta_altitude = altitude - previous_altitude
    if delta_altitude > 0:
        # Consumption during ascent
        fuel_consumed += 3 * delta_altitude
        # If previously it was descending, this is a special station
        if not ascending:
            special_stations += 1
            ascending = True
    else:
        # Consumption during descent
        fuel_consumed += -delta_altitude
        # If previously it was ascending, this is a special station
        if ascending:
            special_stations += 1
            ascending = False

    # Update the number of people in the cabin, except at the last station
    if i < n - 1:
        people_in_cabin += people

    # Update the previous altitude
    previous_altitude = altitude

# Write output data
with open('telecabina.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{people_in_cabin}\n{fuel_consumed}\n{special_stations}\n")
```

This code should now correctly count the number of special stations by detecting changes in the direction of travel between stations, and it will output the correct count of people arriving in the city and the correct fuel consumption.
