Se consideră un triunghi alcătuit din numere naturale scrise pe $n$ linii ca în figura alăturată. Liniile triunghiului sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, începând cu linia de la baza triunghiului (linia de jos), iar poziţiile pe linie sunt numerotate începând cu $1$ de la stânga la dreapta.
Fiecare număr din triunghi, exceptând pe cele de pe linia $1$, este egal cu suma numerelor aflate imediat sub el, în stânga şi respectiv în dreapta lui.

~[triunghi.png|width=20em]

# Cerință

Cunoscând câte un număr de pe fiecare linie a triunghiului, determinaţi toate numerele de pe linia $1$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `triunghi.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii din triunghi. Pe următoarele $n$ linii sunt descrise informaţiile despre triunghi. Mai exact, pe linia $i$ dintre cele $n$ se află două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $p_i \ v_i$ indicând poziţia şi respectiv valoarea numărului cunoscut de pe linia $i$ a triunghiului.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `triunghi.out` va conține o singură linie, pe care se găsesc $n$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând în ordine de la stânga la dreapta numerele scrise pe linia $1$ a triunghiului.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq p_i \leq n+1-i$;
* Toate numerele din triunghi sunt numere naturale cu cel mult $18$ cifre.

It seems that the given solution is encountering an `IndexError` because it is trying to access indices of the `triangle_top_line` that are out of range. In order to fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic to correctly compute the values at each index of the `triangle_top_line` without going out of bounds. Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from 'triunghi.in'
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_positions_and_values = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Determine the top line based on the known positions and values
top_line = [0] * n
for line in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    position, value = known_positions_and_values[line]
    if line == n-1:
        top_line[position-1] = value
    else:
        diff = value - top_line[position-1]
        for i in range(position, position + (n - 1 - line)):
            top_line[i] += diff

# Write to 'triunghi.out'
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, top_line)))
```

This code processes the input data in reverse order (starting from the last line of the triangle and going up to the first), incrementing the values on the top line based on the differences computed from the input. It writes the final top line of the triangle to `triunghi.out`.

The error is caused by attempting to access indexes of the `top_line` list that are out of range. The logic for filling in the `top_line` list needs to be adjusted to ensure that the iteration stays within the bounds of the list.

Here's the corrected solution that takes care of the index ranges:

```python
# Read from 'triunghi.in'
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_values = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Initialize the top line with the known value from the last line and calculate the rest
top_line = [0] * n
for line in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    position, value = known_values[n - 1 - line]
    if line == n - 1:
        # Directly set the known value for the bottom line
        top_line[position - 1] = value
    else:
        # Adjust the values from bottom to top
        diff = value - top_line[position - 1]
        for i in range(position - 1, position + line):
            top_line[i] += diff

# Write to 'triunghi.out'
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, top_line)))
```

In this corrected version, the `top_line` list is filled starting from the bottom line and working upward. For each known value, the difference between it and the current value at the same position in `top_line` is used to update the necessary range of values in `top_line`. This avoids going out of bounds. The final `top_line` is then written to `triunghi.out`.

The incorrect output is due to a misunderstanding of the problem statement. The implementation needs to correctly work its way up from the known values given for each line to deduce the correct values on the first line. Given a row in the triangle, the value above it, on the row immediately preceding it, can be determined by subtracting the value to the right of the target position.

Here's the corrected solution that takes into account the proper logic to fill the top line from the known values:

```python
# Read from 'triunghi.in'
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_values = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Create a list to store the values on the first line
first_line = [0] * n

# Calculate the offset of the known value from the right side of the triangle
for i, (position, value) in enumerate(known_values):
    # Calculate the offset of the given position from the right side
    offset_from_right = n - position

    # Calculate the value for the first line using the offset and known value
    if i == 0:
        first_line[-1] = value  # Directly set the rightmost value
    else:
        first_line[-offset_from_right - 1] = value - first_line[-offset_from_right]

# Calculate the rest of the values for the first line from right to left
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    first_line[i] = known_values[-(i + 2)][1] - first_line[i + 1]

# Write the result to 'triunghi.out'
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, first_line)))
```

This implementation correctly interprets the information from the input file. It starts by setting the rightmost value of the first line, which can be taken directly from the last known value since it's the same. Then, for each subsequent known value from the bottom up, it calculates the associated value on the first line by considering how many positions it is offset from the right. Lastly, it fills in the rest of the first-line values by working from right to left, making use of the known values from the input file. The final `first_line` array is then written to `triunghi.out`.

The results differ because the current logic for computing the numbers on the top line of the triangle based on the known values is incorrect. The proper way to solve this problem is to recognize that each known value provides a constraint on the sum of certain numbers on the top line. Specifically, the known value on the ith line concerns the sum of the numbers in the positions i through p, where p is the position of the known value.

To fix the solution, we can work our way up from the last line to the first, updating the values along the way. For each known value, we can use it to reconstruct the values on the line above, eventually leading to the numbers on the first line.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from 'triunghi.in'
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# We will start from the last known value and work our way up to the first line
# by calculating the necessary differences.

# Initialize the triangle with zeros except for the last line which we know
triangle = [[0]*i for i in range(1, n+1)]
triangle[-1][known[-1][0]-1] = known[-1][1]  # Last line's known value

# Propagate the values upwards to deduce the first line
for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):  # Start from the second last line
    idx, value = known[i]  # The known value and its index on the current line
    # Update the values between the known indices
    left_diff = value - triangle[i+1][idx-1]  # Calculate the left difference
    triangle[i][idx-1] = left_diff  # Update the current line's value
    # Update the subsequent left values on the current line up to the first line
    for j in range(idx-2, -1, -1):
        triangle[i][j] = triangle[i+1][j] - triangle[i][j+1]

# Write the result to 'triunghi.out'
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[0])))
```

This code first initializes a triangle structure with the known value placed on the last line. It then works its way up line by line, using the known value to calculate the difference between the numbers directly below it and to its right, inferring the needed value. This continues until the values for the first line are all computed. Finally, it writes the first line values to `triunghi.out`.

The `IndexError` indicates that we are trying to access an index in the list that does not exist. This happened because the index `idx-1` is outside the bounds of `triangle[i+1]`. We need to account for the fact that as we move up the triangle, the number of elements in each row decreases by one.

To fix the error, we need to compute the correct indices of the elements that need to be accessed and updated. We should calculate the offset from the known position to the right side of the triangle and use this offset to determine which elements to update, starting from the known value and moving left.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from 'triunghi.in'
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_values = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the top line and auxiliary variables
top_line = [0] * n
sums = [0] * (n + 1)

# Reconstruct the top line using the known values starting from the base
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    position, value = known_values[i]
    # Compute the sum of the top line elements up to the current position
    sums[position] = sums[position + 1] + value
    # Derive the value of the top line element at the current position
    top_line[position - 1] = sums[position] - sums[position + 1]

# Calculate the remaining elements of the top line
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    top_line[i] -= top_line[i + 1]

# Write to 'triunghi.out'
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, top_line)))
```

In this corrected version, we start from the last known value and use the differences of known values from each row to reconstruct the top line. We keep track of the cumulative sums on the right side of the triangle with the `sums` array. We then go through the top line and adjust the remaining elements by subtracting the value of the element to their right from their sum. Finally, we write the entire top line to 'triunghi.out'.
