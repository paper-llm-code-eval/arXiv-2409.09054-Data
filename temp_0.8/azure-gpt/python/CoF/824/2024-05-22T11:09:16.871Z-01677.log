# Cerință

Cunoscând câte un număr de pe fiecare linie a triunghiului, determinaţi toate numerele de pe linia $1$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `triunghi.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii din triunghi. Pe următoarele $n$ linii sunt descrise informaţiile despre triunghi. Mai exact, pe linia $i$ dintre cele $n$ se află două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $p_i \ v_i$ indicând poziţia şi respectiv valoarea numărului cunoscut de pe linia $i$ a triunghiului.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `triunghi.out` va conține o singură linie, pe care se găsesc $n$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând în ordine de la stânga la dreapta numerele scrise pe linia $1$ a triunghiului.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read data from "triunghi.in"
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    known_values = [(0, 0)] * n
    for i in range(n):
        p, v = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        known_values[i] = (p, v)

# Reconstruct the triangle starting from the known values
triangle = [[0 for _ in range(i+1)] for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    p, v = known_values[i]
    triangle[i][p-1] = v
    for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
        triangle[j][p-2] = triangle[j+1][p-2] - triangle[j+1][p-1]
        p -= 1

# Write the result to "triunghi.out"
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[0])) + '\n')
```

This code snippet reads the given integer pairs from `triunghi.in` to determine the known values of the triangle. It then reconstructs the entire triangle by calculating each value at the first line using the known values and the property of the triangle, where every number (except those at the base) is equal to the sum of the numbers directly below it and to the right. Finally, it writes the first line of the triangle to `triunghi.out`.

It seems like the code is trying to access an index that does not exist in the list `triangle[j]`. This happens because the algorithm incorrectly assumes the index `p-2` is always valid for the row `j`. However, when the known value is at the first position (`p == 1`), `p-2` becomes `-1`, which is not the intended index.

To fix this issue, we need to check that we only assign values to valid positions in `triangle[j]`. Additionally, we need to correctly calculate values going up the triangle. Let's also ensure that we correctly handle the edge case where the known value is at the first position.

Here is the rewritten and corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from "triunghi.in"
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    known_values = [None] * (n+1)
    for _ in range(n):
        p, v = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        known_values[p] = v

# Reconstruct the triangle starting from the known values
triangle = [[0] * (i+1) for i in range(n)]

# Start from the known values and go upwards
for p in range(1, n+1):
    if known_values[p] is not None:
        v = known_values[p]
        # Initialize the known value at the appropriate level
        triangle[n - p][p - 1] = v
        # Go upward to calculate the values
        for i in range(n - p, 0, -1):
            # Check if the left neighbor exists
            if p > 1:
                triangle[i - 1][p - 2] = triangle[i][p - 2] - triangle[i][p - 1]
            # Check if the right neighbor exists
            if p <= i:
                triangle[i - 1][p - 1] = triangle[i][p - 1] - triangle[i - 1][p - 2]

# Write the result to "triunghi.out"
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[0])) + '\n')
```

This solution reads the input, reconstructs the triangle from the bottom up using known values, and finally writes the numbers at the base of the triangle to the output file.

The error indicates an out-of-range index access in the triangle list. The issue is arising from incorrect indexing when calculating the triangle values. The indices should be adjusted to correctly access the current and previous row values when traversing upwards through the triangle. 

The algorithm needs to be careful in managing the boundaries when accessing elements because when p = i + 1 (the rightmost element of a row), there is no element at index p in the row above, and similarly when p = 1 (the leftmost element of a row), there is no element at index p - 2.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
# Read data from "triunghi.in"
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    known_values = [None] * (n+1)
    for _ in range(n):
        p, v = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        known_values[p] = v

# Reconstruct the triangle starting from the known values
triangle = [[0] * (i+1) for i in range(n)]

# Initialize the bottom-most known value
p_last, v_last = n, known_values[n]
triangle[0][p_last - 1] = v_last

# Calculate values upward using the known values
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    p, v = i, known_values[i]
    # Calculate the value at the position (i, p)
    for j in range(n - i):
        v -= triangle[j][p - 1]
    triangle[n - i][p - 1] = v
    # Calculate the rest of the values in the row
    for j in range(p - 1, 0, -1):
        triangle[n - i][j - 1] = triangle[n - i - 1][j - 1] - triangle[n - i][j]
    for j in range(p - 1, n - i):
        triangle[n - i][j + 1] = triangle[n - i - 1][j] - triangle[n - i][j]

# Write the result to "triunghi.out"
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[n-1])) + '\n')
```

This revised solution properly calculates the values going upwards in the triangle by ensuring that indices are within valid ranges. It iterates from the bottom to the top of the triangle, first filling in the known value for each row, and then calculates the rest of the values in that row using the properties of the triangle. The output is then written to 'triunghi.out'.

The error is indicating that there is an attempt to access an index in the `triangle[0]` list that is out of range. This is incorrect because `triangle[0]` should actually correspond to the bottom row of the triangle, not the top. The top row would be `triangle[n-1]`.

To fix this, we need to correctly initialize the known values in their respective positions in the triangle starting from the bottom up, and then calculate the unknown values based on those known values.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from "triunghi.in"
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    known_values = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        p, v = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        known_values[i] = (p, v)

# Initialize the triangle with zero values
triangle = [[0] * (i + 1) for i in range(n)]

# Start from the known value at the tip and work backwards to find the top line values
for level in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    p, v = known_values[level]
    p -= 1  # Adjusting index to be zero-based
    # Calculate the values at each level based on the known value
    for i in range(level, n - 1):
        v -= triangle[i + 1][p]
        if p > 0:  # Check left bound
            v -= triangle[i + 1][p - 1]
        p += 1  # Move to the next position for the next iteration
    triangle[level][0] = v  # Assign the calculated value

    # Now we have the leftmost value of the level, calculate the rest of the values
    for i in range(1, level + 1):
        triangle[level][i] = triangle[level - 1][i - 1] - triangle[level][i - 1]

# Write the result to "triunghi.out"
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[n - 1])) + '\n')
```

With this code, we read the input data from `triunghi.in`, initialize the triangle as a list of lists with zero values, and then use the known values to calculate the values for the entire triangle, starting from the known value closest to the tip. We then output the top line of the triangle, which corresponds to `triangle[n - 1]`, to `triunghi.out`.

The error indicates that the code is trying to access an element outside the bounds of the `triangle` list. This suggests that `p` might exceed the number of elements in the `triangle[i + 1]` row. We must ensure that `p` does not go out of bounds when accessing the `triangle` elements.

Let's correct the solution so that we properly handle the reconstruction of the triangle without going out of bounds:

```python
# Read data from "triunghi.in"
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    known_values = []
    for i in range(n):
        p, v = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        known_values.append((p, v))

# Initialize the triangle
triangle = [[0] * (row + 1) for row in range(n)]

# Start from the last known value and work upwards
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    pos, val = known_values[i]
    pos -= 1  # Convert to zero-based index
    level = n - 1 - i  # Compute the level from the bottom

    # Compute the value at the current position
    for j in range(level):
        val -= triangle[level - 1 - j][pos]
        pos += 1
    
    # This is the rightmost element of the current level
    triangle[level][level] = val
    
    # Compute the rest of the elements of the current level
    for j in range(level - 1, -1, -1):
        triangle[level][j] = triangle[level - 1][j] - triangle[level][j + 1]

# Write the result to "triunghi.out"
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[-1])) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution reads the input, initializes the triangle, and starting from the bottom-most known value, it calculates the values above it. This process is repeated for all known values going up the triangle. Finally, the top row of the triangle is written to the output file `triunghi.out`.

The error message indicates an attempt to access an index that is out of the bounds of the `triangle` list. The mistake is likely in the logic that walks back up the triangle to calculate the unknown values from the known ones. We need to be careful with the indices to ensure we don't exceed the bounds of the rows in the triangle.

Let's rewrite the solution to correctly compute the triangle values from the known ones, ensuring that we stay within the bounds of the `triangle` list, and taking into account that the known value can be anywhere in its row:

```python
# Read data from "triunghi.in"
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    known_values = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        p, v = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        known_values[i] = (p - 1, v)  # convert to zero-based index

# Reconstruct the triangle from the known values
triangle = [[0] * (row + 1) for row in range(n)]
for row_index, (p, v) in enumerate(reversed(known_values)):
    # Calculate the difference from the bottom to the row of the known value
    for lower_row in range(n - 1, n - 1 - row_index, -1):
        if p > 0:
            v -= triangle[lower_row][p - 1]
        if p < len(triangle[lower_row]) - 1:
            v -= triangle[lower_row][p]
        p += 1  # Move to the next diagonal cell
    triangle[n - 1 - row_index][0] = v  # Set the leftmost value of the row

    # Calculate the rest of the row using the leftmost value
    for i in range(1, n - row_index):
        triangle[n - 1 - row_index][i] = triangle[n - row_index][i - 1] - triangle[n - 1 - row_index][i - 1]

# Write the result to "triunghi.out"
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[0])) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution uses the known values to calculate the values of the triangle from the bottom up to the top. It ensures that we do not access indices outside the list bounds by checking the index before accessing list elements. The values in the first row of the triangle are then written to 'triunghi.out'.

The error indicates that we are trying to access an element in `triangle[n - row_index]`, which is out of bounds. This is because the `n - row_index` index is invalid when `row_index` is 0 (the last iteration of the loop, representing the top row of the triangle).

Here is the correct solution that iteratively reconstructs the values on each row starting from known values, using the fact that each number is equal to the sum of the two numbers below it.

```python
# Read data from "triunghi.in"
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    known_values = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the triangle with zeros
triangle = [[0] * (i + 1) for i in range(n)]

# Fill the triangle with the known values.
for level, (pos, value) in enumerate(known_values[::-1], 1):
    triangle[-level][pos-1] = value

# Reconstruct the triangle from bottom to top.
for level in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    for index in range(level + 1):
        triangle[level][index] = triangle[level + 1][index] + triangle[level + 1][index + 1]

# Write the result to "triunghi.out"
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[0])) + '\n')
```

This solution reads numbers from `triunghi.in`, initializes a list of lists to represent the triangle, fills in the known values from bottom to top, and calculates the remaining values based on the property of the triangle. Finally, it writes the result to `triunghi.out`.
