Se dă numărul natural $k$. Dorim să obţinem un tablou unidimensional $a$, cu elemente naturale constituite astfel: $a_1 =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_1$ este cifra sutelor produsului $k \cdot k$, iar cifra unităţilor lui $a_1$ este cifra zecilor produsului $k \cdot k$).

Pentru $i > 1$, $a_i$ se obţine astfel: $a_i =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra sutelor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$, iar cifra unităţilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra zecilor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$).

Procesul de generare a termenilor tabloului se încheie în momentul când este generat un număr ce a mai fost generat înainte. Ultimul număr (cel ce se repetă) nu face parte din tablou.

Este posibil ca numerele numite în text ca fiind de “două cifre” să aibă de fapt doar o cifră, în cazul în care cifra zecilor lor este $0$; ele pot fi chiar şi $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care:

1. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut;
2. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut, dar sortate crescător după prima lor cifră (cea mai din stânga).

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găsește $k$.

# Date de ieșire

* Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea generării lor, separate de un spaţiu.
* Pe a doua linie se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea cerută la cerinţa a doua; elementele vor fi separate de câte un spaţiu

# Restricții și precizări

* $11 \leq k \leq 999$;
* La cerinţa a doua: dacă două sau mai multe elemente din tabloul $a$ au aceeaşi primă cifră, atunci aceste elemente se pot afişa în orice ordine ce respectă cerinţa. În exemplul de mai jos, afişarea pentru cerinţa a doua putea fi şi sub forma: $0 \ 2 \ 25 \ 5 \ 62 \ 84$, adică am interschimbat $2$ cu $25$, pentru că ambele au prima cifră $2$ în acest caz, alte posibilităţi de afişare nu mai sunt.
* Pentru prima cerinţă rezolvată corect se atribuie $60\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru a doua, încă $40\%$ din punctaj.

The difference between the expected and found result is in the sorting order of the second line. According to the problem's requirement, elements should be sorted based on their first digit. If elements have the same first digit, their order relative to each other is not specified and can be arbitrary. The initial solution sorted elements first by their tens digit, then by the entire number, which caused elements with the same first digit to be further sorted by their second digit, which is not required.

To fix this, we need to adjust the sorting function to only consider the first digit of each number, allowing elements with the same first digit to remain in the order they appeared in the original sequence.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to extract required digits
def get_digits(number):
    squared = number * number
    tens_digit = (squared // 100) % 10
    ones_digit = (squared // 10) % 10
    return tens_digit * 10 + ones_digit

# Function to generate the sequence and return both ordered and unordered sequences
def generate_sequences(start_value):
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    while start_value not in seen:
        seen.add(start_value)
        sequence.append(start_value)
        start_value = get_digits(start_value)

    # Sort the sequence based on the first digit only
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence[:-1], key=lambda x: x // 10)
    return sequence[:-1], sorted_sequence

# Read the initial value k from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate both sequences
sequence, sorted_sequence = generate_sequences(k)

# Write the sequences to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')
```

This updated solution correctly generates the sequences and sorts them according to the problem's requirements. The last element (the repeating one) is excluded from the sequences before sorting, ensuring it does not appear in the output. The sorted sequence is sorted purely based on the first digit, without considering the second digit for further ordering.

The difference in the results arises from a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements regarding the initial value of `a_1`. According to the problem statement, `a_1` should be obtained using the digits of `k * k`, where the tens digit of `a_1` is the hundreds digit of `k * k`, and the units digit of `a_1` is the tens digit of `k * k`. In my previous solution, I incorrectly included `k` itself as the first element in the sequence, leading to the wrong output.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the initial value `a_1` is calculated correctly from `k * k` before starting the loop to generate the rest of the sequence. We also need to ensure that the sorted sequence maintains the relative order of elements that have the same first digit, as per the problem's instructions.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to extract required digits from the number
def get_digits(number):
    squared = number * number
    tens_digit = (squared // 100) % 10
    ones_digit = (squared // 10) % 10
    return tens_digit * 10 + ones_digit

# Generate the sequence and store the seen numbers to avoid repetition
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    current = get_digits(k)
    while current not in seen:
        seen.add(current)
        sequence.append(current)
        current = get_digits(current)
    return sequence

# Read the initial value k from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the sequence
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write the unsorted and sorted sequences to 'sir.out'
# Sort the sequence based on the first digit only for the second line
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, sequence.index(x))))) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly handle the generation of `a_1` and maintain the relative order of elements with the same first digit when sorting. It writes the unsorted sequence on the first line of 'sir.out' and the sorted sequence on the second line, as required.

The difference between the expected and the found output lies in the sorting function. The requirement is to sort the elements primarily by their first digit and not to further sort them if the first digits are the same. In my previous solution, I attempted to maintain the original order by using `sequence.index(x)` as a secondary key, but this approach did not respect the problem's specification that elements with the same first digit could be in any order relative to each other.

To fix this issue, we will sort the elements solely based on their first digit and ignore their original positions or their second digits. We will create a custom sort function that only considers the first digit of each number.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to extract required digits from the number
def get_digits(number):
    squared = number * number
    tens_digit = (squared // 100) % 10
    ones_digit = (squared // 10) % 10
    return tens_digit * 10 + ones_digit

# Generate the sequence and store the seen numbers to avoid repetition
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    current = get_digits(k)
    while current not in seen:
        seen.add(current)
        sequence.append(current)
        current = get_digits(current)
    return sequence

# Read the initial value k from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the sequence
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Sort the sequence based on the first digit only for the second line
sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10)

# Write the unsorted and sorted sequences to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now produce the correct output according to the problem's specifications. The sequence is written unsorted on the first line and sorted by the first digit only on the second line of 'sir.out'.

The issue with the previous solution is that the sort function needs to consider only the first digit of each number and not the whole number. We should sort the elements in the sequence only by the tens digit (the first digit) and leave the order of elements with the same tens digit unchanged.

The expected output shows that after sorting by the first digit, numbers with a '0' as their tens digit should come first, followed by those that have '2', and so on. The order of numbers with the same first digit remains as they appear in the original sequence.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to extract the two digits from the middle of a squared number
def get_two_middle_digits(n):
    squared = n * n
    return (squared // 100) % 100

# Generate the sequence of numbers and stop when a number repeats
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    current = get_two_middle_digits(k)
    while current not in seen:
        sequence.append(current)
        seen.add(current)
        current = get_two_middle_digits(current)
    return sequence

# Read the initial value k from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the sequence
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write the unsorted sequence to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')

    # Sort the sequence by the first digit (tens place) and write it to 'sir.out'
    # Here we use a stable sort algorithm (like Python's default .sort() or sorted())
    # This ensures that when the first digit is the same, the original order is preserved
    sequence.sort(key=lambda x: x // 10)
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
```

This solution should match the expected output for the given input. It sorts the numbers only based on the tens digit (the first digit) while preserving the relative order of the elements with the same tens digit. This is the correct behavior as specified in the problem statement.

I apologize for the confusion. There was a mistake in the get_two_middle_digits function. The function was intended to capture the two middle digits of the square of the number; however, it incorrectly returned the last two digits when the square was less than 10000, which is the case for numbers less than 100.

Let me correct the function and provide an updated solution:

```python
# Function to extract the two middle digits from the square of a number
def get_two_middle_digits(n):
    squared = n * n
    # Extract hundreds and tens place (two middle digits)
    return (squared % 1000) // 10

# Generate the sequence of numbers and stop when a number repeats
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    current = get_two_middle_digits(k)
    while current not in seen:
        sequence.append(current)
        seen.add(current)
        current = get_two_middle_digits(current)
    return sequence

# Read the initial value k from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the sequence
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write the unsorted sequence to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')

    # Sort the sequence by the first digit (tens place) and write it to 'sir.out'
    # Since we want to maintain the original order for numbers with the same first digit,
    # we perform a stable sort on the tens digit only.
    sequence.sort(key=lambda x: str(x).zfill(2)[0])  # Padding to ensure single digit numbers are sorted correctly
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly capture the middle two digits of the square of a number, generate the sequence, and sort it according to the tens digit, preserving the original order for numbers with the same tens digit. The `zfill(2)` ensures that numbers with less than two digits are treated correctly during the sort.
