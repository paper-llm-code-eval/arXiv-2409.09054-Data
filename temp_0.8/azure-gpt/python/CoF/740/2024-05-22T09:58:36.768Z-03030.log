Se dă numărul natural $k$. Dorim să obţinem un tablou unidimensional $a$, cu elemente naturale constituite astfel: $a_1 =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_1$ este cifra sutelor produsului $k \cdot k$, iar cifra unităţilor lui $a_1$ este cifra zecilor produsului $k \cdot k$).

Pentru $i > 1$, $a_i$ se obţine astfel: $a_i =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra sutelor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$, iar cifra unităţilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra zecilor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$).

Procesul de generare a termenilor tabloului se încheie în momentul când este generat un număr ce a mai fost generat înainte. Ultimul număr (cel ce se repetă) nu face parte din tablou.

Este posibil ca numerele numite în text ca fiind de “două cifre” să aibă de fapt doar o cifră, în cazul în care cifra zecilor lor este $0$; ele pot fi chiar şi $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care:

1. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut;
2. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut, dar sortate crescător după prima lor cifră (cea mai din stânga).

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găsește $k$.

# Date de ieșire

* Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea generării lor, separate de un spaţiu.
* Pe a doua linie se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea cerută la cerinţa a doua; elementele vor fi separate de câte un spaţiu

# Restricții și precizări

* $11 \leq k \leq 999$;
* La cerinţa a doua: dacă două sau mai multe elemente din tabloul $a$ au aceeaşi primă cifră, atunci aceste elemente se pot afişa în orice ordine ce respectă cerinţa. În exemplul de mai jos, afişarea pentru cerinţa a doua putea fi şi sub forma: $0 \ 2 \ 25 \ 5 \ 62 \ 84$, adică am interschimbat $2$ cu $25$, pentru că ambele au prima cifră $2$ în acest caz, alte posibilităţi de afişare nu mai sunt.
* Pentru prima cerinţă rezolvată corect se atribuie $60\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru a doua, încă $40\%$ din punctaj.

Certainly! The error occurred because the `squared[-2]` indexing is incorrect when the `squared` string has a length of 1, which will happen when `num**2` results in a single digit number (0-9). We need to ensure that the indexing works for both single and double-digit numbers. Here's the revised code:

```python
def next_element(num):
    squared = str(num**2)
    if len(squared) >= 3:
        return int(squared[-3:-1])
    elif len(squared) == 2:
        return int(squared)
    else:
        return int(squared) * 10

def write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence):
    with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')

def read_input():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def main():
    k = read_input()
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    a = next_element(k)
    while a not in seen:
        sequence.append(a)
        seen.add(a)
        a = next_element(a)
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x))
    write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Make sure to save the input from `sir.in` and to test whether the output is correctly written to `sir.out`. This revised solution handles the case where the squared result has fewer than two digits and ensures that the slicing does not go out of range. The `seen` set is used to ensure we have a constant-time lookup for already encountered elements to avoid duplicates in the sequence.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is because I made a mistake in the `next_element` function's return value for single-digit squared numbers. When `num**2` is a single digit, the correct behavior is to use `0` as the tens digit and the squared result as the units digit, but the previous code incorrectly multiplied the single digit by `10`.

The logic error is in the line:
```python
return int(squared) * 10
```

It should instead be:
```python
return int(squared)  # This would effectively append a 0 at the end because we are working with two-digit numbers.
```

Let's fix the solution:

```python
def next_element(num):
    squared = str(num**2)
    if len(squared) >= 3:
        return int(squared[-3:-1])
    elif len(squared) == 2:
        return int(squared)
    else:
        return int(squared + '0')  # Append a '0' as the tens digit.

def write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence):
    with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')

def read_input():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def main():
    k = read_input()
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    a = next_element(k)
    while a not in seen:
        sequence.append(a)
        seen.add(a)
        a = next_element(a)
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x))
    write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the corrected `next_element` function, for single-digit squared numbers, we now correctly append a '0' to the result to form a two-digit number with the second digit being 0. This aligns with the requirement that numbers considered to be "two digits" might actually have a single digit plus a leading zero. With this fix, the output should now match the expected result.

Upon reviewing the discrepancy in the output, it seems that my previous solution still has a bug in handling single-digit squares—specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where the single-digit square is `0`. The previous fix did not account for the fact that the square of `0` should result in the two-digit number `00`, not `0`.

Let's fix the `next_element` function to handle this case correctly by ensuring that single-digit squares result in two-digit numbers with a leading zero if necessary.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def next_element(num):
    squared = str(num**2)
    # Ensure we have at least two digits, prepend '0' if necessary
    while len(squared) < 3:
        squared = '0' + squared
    # Return the tens and units place as a two-digit number
    return int(squared[-3:-1])

def write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence):
    with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')

def read_input():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def main():
    k = read_input()
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    a = next_element(k)
    while a not in seen:
        sequence.append(a)
        seen.add(a)
        a = next_element(a)
    # Sort by the first digit, then by the number itself
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x))
    write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This change ensures that for numbers whose square is less than 10 (including 0), we still get a proper two-digit number with a leading zero if necessary. For instance, if `num**2` results in `4`, the `squared` variable will become `'004'`, and the function will return `00` as a two-digit number, which is the intended behavior according to the problem statement. With this fix, the program should now produce the correct output.

The found output's second line is not exactly as expected because the sorting criterion is not fully correct. When sorting by the first digit, in the case of equal first digits, the original numbers should be sorted by their entirety, not by the second digit alone.

The bug is in the lambda function used for sorting:

```python
sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x))
```

This sorts by the first digit and then the entire number, but since we're dealing with two-digit numbers, sorting by the entire number achieves the same effect as sorting by the second digit when the first digits are equal.

To sort correctly by the first digit and then by the second digit only if the first digits are equal, we should use:

```python
sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x % 10))
```

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def next_element(num):
    squared = num ** 2
    return (squared % 1000) // 10  # Extract hundreds and tens digit

def write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence):
    with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')

def read_input():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def main():
    k = read_input()
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    a = next_element(k)
    while a not in seen:
        sequence.append(a)
        seen.add(a)
        a = next_element(a)
    # Sort by the first digit, and then by the second digit if first digits are equal
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x % 10))
    write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With this modification, the second line of the output should match the expected result by sorting the numbers first by their tens digit and then by their ones digit, only if the tens digits are equal. This will ensure that numbers like `25` and `2` are sorted with `2` coming before `25` when the first digits are considered.

The output misalignment is due to the incomplete sorting criteria when sorting by the first digit. We need to ensure that when two numbers have the same first digit, their original order from the sequence is preserved (stable sort). However, sorting by both the tens and units digit (`x // 10`, `x % 10`) doesn't achieve this.

To fix this, we should only sort by the first digit and ensure the sort is stable. Python's `sorted` function is stable, which means it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys. In this case, the key is the first digit of each number.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def next_element(num):
    squared = num ** 2
    # Extract the hundreds and tens digit, considering the edge case for single-digit squares
    return (squared // 10) % 100 if squared > 9 else 0 

def write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence):
    with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')

def read_input():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def main():
    k = read_input()
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    a = next_element(k)
    while a not in seen:
        sequence.append(a)
        seen.add(a)
        a = next_element(a)
    # Sort by the first digit only, ensuring a stable sort
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10)
    write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With this change, the `sorted_sequence` will be sorted correctly by the first digit, preserving the order of the elements as they originally appeared whenever their first digits are the same. This match with the expected behavior and output.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Upon examining the expected output again, the issue is clear. The second line should sort the numbers primarily by the first digit, and if two numbers have the same first digit, they should be sorted by their second digit. Since the previous attempts have not resolved the issue, let's re-implement the solution correctly this time.

We need to fix the sorting criteria to sort by the first digit (tens place) and then by the second digit (ones place) only when the first digits are the same. However, it seems that there was a misunderstanding about how to obtain these digits.

Let's rewrite the solution properly:

```python
def next_element(num):
    squared = num ** 2
    # Get the last three digits and then take the first two
    return (squared % 1000) // 10 

def write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence):
    with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')

def read_input():
    with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
        return int(file.readline().strip())

def main():
    k = read_input()
    sequence = []
    seen = set()
    a = next_element(k)
    while a not in seen:
        sequence.append(a)
        seen.add(a)
        a = next_element(a)
    
    # Sort by the first digit (tens place), and in the case of a tie, by the second digit (ones place)
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x % 10))
    write_output(sequence, sorted_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code should now sort correctly according to the problem statement: it sorts first by the tens digit and then by the units digit if the tens digits are equal. The comparison `(x // 10, x % 10)` ensures that if the first digits (tens place) are the same, the second digits (ones place) will determine the order. This will result in the expected output, where numbers with the same tens digit are sorted by their ones digit.
