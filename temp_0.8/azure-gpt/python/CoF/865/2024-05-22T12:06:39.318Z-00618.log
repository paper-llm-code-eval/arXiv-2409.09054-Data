Alex s-a angajat în vacanța de vară ca barman. Pentru că îi place să transforme munca la bar într-un spectacol, uneori aranjează mai multe pahare identice ca formă și dimensiune, dar de capacități diferite, sub forma unei stive.

~[0.png|align=right|width=30em]
Un pahar din stivă, cu excepția celor de la bază, se sprijină pe exact două pahare din rândul de mai jos. Paharele sunt numerotate ca în imaginea alăturată. Nivelurile din stivă sunt de asemenea numerotate, începând cu $1$, de la vârf, adică paharul $1$ se află pe nivelul $1$, paharele $2$ și $3$ pe nivelul $2$, paharele $4$, $5$ și $6$ sunt pe nivelul $3$, ș.a.m.d.
\
Alex toarnă în fiecare secundă câte un mililitru de apă (o picătură) în paharul numărul $1$. Paharele au o proprietate ciudată atunci când sunt pline: primul mililitru care ajunge într-un pahar plin se va scurge instantaneu în paharul aflat imediat în stânga sa pe rândul de dedesubt, următorul mililitru se va scurge instantaneu în paharul aflat imediat în dreapta sa pe rândul de dedesubt și tot așa, alternativ câte o picătură în cele două pahare.

De exemplu, când paharul $2$ este plin, primul mililitru ce va ajunge în el se va scurge în paharul $4$, următorul mililitru se scurge în paharul $5$, al treilea mililitru se va scurge din nou în paharul $4$, ș.a.m.d.

Atunci când într-un pahar plin aflat la baza stivei ajunge un nou mililitru de apă, acesta se scurge instantaneu pe masă.

# Cerinţă
Cunoscând numărul de pahare din rândul de la baza stivei și faptul că stiva este completă (toate rândurile conțin numărul maxim de pahare ce se pot așeza după regula de mai sus, iar pe cel mai de sus rând se găsește un singur pahar), să se scrie un program care determină:
1. Care este nivelul minim (cel mai de sus) care are suma capacităților tuturor paharelor de pe nivel maximă?
2. Care este numărul minim de secunde necesar pentru a umple toate paharele folosind procedeul descris mai sus și câți mililitri de apă se risipesc (se scurg pe masă) în acest caz?

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `pic.in` se găsește un număr natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.

Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsește un singur număr natural $N$ reprezentând numărul de pahare din rândul de la baza stivei.

Pe a treia linie a fișierului de intrare se găsesc $M = \frac{N \cdot (N+1)}{2}$ numere naturale $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_M$ separate prin câte un spațiu, $C_i$ reprezentând capacitatea (în mililitri) a paharului cu numărul $i$ din stivă.

# Date de ieşire
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire `pic.out` va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al nivelului minim (cel mai de sus) care are suma capacităților tuturor paharelor de pe nivel maximă.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un singur spațiu reprezentând numărul minim de secunde scurse până când toate paharele din stivă sunt pline și respectiv numărul de mililitri de apă risipiți (ajunși pe masă) în acel moment.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $2 \leq N \leq 50$
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 2$.
- $35\%$ din teste vor avea $N \leq 17$, iar $65\%$ din teste vor avea $N > 17$.
- $1 \leq C_i \leq 25$, pentru orice $1 \leq i \leq M$.

```

This solution reads the input file `pic.in` and writes the output to `pic.out`, according to the rules of the challenge. The `fill_glasses` function simulates the process of filling the glasses and calculates the number of seconds and the amount of water spilled. The `find_max_level` function finds the level with the maximum sum of capacities. The solution avoids using `input()` or `print()` and should perform well for the given constraints.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that a process was killed after running out of memory or being terminated by the system. In the context of a Python script, this could be caused by an infinite loop or a memory-intensive operation.

In my initial solution, the `fill_glasses` function has a potential infinite loop due to the way the overflow is handled. If the overflow is not distributed properly to the left and right glasses below, the loop could run indefinitely.

To fix the program, I will modify the `fill_glasses` function to ensure that the overflow is handled correctly. Additionally, I will check for a condition where the overflow does not change, which would mean that the filling process has completed.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def fill_glasses(capacities, N):
    total_capacity = sum(capacities)
    filled = [0] * len(capacities)
    seconds = 0
    while sum(filled) < total_capacity:
        seconds += 1
        i = 0
        overflow = 1
        while overflow:
            filled[i] += overflow
            if filled[i] > capacities[i]:
                overflow = filled[i] - capacities[i]
                filled[i] = capacities[i]
                left = i + (i + 1 - N)
                right = left + 1

                if left < len(capacities):
                    filled[left] += overflow // 2
                if right < len(capacities):
                    filled[right] += overflow - overflow // 2

                overflow = 0
            else:
                overflow = 0
            i += 1
            if i >= len(capacities): break
    spilled = sum(filled) - total_capacity
    return seconds, spilled

# The rest of the code remains unchanged
with open('pic.in', 'r') as file:
    V = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    capacities = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

    for level in range(N):

            level_sums[level] += capacities[index]
            index += 1
    max_sum = max(level_sums)
    return level_sums.index(max_sum) + 1

if V == 1:
    result = find_max_level(capacities, N)

The initial solution didn't properly simulate the process of filling the glasses, especially the way overflow is handled when a glass is full. Additionally, the way the overflow is split between the left and right glasses is incorrect.

To fix the program, we will implement the filling process correctly, ensuring that each time a glass overflows, the water is distributed to the left and right glasses in the level below, alternating between left and right with each additional overflow.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def glass_index(level, pos):
    return (level * (level - 1)) // 2 + pos

def simulate_filling(N, capacities):
    filled = [0] * len(capacities)
    seconds = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(capacities):
        if filled[i] < capacities[i]:
            filled[i] += 1
            seconds += 1
        if filled[i] == capacities[i]:
            level = 1
            while glass_index(level + 1, 1) <= i:
                level += 1
            pos = i - glass_index(level, 1) + 1
            if level == N:
                i += 1
                continue
            next_left = glass_index(level + 1, pos)
            next_right = glass_index(level + 1, pos + 1)
            if seconds % 2 == 1:
                filled[next_left] += 1
            else:
                filled[next_right] += 1
            seconds += 1
        i += 1
    spilled = seconds - sum(capacities)
    return seconds, spilled

def find_max_level_sum(capacities, N):
    sums = [0] * N
    index = 0
    for level in range(N):
        for pos in range(level + 1):
            sums[level] += capacities[index]
            index += 1
    max_sum_level = sums.index(max(sums)) + 1
    return max_sum_level

# Read input data
with open('pic.in', 'r') as file:
    V = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    capacities = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process data
if V == 1:
    answer = find_max_level_sum(capacities, N)
else:
    answer = simulate_filling(N, capacities)

# Write output data
with open('pic.out', 'w') as file:
    if V == 1:
        file.write(f"{answer}\n")
    else:
        file.write(f"{answer[0]} {answer[1]}\n")
```

This solution reads from `pic.in` and writes to `pic.out`. It includes two main functions: `simulate_filling` to calculate the time to fill all glasses and water spilled, and `find_max_level_sum` to find the level with the maximum capacity sum. The `simulate_filling` function has been re-implemented to correctly distribute the water to the next level's glasses, taking into account the alternating left and right pouring when a glass is full. This solution should now produce the expected results.

The error indicates that the program attempted to access an index (`next_right`) that is out of bounds for the `filled` list. This occurs in the `simulate_filling` function, which indicates that the logic to calculate the next right glass index is flawed.

When filling the glasses, the program needs to check whether the current glass is on the last level or whether it is at the end of a row (i.e., a rightmost glass). In such cases, there is no right glass to fill, and the overflow should spill or move to the next row.

Here is the corrected solution that includes proper bounds checking:

```python
def simulate_filling(capacities, N):
    levels = N
    total_glasses = len(capacities)
    filled = [0] * total_glasses
    i = 0
    seconds = 0
    while i < total_glasses:
        seconds += 1
        overflow = True
        index = 0
        while overflow and index < total_glasses:
            if filled[index] < capacities[index]:
                filled[index] += 1
                overflow = False
            else:
                # Determine the left and right child glasses
                level = (index + 1) * 2 - 2
                left_child = index + level
                right_child = left_child + 1
                # Check if children are within bounds (i.e., not spilling)
                # Also ensuring that we do not spill from the last level
                if left_child < total_glasses and right_child < total_glasses:
                    if seconds % 2 == 0:  # Even seconds go to the right glass
                        index = right_child
                    else:  # Odd seconds go to the left glass
                        index = left_child
                else:  # Spill over, we've reached the bottom
                    overflow = False
                    index = total_glasses  # Force exit from while loop
    spilled = seconds - sum(capacities)
    return seconds, spilled

def find_max_level(capacities, N):
    level_sums = [0] * N
    level = 0
    for i, capacity in enumerate(capacities):
        level_sums[level] += capacity
        if i == level * (level + 1) // 2:
            level += 1
    max_sum_level = level_sums.index(max(level_sums)) + 1
    return max_sum_level

# Read input data
with open('pic.in', 'r') as file:
    V = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    capacities = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Compute the answer
if V == 1:
    answer = find_max_level(capacities, N)
else:
    answer = simulate_filling(capacities, N)

# Write output data
with open('pic.out', 'w') as file:
    if V == 1:
        file.write(f"{answer}\n")
    else:
        file.write(f"{answer[0]} {answer[1]}\n")
```

In this fixed solution, `simulate_filling` now correctly handles the bounds of the `filled` list by checking if the left and right child glasses are within the list's range before attempting to fill them. It also distinguishes between cases when the filling process has reached the last level, where any additional water would spill. The `find_max_level` function has been updated to calculate the correct level with the maximum sum of capacities as well.

This solution should handle all edge cases and avoid index out of range errors.

The IndexError in the `find_max_level` function is due to incorrect level calculation. We must calculate the current level based on the index `i` of the glass while iterating through all the glasses. The condition used to increment the level is not correct.

Let's fix the `find_max_level` function by calculating the level correctly, and let's also simplify and correct the logic in the `simulate_filling` function to make sure we are distributing the overflow properly and avoiding index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def simulate_filling(N, capacities):
    filled = [0] * ((N * (N + 1)) // 2)
    total_capacity = sum(capacities)
    seconds = 0
    overflow = False
    while sum(filled) < total_capacity:
        seconds += 1
        i = 0
        extra = 1
        while extra > 0:
            filled[i] += extra
            extra = 0
            if filled[i] > capacities[i]:
                extra = filled[i] - capacities[i]
                filled[i] = capacities[i]
                if i + N < len(filled):
                    if overflow:
                        i += N
                    else:
                        i += N + 1
                overflow = not overflow
            else:
                break
    spilled = sum(filled) - total_capacity
    return seconds, spilled

def find_max_level(N, capacities):
    level_max_capacity = 0
    max_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(N * (N + 1) // 2):
        current_sum += capacities[i]
        level = int(((-1 + (1 + 8 * (i + 1))**0.5) / 2))
        if level != level_max_capacity and current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            level_max_capacity = level
            current_sum = capacities[i]
    if current_sum > max_sum:  # check last level
        level_max_capacity = N
    return level_max_capacity

# Read input data
with open('pic.in', 'r') as file:
    V = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    capacities = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Compute the answer
if V == 1:
    answer = find_max_level(N, capacities)
else:
    answer = simulate_filling(N, capacities)

# Write output data
with open('pic.out', 'w') as file:
    if V == 1:
        file.write(f"{answer}\n")
    else:
        file.write(f"{answer[0]} {answer[1]}\n")
```

This corrected solution uses the quadratic formula to determine the current level of a glass based on its index, which is a more reliable method than trying to increment the level based on the index. In the `simulate_filling` function, the corrected algorithm ensures that the overflow alternates between the left and right glasses properly, and it also avoids accessing out-of-bounds indices by checking if the index is within the length of the `filled` array. This solution should no longer cause an IndexError and should produce the correct output.

Exit code 137 typically indicates a process was terminated by the system, often due to excessive resource usage, such as running out of memory or exceeding a time limit, which could possibly be caused by an infinite loop or inefficient code.

Given that the previous solutions have suffered from logic issues and potential infinite loops, let's implement a new solution that addresses these concerns. The `simulate_filling` function should be carefully reviewed to ensure there is no possibility of an infinite loop and that water overflow is handled correctly.

Here's a new approach for the problem:

```python
def calculate_level(capacity_index):
    # Determines the level of a glass given its index in capacities
    level = 0
    while capacity_index >= 0:
        level += 1
        capacity_index -= level
    return level

def calculate_glass_position(level, capacity_index):
    # Determines the position of a glass within its level
    return capacity_index - (level * (level - 1) // 2)

def simulate_filling(capacities, N):
    # Initialize variables
    glasses_filled = [0] * len(capacities)
    seconds = 0
    spilled = 0
    current_index = 0

    while current_index < len(capacities):
        level = calculate_level(current_index)
        position = calculate_glass_position(level, current_index)
        # Fill the current glass
        if glasses_filled[current_index] < capacities[current_index]:
            glasses_filled[current_index] += 1
            seconds += 1
        # Handle overflow
        if glasses_filled[current_index] > capacities[current_index]:
            overflow = glasses_filled[current_index] - capacities[current_index]
            glasses_filled[current_index] = capacities[current_index]
            # Determine if there are glasses below to receive the overflow
            if level < N:
                left_child = current_index + level

In this new implementation, care has been taken to ensure the filling process moves sequentially through the glasses and handles overflows properly. We fill one glass at a time and, upon overflow, distribute the excess to the next level's glasses if they exist; otherwise, we count it as spilled. We also added functions to calculate the current level and position within the level based on the glass index, which helps in properly identifying left and right children glasses for the overflow. This should prevent any infinite loops or out-of-bounds errors and improve the solution's correctness and efficiency.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the water filling simulation is not handling the overflow correctly. The previous implementation attempted to move the overflow to the children glasses, but it did so in a way that missed the details on how the overflow should alternate between the left and right glasses under each filled glass.

The problem at hand requires a proper simulation of how water is poured into the glass at the top and how it overflows to the lower glasses, one milliliter at a time, alternating between the left and right glasses below. Additionally, it is crucial to simulate the entire process until all the glasses are filled, and to keep track of the water that overflows from the bottom glasses, which is spilled onto the table.

Let's revise the simulate_filling function to correctly implement the simulation:

```python
def simulate_filling(N, capacities):
    # Total number of glasses
    M = (N * (N + 1)) // 2
    
    # Initialize fill levels to 0
    fill_levels = [0] * M
    
    seconds = 0
    spilled = 0
    next_overflow = [0] * M  # to store the next overflow for each glass
    
    while fill_levels[-N:] != capacities[-N:]:  # check if the last row is filled
        glass = 0  # start from the top glass
        water = 1  # one milliliter per second
        seconds += 1
        # Pour water until it overflows or reaches the last row
        while water > 0:
            fill_levels[glass] += water
            if fill_levels[glass] > capacities[glass]:  # overflow
                water = fill_levels[glass] - capacities[glass]
                fill_levels[glass] = capacities[glass]
                
                if glass >= M - N:  # if it is the last row, it spills
                    spilled += water
                    water = 0
                else:  # otherwise, it overflows to the glasses below
                    left_child = glass + (glass + 1) - ((glass + 1) * (glass + 1) - (glass + 1)) // 2
                    right_child = left_child + 1
                    # Alternate the overflow between left and right child glasses
                    next_overflow[left_child] += water // 2
                    next_overflow[right_child] += water - water // 2
                    water = next_overflow[glass]
            else:
                water = 0
            glass += 1
        
        # Prepare for the next second
        for i in range(M):
            next_overflow[i] = 0
            
    return seconds, spilled

# Other functions remain unchanged

# Read input data, compute the answer, and write output data as in previous solutions.
```

We keep track of the current fill level of each glass and handle the overflow correctly. When a glass overflows, we split the overflow evenly to the left and right children for the next second. We repeat this process until the last row is completely filled. The simulation continues to iterate until all glasses are filled, keeping track of any spillage.

Please replace the simulate_filling function in the code with the above implementation, and the rest of the code can remain the same as before. This implementation should provide the correct result for both filling the glasses and finding the maximum level.
