Bunica Marei țese un covor. Mara urmărește cu mare atenție modelul și încearcă să-l reconstituie pe caietul de matematică. Modelul este format din romburi. Primul romb, de indice $1$, are latura formată din două pătrățele, al doilea romb, de indice $2$, are latura formată din trei pătrățele etc. Un romb de indice $i$ are latura formată din $i+1$ pătrățele.

Romburile sunt unite, consecutiv, ca în exemplul din imaginea alăturată. Săgețile indică sensul în care bunica țese covorul. Ca să nu uite modelul, Mara scrie pe caiet, începând cu 1, numere consecutive care să indice modul în care țese bunica covorul. În exemplul următor este reprezentat modul în care se țese un model format din patru romburi.

It seems that the previous solution misinterpreted the pattern in which the rhombs increase. The pattern is not as simple as a sum of arithmetic progression because the number of squares in each subsequent rhomb is not increasing by a constant difference of 1, but rather, the difference itself is increasing by 1 each time. Each rhomb has an increment of 2 units from the previous number of squares, hence the quadratic solution is incorrect.

We need a different approach to calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs and the smallest rhomb index containing the number `k`. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Helper function to calculate the number of squares in complete rhombs
def num_squares_in_rhombs(rhombs_count):
    return rhombs_count * (rhombs_count + 1) * (rhombs_count + 2) // 6

# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs
def calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n):
    rhombs = 0
    # Find the maximum number of complete rhombs by checking the total number
    # of squares required until we exceed `n`
    while num_squares_in_rhombs(rhombs + 1) <= n:
        rhombs += 1
    return rhombs

# Function to find the smallest rhomb index containing the number k
def find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(n, k):
    # Go through each rhomb to find the one that would contain the number k
    total_squares = 0
    rhomb_index = 0
    while total_squares < k:
        rhomb_index += 1
        total_squares += rhomb_index * (rhomb_index + 1) // 2
        if total_squares >= n:
            return 0  # k is not in any complete rhomb
    return rhomb_index

# Read from the input file
with open('covor.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    task = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Compute the result based on the task
if task == 1:
    result = calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n)
else:
    result = find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(n, k)

# Write to the output file
with open('covor.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution first defines a function to calculate the total number of squares in a given number of complete rhombs. It then uses this to find the maximum number of complete rhombs by incrementally checking when the total number of squares exceeds `n`.

For the second task, it iterates through each rhomb, adding the number of squares in each rhomb to a total until it reaches or exceeds `k`. If `k` is reached before exceeding `n`, it returns the current rhomb index; otherwise, it returns 0.

Let's address the issue with the solution. The problem is that the first function `calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n)` calculates the number of complete rhombs incorrectly. We need to consider the pattern identified in the prompt, which describes the number of squares used in each rhomb:

- The first rhomb uses 2 squares.
- The second rhomb uses 3 squares, or (previous + 1).
- The third rhomb uses 5 squares, or (previous + 2).
- The fourth rhomb uses 8 squares, or (previous + 3).

And so on, with each rhomb using one more square than the "previous + current increment" pattern.

For task 1, we need to find the largest integer `x` such that the sum `1 + 2 + ... + x(x + 1)/2` (the sum of the first `x` terms of this pattern) is less than or equal to `n`. 

We will correct the function to use a loop to find the number of complete rhombs by incrementing the count until we can no longer add a complete rhomb without exceeding `n`.

For task 2, we need to find the smallest rhomb index that contains the number `k`. We iterate through the rhombs, summing the number of squares each rhomb uses until we find the rhomb that contains `k`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the total number of squares in a given number of rhombs
def squares_in_rhombs(rhombs_count):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, rhombs_count + 1):
        total += i + 1
    return total

# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs
def calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n):
    rhombs_count, total_squares = 0, 0
    while True:
        needed_squares = rhombs_count + 2
        if total_squares + needed_squares > n:
            break
        total_squares += needed_squares
        rhombs_count += 1
    return rhombs_count

# Function to find the smallest rhomb index containing the number k
def find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k):
    rhomb_index, total_squares_previous = 0, 0
    while total_squares_previous < k:
        rhomb_index += 1
        total_squares_current = squares_in_rhombs(rhomb_index)
        if total_squares_current >= k:
            return rhomb_index
        total_squares_previous = total_squares_current
    return 0

# Read from the input file
with open('covor.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    task = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Compute the result based on the task
result = calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n) if task == 1 else find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k)

# Write to the output file
with open('covor.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly output the number of complete rhombs that can be formed (4 in the given example) and the smallest rhomb index that contains the number `k`.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's re-evaluate the problem and rewrite the correct algorithm.

For Task 1:

- We know that the first rhomb has 2 squares, the second has 3 squares, the third has 5 squares, and so on, with each new rhomb having a number of squares equal to the previous rhomb's squares plus an incrementing number (starting from 1).
- We can calculate the total number of squares used by $x$ rhombs as $2 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2 + (x-1)) = x^2 + x$.
- We need to find the maximum $x$ such that $x^2 + x \leq n$.

For Task 2:

- We must find the smallest $i$ such that the total number of squares up to (and including) the $i$-th rhomb is at least $k$.
- The total number of squares up to the $i$-th rhomb is given by $i^2 + i$.
- We need to find the smallest $i$ such that $i^2 + i \geq k$.

Let's correct the solution by implementing new logic for both tasks:

```python
# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs
def calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n):
    # Binary search for the maximum x where x^2 + x <= n
    left, right = 0, n
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if mid * mid + mid <= n:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return left

# Function to find the smallest rhomb index containing the number k
def find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k):
    # Binary search for the minimum i where i^2 + i >= k
    left, right = 0, k
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid * mid + mid < k:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

# Read from the input file
with open('covor.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    task = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Compute the result based on the task
if task == 1:
    result = calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n)
else:
    result = find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k)

# Write to the output file
with open('covor.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution should now provide the expected results for the given tasks. It calculates the total number of rhombs that can be completely formed within a sequence of `n` numbers and finds the smallest rhomb index that contains the number `k` using binary searches which are efficient for the given constraints.

Let's address the issue with the solution. The problem comes from the incorrect calculation of the maximum number of complete rhombs that can be formed within a sequence of `n` numbers.

Let's reevaluate the pattern that is forming here: each rhomb after the first one adds an increasing number of squares based on its index. The first rhomb has 2 squares, the second has 2 + 2, the third has 3 + 3, and so on. The pattern suggests that the number of squares for the `i-th` rhomb is `i + 1`.

So, the total number of squares up to the `i-th` rhomb is the sum `2 + (2 + 2) + (3 + 3) + ... + (i + i)`. This sum can be rewritten as `2 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + i)` since the first term is a single 2. The expression `(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + i)` is the sum of the first `i` natural numbers, so it can be simplified to `(i * (i + 1)) / 2`. Thus, the total number of squares is `i * (i + 1)`.

Let's rewrite the function to calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs by finding the largest `i` such that `i * (i + 1) <= n`.

For the second task, we need to find the smallest `i` such that the total number of squares up to the `i-th` rhomb is greater than or equal to `k`. This is equivalent to finding the smallest `i` such that `i * (i + 1) >= k`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs
def calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n):
    i = 1
    while i * (i + 1) <= n:
        i += 1
    return i - 1

# Function to find the smallest rhomb index containing the number k
def find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k):
    i = 1
    while i * (i + 1) < k:
        i += 1
    return i

# Read from the input file
with open('covor.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    task = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Compute the result based on the task
if task == 1:
    result = calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n)
else:
    # If k is greater than the number of squares that can be formed with n squares,
    # then we cannot find such a rhomb and should return 0.
    result = 0 if k > n else find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k)

# Write to the output file
with open('covor.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly output the number of complete rhombs that can be formed with a given `n` squares (4 for the given input), and the smallest rhomb index that contains the number `k`.

Allow me to correct the issue. After examining the problem more closely, I realized that the sequence of the total number of squares that each rhomb contains is given by the triangular numbers, incremented by one. For the first rhomb, the total is 2 (1 + 1), then 4, 7, 11, 16, etc. These totals can be represented by the formula `i * (i + 1) / 2 + i`, which simplifies to `(i * (i + 3)) / 2`.

### For Task 1:
We need to find the largest integer `i` such that `(i * (i + 3)) / 2` is less than or equal to `n`.

### For Task 2:
We need to find the smallest integer `i` such that `(i * (i + 3)) / 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.

We can use a direct approach to iterate and find these values.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the total number of squares used by the first `i` rhombs
def total_squares(i):
    return (i * (i + 3)) // 2

# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs
def calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n):
    i = 0
    # Find the i that maximizes the number of complete rhombs without exceeding n
    while total_squares(i + 1) <= n:
        i += 1
    return i

# Function to find the smallest rhomb index containing the number k
def find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k):
    i = 1
    # Find the smallest i such that the total number of squares is at least k
    while total_squares(i) < k:
        i += 1
    return i

# Read from the input file
with open('covor.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    task = int(fin.readline().strip())

# Compute the result based on the task
if task == 1:
    result = calculate_max_complete_rhombs(n)
else:
    result = find_smallest_rhomb_containing_k(k) if total_squares(n) >= k else 0

# Write to the output file
with open('covor.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should accurately calculate the maximum number of complete rhombs that can be formed from up to `n` numbers and determine which rhomb contains the number `k`. It iterates through the sequence until it finds the correct `i` that satisfies the conditions for each respective task.
