Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it appears that the dynamic programming approach has not been correctly implemented. The initialization of the `dp` table and the transition conditions need to be fixed to properly handle the given constraints and restrictions.

Let's address the issues:

1. The original implementation did not correctly initialize the `dp` table for the first story. It should allow the zmeu to have any possible remaining number of heads after the first story, not just `n - stories[0][1]`.

2. The approach to check the restrictions appears to be incorrect. The code snippet is treating the `restrictions` as a list of successors, but the problem statement indicates that certain stories cannot follow others, which suggests that we should consider these restrictions while building the possible transitions between stories.

To fix the issues and rewrite the solution, I will re-implement the dynamic programming algorithm with correct initialization and transition logic.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from zmeu.in
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the dynamic programming table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]

# Create a list of stories that can follow the current story
follows = {i: set(range(1, p + 1)) for i in range(1, p + 1)}
for a, b in restrictions:
    follows[a].discard(b)

# Dynamic programming to find the minimum duration
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if dp[i][j] != float('inf'):
            for succ in follows[i]:
                heads_lost = stories[succ][1]
                if j - heads_lost >= 0:
                    dp[succ][j - heads_lost] = min(dp[succ][j - heads_lost], dp[i][j] + stories[succ][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:])

# Write the output data to zmeu.out
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_duration if min_duration != float("inf") else -1}\n')
```

This solution initializes the `dp` table correctly for the first story and takes into account all the possible follow-up stories while avoiding those that are restricted. It also properly searches for the minimum duration path that allows the zmeu to survive with at least one head by the end of the last story.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not properly take into account the fact that the zmeu must end with story `p`, and it incorrectly computes the minimum duration. Specifically, it does not ensure that the zmeu ends with the final story while still having at least one head remaining.

In this corrected approach, I will implement a dynamic programming solution that carefully handles the constraints and the requirements of ending with the last story `p`. Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Read the input data from zmeu.in
with open('zmeu.in') as fin:
    n, p, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Create a dictionary to hold the restrictions
cannot_follow = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
for a, b in restrictions:
    cannot_follow[b - 1].add(a - 1)

# Initialize the dynamic programming table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0] # Starting with story 1

# Perform dynamic programming
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        for prev in range(i):
            if dp[prev][j] != float('inf') and prev not in cannot_follow[i]:
                heads_left = j - stories[i][1]
                if heads_left >= 0:
                    dp[i][heads_left] = min(dp[i][heads_left], dp[prev][j] + stories[i][0])

# Calculate the minimum total duration
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1])

# Write the output data to zmeu.out
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as fout:
    if min_duration == float('inf'):
        fout.write('-1\n')
    else:
        fout.write(f'{min_duration}\n')
```

This solution correctly initializes the `dp` table and checks all possible previous stories that the current story can follow, excluding those that are restricted. It keeps track of the number of heads after each story and updates the minimum duration accordingly. Finally, it computes the minimum duration to reach the last story, `p`, while still having at least one head remaining, which is required for a valid sequence of stories. If no valid sequence is found, it writes `-1` to `zmeu.out`.

The issue with the previous solution arises from the dynamic programming transition logic. The solution does not properly handle the sequence of stories due to the given constraints. Specifically, the logic for processing the restrictions is flawed, and the way of updating the DP table does not correctly find the minimum duration that ends with the last story while having at least one head remaining.

To fix the issues and ensure correctness, let's revise the problem:

1. We should initialize the DP table to represent the initial state after the first story.
2. The DP table should store the minimum duration for each possible number of remaining heads after each story.
3. We need to process the stories in order and enforce restrictions correctly—only considering transitions from stories that are not restricted to precede the current one and updating the state only if the number of heads is enough to survive the current story.
4. The final answer will be the minimum duration across all possible states with at least one head remaining after the last story.

Here's a rewritten and corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from zmeu.in
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
    for _ in range(k):
        prev, next = map(int, file.readline().split())
        restrictions[next].append(prev)

# Initialize the dynamic programming table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum duration to tell the first i stories with j heads left
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
for heads_left in range(n - stories[1][1] + 1):
    dp[1][heads_left] = stories[1][0]

# Fill the dynamic programming table
for i in range(2, p + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        # Calculate the number of heads left after telling the ith story
        heads_left = j - stories[i][1]
        # If there are heads left, update the dp table
        if heads_left >= 0:
            # Consider all previous stories that are not restricted and transition to the current story
            for prev_story in range(1, i):
                if prev_story not in restrictions[i] and dp[prev_story][j] != float('inf'):
                    dp[i][heads_left] = min(dp[i][heads_left], dp[prev_story][j] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story (p) among all possible heads left
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:])

# Write the output data to zmeu.out
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{-1 if min_duration == float("inf") else min_duration}\n')
```

The corrected solution ensures that we only consider valid transitions between stories, taking into account the restrictions, and then find the minimum duration to complete all stories with at least one head remaining. If there's no way to finish the stories with at least one head, the solution will output `-1`.

Upon carefully reviewing the problem and the previous attempts, it's clear that the dynamic programming (DP) approach needs to correctly handle the story sequence order and the restrictions between the stories. The previous solutions failed to do so, leading to incorrect results.

Let's address the issues and rewrite the solution:

1. We should use a DP approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum total duration to tell the sequence of stories up to and including story `i`, with exactly `j` heads remaining. We must start from story `1` and end with story `p`.
2. We must consider all possible previous stories that can precede the current story `i`, given the restrictions, and choose the one that results in the minimum total duration.
3. We need to ensure that we do not violate the head count constraint: A sequence of stories is valid if and only if the zmeu has at least one head remaining at the end.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from zmeu.in
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [None] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    forbidden_follow_ups = [set() for _ in range(p + 1)]
    for _ in range(k):
        a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
        forbidden_follow_ups[b].add(a)

# Initialize the dynamic programming table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]  # Start with story 1

# Fill the dynamic programming table
for i in range(2, p + 1):
    for prev in range(1, i):
        if i not in forbidden_follow_ups[prev]:  # Check if the story can follow the previous one
            for heads in range(n + 1):
                if heads + stories[i][1] <= n:  # Ensure we do not exceed the total number of heads
                    dp[i][heads] = min(dp[i][heads], dp[prev][heads + stories[i][1]] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:])

# Write the output data to zmeu.out
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_duration == float('inf'):
        file.write('-1\n')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_duration}\n')
```

In this corrected solution, we properly initialize the DP table to account for the number of heads after the first story. We then iterate over each story, and for each possible head count, we determine the minimum duration while adhering to the restrictions. Finally, we look at the DP table's last story entry and find the minimum total duration with at least one head remaining. If no valid sequence is found, we output `-1`.

It seems I misunderstood the problem in the previous attempts. The issue arises from not handling the restrictions correctly. Upon reading the problem statement again, I realize that the restrictions state that we cannot tell the story `p_j` if we have already told the story `p_i`. Therefore, the restrictions specify a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the edges point from `p_i` to `p_j`, indicating `p_i` cannot be told before `p_j`.

Let's try a different approach. We need to create a graph representing the stories and their restrictions. Then, we should perform a topological sort on this graph so that we can process the stories in a linear order that respects the restrictions. For the DP state, we will use `dp[i][j]` to represent the minimum duration to reach story `i` with `j` heads remaining.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input data from zmeu.in
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    graph = [[] for _ in range(p + 1)]
    in_degree = [0] * (p + 1)
    for _ in range(k):
        a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
        graph[a].append(b)
        in_degree[b] += 1

# Perform topological sort
queue = deque([1])
order = []
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    order.append(node)
    for neigh in graph[node]:
        in_degree[neigh] -= 1
        if in_degree[neigh] == 0:
            queue.append(neigh)

# Initialize the dynamic programming table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]

# Fill the dynamic programming table following the topological order
for i in order[1:]:
    for heads_left in range(n + 1):
        for prev in graph[i]:
            if heads_left + stories[i][1] <= n and dp[prev][heads_left] != float('inf'):
                dp[i][heads_left] = min(dp[i][heads_left], dp[prev][heads_left + stories[i][1]] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:])

# Write the output data to zmeu.out
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_duration == float('inf'):
        file.write('-1\n')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_duration}\n')
```

This solution first constructs a graph of stories with directed edges representing the restrictions. It then performs a topological sort to find a valid order to process the stories. With this order, it fills the DP table from the starting story to the last one, considering the restrictions. Finally, it finds the minimum total duration to finish the last story with at least one head remaining and writes this to the output file. If no valid sequence exists, it outputs `-1`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there is a flaw in the way the dynamic programming table is being updated or in the way the restrictions are being handled. Upon closer inspection, the error is likely due to the fact that we are attempting to compute the `dp` table following the topological order, but we're not correctly handling the edges of the graph that represent restrictions. Moreover, the topological sort might not be necessary if we handle the restrictions directly in the DP computation.

Let's reimplement the solution without an explicit topological sort and instead enforce the restrictions directly during the DP update process. We want to update the DP table only if the story `i` can be told after story `prev` according to the restrictions.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from zmeu.in
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    cannot_follow = {i: [] for i in range(p + 1)}
    for _ in range(k):
        a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
        cannot_follow[b].append(a)

# Initialize the dynamic programming table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]  # Start with story 1

# Fill the dynamic programming table
for i in range(2, p + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        # Check all possible previous stories
        for prev in range(1, i):
            if i not in cannot_follow[prev] and j + stories[i][1] <= n:
                # Update dp array if the current story can follow the previous one
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[prev][j + stories[i][1]] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:])

# Write the output data to zmeu.out
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_duration if min_duration != float("inf") else -1}\n')
```

This solution initializes the DP table for the first story and then iterates through each story. For each story `i`, it considers all possible previous stories `prev` that do not have a restriction preventing `i` from following `prev`. If the current story can follow the previous one and does not result in a negative number of heads, it updates the DP table with the minimum duration. Finally, it finds the minimum total duration required to reach the last story with at least one head remaining and outputs the result. If no such sequence exists, it outputs `-1`.
