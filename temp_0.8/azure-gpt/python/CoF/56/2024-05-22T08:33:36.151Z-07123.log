Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, k, stories, constraints

def write_result(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, constraints):
    # Create a directed graph with stories and constraints
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
    for pre, post in constraints:
        graph[pre].append(post)
    
    # Initialize DP table with infinite duration and set the first story's duration
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

    # Breadth-first search to find the minimum duration path
    queue = deque([(1, n - stories[0][1])])
    while queue:
        story, heads = queue.popleft()
        for next_story in graph[story]:
            next_heads = heads - stories[next_story - 1][1]
            if next_heads < 0:  # Skip if no heads are left
                continue
            next_duration = dp[story][heads] + stories[next_story - 1][0]
            if next_duration < dp[next_story][next_heads]:
                dp[next_story][next_heads] = next_duration
                queue.append((next_story, next_heads))

    # Get the minimum duration that ends with the last story

# Main execution
n, p, k, stories, constraints = read_data('zmeu.in')
result = find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, constraints)

This Python script reads the input data, processes it to find the minimum duration for the zmeu to complete his journey, and writes the output to the specified output file. The solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum duration of the stories sequence that satisfies the constraints and ends with at least one head remaining. The script should be executed on the system with the `zmeu.in` file in the same directory for it to read the input correctly.

Certainly, let's evaluate the differences between the expected and found results and rewrite the solution with necessary fixes.

Upon reviewing the previously provided solution, we notice that it attempts to create a directed graph and perform a breadth-first search to find the shortest path. However, it incorrectly initializes the DP (dynamic programming) table and it might not correctly evaluate all possible paths due to the constraint processing. It also seems to have a problem where it does not correctly deal with the 'next story' index.

Let's fix the solution by rewriting it with the following changes:
1. Initialize the DP table to store the minimum duration to reach the last story with a given number of heads remaining.
2. Implement a topological sort to ensure that we process the stories in a valid order.
3. Correctly update the DP table, considering the constraints.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def topological_sort(graph, indegree, p):
    # Perform topological sort on the graph
    sorted_order = []
    queue = deque([1])  # Start with the first story
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        sorted_order.append(node)
        
        for next_node in graph[node]:
            indegree[next_node] -= 1
            if indegree[next_node] == 0:
                queue.append(next_node)
    
    return sorted_order

def find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, constraints):
    # Create a graph and indegree map
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegree = defaultdict(int)

    for pre, post in constraints:
        graph[pre].append(post)
        indegree[post] += 1

    # Perform topological sort of the stories
    sorted_stories = topological_sort(graph, indegree, p)
    
    # Initialize DP array
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Start with the first story
    
    # Dynamic programming to find minimum duration
    for story in sorted_stories:
        for heads in range(n, -1, -1):
            if dp[story][heads] != float('inf'):
                for next_story in graph[story]:
                    next_heads = heads - stories[next_story - 1][1]
                    if next_heads >= 0:
                        dp[next_story][next_heads] = min(dp[next_story][next_heads], dp[story][heads] + stories[next_story - 1][0])
    
    # Get the minimum duration for the last story with any number of heads
    min_duration = min(dp[p])
    return min_duration if min_duration != float('inf') else -1

def main():
    # Read data from file
    with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as f:
        n, p, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        constraints = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    
    # Find minimum duration
    result = find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, constraints)

    # Write result to file
    with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Execute the program
main()
```

This rewritten solution uses a topological sort to ensure that we visit each story in an order that respects the constraints. We then update the DP table based on this order to find the minimum duration. The output should now match the expected result for the given input.

After reviewing the code and the expected output, the primary issue seems to lie in the handling of constraints and the dynamic programming implementation. The constraints are not simply a case of one story not being able to proceed another; they are actually mutual exclusive pairs. So the graph approach to manage constraints might not be suitable. Instead, we should directly apply these constraints when calculating the DP states.

Here's a revised solution that uses a different approach to handle the sequence of stories and constraints:

```python
def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        forbidden_pairs = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, stories, forbidden_pairs

def write_result(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def find_min_duration(n, p, stories, forbidden_pairs):
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

    # Convert forbidden pairs into a set for faster look-up
    forbidden_set = set(forbidden_pairs)

    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, p):
        for heads in range(n + 1):
            if dp[i - 1][heads] != float('inf'):
                # Check for each next story if it's not forbidden
                for j in range(i, p):
                    if (i, j + 1) not in forbidden_set and (j + 1, i) not in forbidden_set:
                        next_heads = heads - stories[j][1]
                        if next_heads >= 0:
                            dp[j][next_heads] = min(dp[j][next_heads], dp[i - 1][heads] + stories[j][0])

    # Find minimum duration for the last story
    min_duration_last = min(dp[p - 1])
    return min_duration_last if min_duration_last != float('inf') else -1

# Main execution
n, p, stories, forbidden_pairs = read_data('zmeu.in')
result = find_min_duration(n, p, stories, forbidden_pairs)
write_result('zmeu.out', result)
```

This solution reads the input file to get the initial number of heads, the number of stories, the duration and heads lost for each story, and the list of forbidden pairs of stories. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate, for every story and number of remaining heads, the minimum duration to reach that state. The final result is the minimum of the last row of the DP table, representing the last story. If there's no feasible solution, the result is -1.

Please note that this solution assumes that the constraints given in the 'forbidden_pairs' are mutual exclusions and not just a directed constraint as the previous solution assumed.

The differences in the output suggest that the dynamic programming approach might be overlooking the constraints or not correctly accumulating the durations. 

In the previous code, the DP table was not properly updated due to an incorrect index shift in the story iteration. Also, the iteration through future stories without ensuring that they come after the current story is a problem.

Here's the corrected and rewritten solution with a proper dynamic programming approach. We'll compute the minimum total duration for reaching each story with a specific number of heads left, using only valid transitions according to the constraints.

```python
def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        durations_heads = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, durations_heads, restrictions

def write_result(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def find_min_duration(n, p, durations_heads, restrictions):
    # Initialize DP table with None values, except for the first story
    dp = [[None] * (n+1) for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - durations_heads[0][1]] = durations_heads[0][0]  # Starting story

    # Convert restrictions into a set of forbidden next stories for each story
    forbidden_next = {i: set() for i in range(1, p+1)}
    for i, j in restrictions:
        forbidden_next[i].add(j)

    # Dynamic programming to fill the table
    for i in range(p-1):
        for heads in range(n+1):
            if dp[i][heads] is not None:
                for j in range(i+1, p):
                    if j+1 not in forbidden_next[i+1]:  # Skip forbidden stories
                        duration, cut_heads = durations_heads[j]
                        next_heads = heads - cut_heads
                        # Check if this story can be included by not losing all heads
                        if next_heads >= 0:
                            if dp[j][next_heads] is None or dp[j][next_heads] > dp[i][heads] + duration:
                                dp[j][next_heads] = dp[i][heads] + duration

    # The result is the minimum duration to end at the last story with any heads left
    min_duration = min(filter(None, dp[p-1]))
    return -1 if min_duration is None else min_duration

# Main execution
n, p, durations_heads, restrictions = read_data('zmeu.in')
result = find_min_duration(n, p, durations_heads, restrictions)
write_result('zmeu.out', result)
```

This solution should now properly consider all constraints and only allow transitions between stories that are not forbidden. It finds the minimum total duration to reach the last story with any number of heads left. If no such path exists, it returns -1.

The discrepancies between the expected and found results suggest that we are not correctly enforcing the restrictions on the stories' order or we're not accumulating the heads and durations correctly.

In the provided input example, the story flow should be 1 -> 2 -> 4, because story 3 cannot follow story 2 due to the restrictions provided. The expected minimum total duration is obtained by adding the durations of these stories (2 + 4 + 3 = 9), provided that the total heads lost do not exceed the initial number of heads (10 - 6 for story 1 - 0 for story 2 - 3 for story 4 = 1).

Let's fix the solution by correctly handling the restrictions and the dynamic programming states:

```python
def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename) as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, stories, restrictions

def write_result(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def find_min_duration(n, p, stories, restrictions):
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Start with the first story

    # Convert restrictions into a forward lookup table
    forbidden_followers = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
    for a, b in restrictions:
        forbidden_followers[a-1].add(b-1)

    # Build the DP table
    for i in range(p - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, p):
            if j in forbidden_followers[i]:
                continue
            for heads in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if heads >= stories[j][1] and dp[heads - stories[j][1]] != float('inf'):
                    dp[heads] = min(dp[heads], dp[heads - stories[j][1]] + stories[j][0])

    # Check if the last story can be reached with at least one head
    min_duration = min(dp[1:])
    return -1 if min_duration == float('inf') else min_duration

# Main execution
n, p, stories, restrictions = read_data('zmeu.in')
result = find_min_duration(n, p, stories, restrictions)
write_result('zmeu.out', result)
```

This solution initializes a DP list `dp` with lengths up to the total number of heads `n`. It starts with the first story and iterates through the stories, updating the minimum duration for each possible number of remaining heads. It respects the restrictions by skipping any story that is forbidden to follow another. The final result is the minimum duration for the last story while having at least one head left. If no such path exists that satisfies the conditions, it returns -1.

It seems the previous implementations did not correctly handle the constraints or properly update the dynamic programming (DP) states. To correct these issues, we need to ensure that:

1. We start from the first story and end at the last story.
2. We respect the constraints that dictate the order of stories.
3. We minimize the total duration while ensuring the zmeu maintains at least one head.

The main challenge is to consider these constraints while also finding the minimum duration. The following implementation will address these concerns with a correct DP approach:

```python
def find_min_duration(n, p, stories, constraints):
    # Initialize DP table
    # dp[i][j] will represent the minimum duration to reach story i with j heads left
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # start from the first story

    # Build a lookup for constraints to quickly check if a story can follow another
    cannot_follow = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
    for before, after in constraints:
        cannot_follow[after - 1].add(before - 1)

    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(p):  # current story
        for j in range(n + 1):  # current heads left
            if dp[i][j] == float('inf'):  # skip if this state is not reachable
                continue
            for k in range(i + 1, p):  # next story
                if i in cannot_follow[k]:  # skip if the next story cannot follow the current one
                    continue
                heads_left_after = j - stories[k][1]  # heads left after next story
                if heads_left_after >= 0:  # check if the zmeu survives
                    dp[k][heads_left_after] = min(dp[k][heads_left_after], dp[i][j] + stories[k][0])

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story with any heads left
    min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])
    return -1 if min_duration == float('inf') else min_duration

# Read the input data from file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Find the result
result = find_min_duration(n, p, stories, constraints)

# Write the output data to file
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This implementation uses a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum duration to reach the `i-th` story with `j` heads left. The constraints are enforced by skipping over any transitions that are not allowed due to the story order restrictions. The minimum duration for the last story must be found by looking at any positive number of heads left. If we cannot reach the last story with one or more heads, we return `-1`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the dynamic programming solution is not handling the constraints correctly. Upon examining the code, it appears that the DP state transitions are not correctly accounting for the constraints, and the minimum duration calculation is not being accurately updated to reflect the order of the stories.

To fix the solution, we need to ensure that we correctly apply these constraints when determining the valid story sequences. We should revise the dynamic programming approach to also consider the restrictions on the order of the stories.

Here's the revised solution, applying the necessary fixes:

```python
def solve(n, p, stories, constraints):
    # Initialize DP table
    # dp[i][j] will hold the minimum duration to tell i stories with j heads remaining
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Starting with the first story

    # Convert constraints to adjacency list for next story constraints
    next_story_constraints = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
    for constraint in constraints:
        next_story_constraints[constraint[0]].append(constraint[1])

In this solution, the `dp` table is now correctly representing the state after considering each story. The `solve` function iterates over the stories and updates the DP table with the minimum duration to reach each story with a certain number of heads left, considering the constraints. The `min_duration` is then the minimum value in the last row of the DP table for the last story where there is at least one head left (excluding the initial column representing no heads left). If no solution is possible that meets all constraints and keeps at least one head, the result is `-1`.
