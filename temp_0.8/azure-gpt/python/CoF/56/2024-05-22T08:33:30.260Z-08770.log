Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

This solution implements a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum duration sequence of stories that keeps at least one head of the Zmeu. The `dp` table keeps track of the minimum duration to reach each story with a given number of heads left. Transitions between stories are allowed if they respect the order restrictions. The answer is the minimum duration found for the last story considering any number of remaining heads. If no valid sequence is found, the function writes `-1` to the output file.

Upon reviewing the previous solution, it appears there is a mistake in the dynamic programming state transition logic. The previous solution does not properly handle the restrictions on story sequencing, and it does not appropriately accumulate the total duration while ensuring the zmeu survives with at least one head.

Let me first explain the optimal strategy for this problem:

1. Use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum duration to reach each story.
2. The `dp` state should consider the current story and the number of heads remaining.
3. The transition should only occur if the next story does not violate the restrictions and leaves the zmeu with at least one head.
4. To correctly handle the restrictions, we should only consider transitioning from stories that can precede the current one.
5. If no valid sequence is found, we should output -1.

I will now rewrite the solution to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def solve_zmeu_problem(in_filename, out_filename):
    with open(in_filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [(0, 0)]
        for _ in range(p):
            stories.append(tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())))
        restrictions = defaultdict(list)
        for _ in range(k):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[b].append(a)

    # Initialize DP table with None
    dp = [[None] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]  # Starting story

    # Dynamic programming to fill the table
    for i in range(2, p + 1):  # For each story
        for j in range(n + 1):  # For each head count
            # Check previous stories for possible transitions
            min_duration = float('inf')
            for prev_story in range(1, i):
                if i not in restrictions[prev_story] and dp[prev_story][j] is not None:
                    heads_left = j - stories[i][1]
                    if heads_left >= 0:  # Zmeu survives
                        min_duration = min(min_duration, dp[prev_story][j] + stories[i][0])
            if min_duration != float('inf'):
                dp[i][j] = min_duration

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story that leaves the zmeu alive
    result = min(filter(lambda x: x is not None, dp[p]))

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open(out_filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result if result is not None else -1))

solve_zmeu_problem('zmeu.in', 'zmeu.out')
```

This corrected solution properly initializes the DP table and fills it by considering only valid transitions as per the restrictions. It also ensures that the zmeu remains alive with at least one head after each story. The result is the minimum value found in the last row of the DP table (corresponding to the last story) that is not `None`, indicating a valid and minimum duration sequence was found. If no sequence was found, the result is `-1`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to a flaw in the dynamic programming (DP) transition logic. The previous solution incorrectly allows direct transitions without enforcing the restrictions on story sequencing and does not handle the updates in the DP table to ensure the minimum duration is calculated correctly.

Let's re-implement the solution with the following considerations:

1. We will maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum duration to reach story `i` with `j` heads left.
2. We will enforce the restrictions correctly, ensuring that we only transition from stories that can be told before the current one.
3. After considering all possible previous stories for a given story, if we have not found a valid transition, we will mark it as unreachable for that number of heads left.
4. We will take the minimum duration over all head counts that leave at least one head at the last story.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def solve_zmeu_problem(in_filename, out_filename):
    with open(in_filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = defaultdict(list)
        for _ in range(k):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[b].append(a)
    
    # dp[i][j] will hold the minimum duration to reach story i with j heads left
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]  # Start with the first story

    for i in range(2, p + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if j - stories[i][1] >= 0:  # Zmeu must survive
                for prev in range(1, i):
                    if i not in restrictions[prev] and j - stories[i][1] >= 0:
                        dp[i][j - stories[i][1]] = min(dp[i][j - stories[i][1]], dp[prev][j] + stories[i][0])
    
    result = min(dp[p][1:])  # Ignore the case with 0 heads left
    
    with open(out_filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write('-1\n' if result == float('inf') else f'{result}\n')

solve_zmeu_problem('zmeu.in', 'zmeu.out')
```

This solution should now correctly process the restrictions and calculate the minimum duration while ensuring that the Zmeu finishes with at least one head. The output will be written to `zmeu.out` as expected.

The exit code 1 and the error message indicate that there is a `NameError` because `defaultdict` is not defined. The `defaultdict` class is part of the `collections` module in Python, and it seems I forgot to import it at the beginning of the script.

To fix this issue, I need to add the following import statement at the start of the script:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
```

Here is the corrected solution including the necessary import:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def solve_zmeu_problem(in_filename, out_filename):
    with open(in_filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = defaultdict(list)
        for _ in range(k):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[a].append(b)
    
    # Initialize DP table with infinity
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]  # Start with the first story

    # Fill in the DP table
    for i in range(2, p + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if j >= stories[i][1]:  # Zmeu must survive
                for prev in range(1, i):
                    if i not in restrictions[prev] and dp[prev][j] != float('inf'):
                        dp[i][j - stories[i][1]] = min(dp[i][j - stories[i][1]], dp[prev][j] + stories[i][0])
    
    # Find minimum duration for the last story with heads left
    result = min(dp[p][1:])  # Ignore the case with 0 heads left
    
    # Write the result to the output file
    with open(out_filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write('-1' if result == float('inf') else f'{result}')

solve_zmeu_problem('zmeu.in', 'zmeu.out')
```

Now, the script should run without errors, and the `solve_zmeu_problem` function will write the correct result to `zmeu.out` as intended.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output indicates that there is still an error in the implementation of the dynamic programming solution. The error seems to be in how the transitions are being handled and how the restrictions are being applied. 

I will now carefully review and rewrite the solution, ensuring the restrictions are considered properly and the minimum path duration is calculated correctly:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def solve_zmeu_problem(in_filename, out_filename):
    # Read the input file
    with open(in_filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())  # Number of heads, stories, and restrictions
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = defaultdict(list)
        for _ in range(k):
            prev_story, next_story = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[next_story].append(prev_story)

    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Starting from the first story

    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, p):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if dp[i - 1][j] < float('inf'):  # There is a way to reach story i with j heads
                for next_story in range(i + 1, p):
                    if i not in restrictions[next_story]:  # Check restrictions
                        next_heads = j - stories[next_story][1]
                        if next_heads >= 0:  # Zmeu must survive
                            dp[next_story][next_heads] = min(dp[next_story][next_heads], dp[i - 1][j] + stories[next_story][0])

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story while having at least one head
    min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open(out_filename, 'w') as file:
        if min_duration == float('inf'):
            file.write('-1\n')
        else:
            file.write(f'{min_duration}\n')

# Run the solve_zmeu_problem function with the given filenames
solve_zmeu_problem('zmeu.in', 'zmeu.out')
```

This implementation correctly initializes the DP table, uses the restrictions to filter out invalid story sequences, and finds the minimum duration to reach the last story while having at least one head left. The output should now match the expected result.

The incorrect output suggests that the dynamic programming transitions are still not being handled correctly, or the restrictions are not being applied properly. 

The main issue seems to be with the DP transition logic. Let's attempt to solve the problem again, considering the restrictions properly:

1. We will use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end, considering the number of heads lost and the restrictions.
2. Each node in our graph will represent a story and the number of heads remaining at that point in time.
3. We will use a priority queue (heap) to keep track of the minimum duration paths as we explore them.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def solve_zmeu_problem(in_filename, out_filename):
    with open(in_filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = defaultdict(list)
        for _ in range(k):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[a].append(b)

    # Initialize distances array with infinities
    distances = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    # Starting story with all heads
    distances[1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]
    # Priority queue for Dijkstra's algorithm
    pq = [(stories[1][0], 1, n - stories[1][1])]

    while pq:
        duration, story, heads = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if story == p:
            continue
        for next_story in range(story + 1, p + 1):
            # Check for restriction
            if next_story in restrictions[story]:
                continue
            # Calculate heads left after the next story
            next_heads = heads - stories[next_story][1]
            if next_heads > 0:
                next_duration = duration + stories[next_story][0]
                if distances[next_story][next_heads] > next_duration:
                    distances[next_story][next_heads] = next_duration
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (next_duration, next_story, next_heads))

    result = min(distances[p][1:]) if min(distances[p][1:]) != float('inf') else -1

    with open(out_filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")

solve_zmeu_problem('zmeu.in', 'zmeu.out')

This solution uses a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the first to the last story, respecting the restrictions and ensuring that the Zmeu has at least one head left. The distances array keeps track of the minimum duration to reach each story with a given number of heads, and the priority queue is used to explore the stories in order of increasing duration. The answer is written to `zmeu.out`.

The found output indicates that the current approach is still not correctly taking into account the restrictions or the sequence of stories. Upon further analysis, it appears that the main issue with the previous solutions lies in the handling of the restrictions and the updating of the DP table or Dijkstra's algorithm.

Let's take a different approach that more closely adheres to the requirements of the problem. We will use Bellman-Ford algorithm since it's better suited for graphs with a relatively small number of vertices but potentially many edges, which is the case for our restrictions.

With Bellman-Ford, we can also easily handle restrictions by simply not relaxing edges that violate the restrictions. We will use a 3D DP array, where `dp[i][j][h]` represents the minimum duration to reach story `i` using `j` stories with `h` heads left.

Here is the rewritten correct solution:

```python
import sys

def solve_zmeu_problem(in_filename, out_filename):
    with open(in_filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [None] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = defaultdict(set)
        for _ in range(k):
            before, after = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[after].add(before)
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[[sys.maxsize for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(p + 1)] for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][1][n - stories[1][1]] = stories[1][0]

    for i in range(1, p + 1):  # For each number of stories told
        for u in range(1, p + 1):  # For each story
            for h in range(n + 1):  # For each number of heads left
                if dp[u][i][h] < sys.maxsize:  # If reachable
                    for v in range(1, p + 1):  # For each potential next story
                        if v not in restrictions[u] and h >= stories[v][1]:  # Check restriction and survival
                            dp[v][i + 1][h - stories[v][1]] = min(dp[v][i + 1][h - stories[v][1]], dp[u][i][h] + stories[v][0])

    # Find the minimum duration to reach the last story with at least one head left
    result = min(dp[p][i][h] for i in range(1, p + 1) for h in range(1, n + 1))

    with open(out_filename, 'w') as file:
        if result == sys.maxsize:
            file.write('-1\n')
        else:
            file.write(f'{result}\n')

solve_zmeu_problem('zmeu.in', 'zmeu.out')
```

This solution uses a 3D DP array to keep track of the story index, the number of stories told, and the number of heads left. It iterates over all possible numbers of stories told and updates the DP table, ensuring that it does not relax edges that would violate the restrictions. The result is written to `zmeu.out`, reflecting the minimum duration to reach the final story with at least one head left, or `-1` if it's not possible.
