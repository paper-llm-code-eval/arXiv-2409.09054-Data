Se consideră o mulțime $S$ care conține $N$ șiruri de caractere formate din litere mici ale alfabetului englezesc.  

Un șir de caractere se numește _interesant_ în raport cu celelalte șiruri ale mulțimii, dacă nu există un alt șir în mulțime care să-l conțină ca subșir. De exemplu, dacă mulțimea $S$ conține șirurile `abc`, `bde` și `abcdef`, atunci singurul șir *interesant* este `abcdef` deoarece `abc` și `bde` nu îl conțin ca subșir. Mai mult, `abc` și `bde` sunt subșiruri în `abcdef`, deci nu sunt *interesante*.

# Cerințe

Fiind dată o mulțime $S$ formată din $N$ șiruri de caractere se cere:

1. Să se determine cel mai lung șir. Dacă sunt mai multe șiruri având aceeași lungime maximă, se cere cel mai mic din punct de vedere lexicografic.
2. Să se determine toate șirurile _interesante_ din  mulțimea $S$.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `interesant.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $p$ și $N$, despărțite prin spațiu. Pentru toate testele de intrare, numărul $p$ poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau valoarea $2$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc șirurile de caractere, câte unul pe linie.


# Date de ieșire


Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $1$, **se va rezolva numai cerința $1$**.

În acest caz, în fișierul de ieșire `interesant.out` se va scrie cel mai lung șir dintre cele citite. Dacă există mai multe șiruri de aceeași lungime, se va scrie cel mai mic din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $2$, **se va rezolva numai cerința $2$**.

În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `interesant.out` va conține pe prima linie o valoare $K$ ce reprezintă numărul de șiruri _interesante_, iar pe următoarele $K$ linii, șirurile *interesante* **în ordinea în care apar în fișierul de intrare**.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 200$
* Lungimea unui șir va fi cuprinsă între $1$ și $5 \ 000$.
* Un subșir al șirului de caractere $C_0 C_1 C_2 \dots C_k$ se definește ca fiind o succesiune de caractere $C_{i_1} C_{i_2} C_{i_3} \dots C_{i_k}$, unde $0 \leq i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < \dots < i_k \leq k$.
* Fișierul de intrare **NU conține șiruri identice**.

The solution failed to identify the interesting strings correctly because it treated every non-substring string as interesting, which is not accurate. Two possible issues might be causing the incorrect results:

1. The `in` operator is not a correct way to check for a substring because it checks for subsequence too. We need a more strict check that makes sure the characters are contiguous in the superstring.
2. Even with a correct substring check, the logic is incorrect because it potentially includes strings that are substrings of longer strings.

To fix the solution, we need to identify strings that are not contained within any other string in our set.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution for the programming challenge

# Read the file `interesant.in` and process the data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

# Write to file `interesant.out` depending on the value of p
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        # Finding the longest string, lexicographically smallest if lengths are equal
        max_length = max(map(len, strings))
        longest_strings = [s for s in strings if len(s) == max_length]
        longest_string = min(longest_strings)
        file.write(longest_string)
    elif p == 2:
        # Finding interesting strings
        # Sort strings by length in descending order to compare longer strings first
        sorted_strings = sorted(strings, key=len, reverse=True)
        interesting_strings = []

        for i, s in enumerate(sorted_strings):
            # Compare with longer or same-length strings that come before it in the list
            if not any(s in other for other in sorted_strings[:i]):
                interesting_strings.append(s)

        # Restore the original order as required by the problem statement
        interesting_order = sorted(interesting_strings, key=strings.index)

        file.write(str(len(interesting_order)) + '\n')
        file.write('\n'.join(interesting_order))
```

In this solution, the strings are first sorted by length in descending order, which allows us to only check each string against strings that are longer or of the same length, which come before it in the list. After finding the interesting strings, we sort them back according to their original order before writing them to the output file. This ensures that the output is in the order that the strings appeared in the input file.

Upon reviewing the issue, it appears that the substring containment check is incorrect. The check `s in other` is used to determine if string `s` is a substring of `other`, which also unintentionally captures cases where `s` is a subsequence of `other` but not a contiguous substring. We need a stricter check to ensure that `s` is a contiguous substring of `other`.

Additionally, in the output, we need to ensure that only strings that are not substrings of any other strings are considered interesting. The previous solution did not properly consider this, as it allowed for strings that are substrings of longer strings to be marked as interesting.

Let's revise the solution to fix these issues:

```python
# Solution for the programming challenge

# Read the file `interesant.in` and process the data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

# Write to file `interesant.out` depending on the value of p
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        # Finding the longest string, lexicographically smallest if lengths are equal
        max_length = max(map(len, strings))
        longest_strings = [s for s in strings if len(s) == max_length]
        longest_string = min(longest_strings)
        file.write(longest_string)
    elif p == 2:
        # Finding interesting strings
        interesting_strings = []  # list to hold interesting strings
        for s in strings:
            is_interesting = True
            for other in strings:
                if s != other and s in other:
                    # Found a string that contains s, so s is not interesting
                    is_interesting = False
                    break
            if is_interesting:
                interesting_strings.append(s)
        # Write the number of interesting strings
        file.write(str(len(interesting_strings)) + '\n')
        # Write the interesting strings
        file.write('\n'.join(interesting_strings))
```

This corrected solution ensures that we check every string against all other strings in the set to confirm whether it is interesting or not—meaning it is not a substring of any other string. The interesting strings are then written to the output file `interesant.out` in the order they appear in the input file, as required by the problem statement.

The previous solution incorrectly reported strings as interesting even if they were substrings of other strings in the set, due to the incorrect usage of the `in` operator. We need to ensure that, for each string `s`, there are no other strings in the set of which `s` is a proper substring.

A proper substring check should ensure that for any string `s` to be interesting, there is no string `other` in the set such that `s` is contained within `other` at any position, and `s` is not equal to `other`.

Let's implement an improved solution that correctly identifies interesting strings:

```python
# Solution for the programming challenge

# Function to check if s is a proper substring of other
def is_proper_substring(s, other):
    if s == other:
        return False
    try:
        return other.index(s) >= 0  # True if s is a proper substring
    except ValueError:
        return False  # s is not a substring of other

# Read the file `interesant.in` and process the data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

# Write to file `interesant.out` depending on the value of p
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        # Find the longest string; if tie, lexicographically smallest
        max_length = max(len(s) for s in strings)
        longest_string = min((s for s in strings if len(s) == max_length), key=str)
        file.write(longest_string + '\n')
    elif p == 2:
        # Find interesting strings
        interesting_strings = []
        for s in strings:
            if not any(is_proper_substring(s, other) for other in strings if s != other):
                interesting_strings.append(s)
        # Write the number of interesting strings
        file.write(f'{len(interesting_strings)}\n')
        # Write the interesting strings in the order they appear in the input file
        for s in interesting_strings:
            file.write(s + '\n')
```

This solution introduces the helper function `is_proper_substring` that strictly checks if one string is a proper substring of another. It then uses this function to filter out non-interesting strings. The output is written to the file `interesant.out`, including the number of interesting strings, followed by each interesting string on a new line, preserving the original order from the input.

The previous solutions were incorrect because they did not properly handle the case where a string is a proper substring of another string. We need to ensure we are identifying 'interesting' strings correctly. A string is 'interesting' if it is not a proper substring of any other string in the set.

The correct approach is to compare each string against all other strings and exclude it if it is found to be a proper substring of any other string. We must do this comparison for all strings in the set.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
# Solution for the programming challenge

# Read the file `interesant.in` and process the data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

# Function to determine if a string is a substring of any other strings
def is_substring(s, others):
    return any(s in other for other in others if s != other)

# Write to file `interesant.out` depending on the value of p
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        # Find the longest string; if tie, lexicographically smallest
        max_length = max(len(s) for s in strings)
        longest_string = min((s for s in strings if len(s) == max_length), key=str)
        file.write(longest_string + '\n')
    elif p == 2:
        # Find interesting strings
        interesting_strings = [s for s in strings if not is_substring(s, strings)]
        # Write the number of interesting strings
        file.write(f'{len(interesting_strings)}\n')
        # Write the interesting strings in the order they appear in the input file
        for s in interesting_strings:
            file.write(s + '\n')
```

This solution checks for each string `s` if it is a substring of any other string in the set (excluding itself) using the `is_substring` function. If it is not a substring, it is considered interesting. After collecting all interesting strings, it writes the count and the strings themselves to `interesant.out`, preserving the order from the input file. This should produce the correct output.

The output is not as expected because the `is_substring` function incorrectly identifies strings as 'interesting'. A string should not be considered 'interesting' if it is a proper substring of any other string in the set. In the current logic, if a string `s` is a substring of another string `other`, it should not be included in the interesting strings list, but the function doesn't correctly apply this rule.

We need to fix this by ensuring the `is_substring` function only returns `True` if `s` is a proper substring of another string `other` — meaning `s` is contained within `other` and `s` is not equal to `other`.

Here is the revised and corrected solution:

```python
# Solution for the programming challenge

# Read the file `interesant.in` and process the data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

# Write to file `interesant.out` depending on the value of p
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    if p == 1:
        # Finding the longest string, lexicographically smallest if lengths are equal
        max_length = max(len(s) for s in strings)
        longest_strings = [s for s in strings if len(s) == max_length]
        longest_string = min(longest_strings)
        file.write(longest_string + '\n')
    elif p == 2:
        # Finding interesting strings
        interesting_strings = []

        # Sort strings by length in descending order to ensure that
        # substring comparisons are done against all potential superstrings
        strings_sorted = sorted(strings, key=len, reverse=True)

        while strings_sorted:
            current = strings_sorted.pop()  # Remove the last element which is the shortest
            if all(current not in other for other in strings_sorted):
                interesting_strings.append(current)

        # Write the number of interesting strings and the strings themselves
        file.write(f'{len(interesting_strings)}\n')
        file.write('\n'.join(interesting_strings))
```

In this version of the solution, strings are sorted by their lengths in descending order. When checking for interesting strings, the shortest string is popped from the list and checked against all other remaining strings (which are longer or of equal length). If it is not a substring of any other string, it is considered interesting. After identifying all interesting strings, the solution writes the count and the strings to `interesant.out`. This should produce the expected output.
