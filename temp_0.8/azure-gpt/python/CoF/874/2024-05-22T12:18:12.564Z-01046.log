Se consideră o mulțime $S$ care conține $N$ șiruri de caractere formate din litere mici ale alfabetului englezesc.  

Un șir de caractere se numește _interesant_ în raport cu celelalte șiruri ale mulțimii, dacă nu există un alt șir în mulțime care să-l conțină ca subșir. De exemplu, dacă mulțimea $S$ conține șirurile `abc`, `bde` și `abcdef`, atunci singurul șir *interesant* este `abcdef` deoarece `abc` și `bde` nu îl conțin ca subșir. Mai mult, `abc` și `bde` sunt subșiruri în `abcdef`, deci nu sunt *interesante*.

# Cerințe

Fiind dată o mulțime $S$ formată din $N$ șiruri de caractere se cere:

1. Să se determine cel mai lung șir. Dacă sunt mai multe șiruri având aceeași lungime maximă, se cere cel mai mic din punct de vedere lexicografic.
2. Să se determine toate șirurile _interesante_ din  mulțimea $S$.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `interesant.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $p$ și $N$, despărțite prin spațiu. Pentru toate testele de intrare, numărul $p$ poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau valoarea $2$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc șirurile de caractere, câte unul pe linie.


# Date de ieșire


Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $1$, **se va rezolva numai cerința $1$**.

În acest caz, în fișierul de ieșire `interesant.out` se va scrie cel mai lung șir dintre cele citite. Dacă există mai multe șiruri de aceeași lungime, se va scrie cel mai mic din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $2$, **se va rezolva numai cerința $2$**.

În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `interesant.out` va conține pe prima linie o valoare $K$ ce reprezintă numărul de șiruri _interesante_, iar pe următoarele $K$ linii, șirurile *interesante* **în ordinea în care apar în fișierul de intrare**.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 200$
* Lungimea unui șir va fi cuprinsă între $1$ și $5 \ 000$.
* Un subșir al șirului de caractere $C_0 C_1 C_2 \dots C_k$ se definește ca fiind o succesiune de caractere $C_{i_1} C_{i_2} C_{i_3} \dots C_{i_k}$, unde $0 \leq i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < \dots < i_k \leq k$.
* Fișierul de intrare **NU conține șiruri identice**.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly identifies interesting strings. A string is interesting only if no other string in the set contains it as a substring, but the original code was checking for substring containment in both directions (i.e., it checked if each string `s` was not contained in other strings `other` and also if `other` was not contained in `s`, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem).

To fix this, we need to adjust the condition for finding interesting strings such that we only check if the current string is contained in any other string (not the reverse). If it's not contained in any other string, then it is interesting.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

def is_interesting(s, strings):
    return not any(s in other for other in strings if s != other)

if p == 1:
    # Find the longest and lexicographically smallest string
    longest_string = min((s for s in strings), key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
    result = longest_string
else:
    # Find all interesting strings
    interesting = [s for s in strings if is_interesting(s, strings)]
    result = f"{len(interesting)}\n" + "\n".join(interesting)

# Write the output data
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(result + "\n")
```

This should now only check for substrings in one direction and correctly identify all interesting strings. The `is_interesting` function checks if the string `s` is contained within any other string in `strings` and returns `False` if it is, meaning the string `s` is not interesting. If `s` is not a substring of any other string, then it is considered interesting.

It appears the previous solutions had a logical error in the interesting strings identification procedure. It was incorrectly including strings that are actually sub-strings of longer strings in the set of interesting strings.

To address this, the correct approach is to iterate through each string and check if it is a sub-string of any other string in the set. If it is not a sub-string, then it is interesting. The comparison should only be one-way; that is, we should only check if `s` is contained within other strings, not if other strings are contained within `s`.

Here's the corrected and more efficient solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

def is_interesting(s, strings):
    for other in strings:
        if s != other and s in other:
            return False
    return True

if p == 1:
    # Find the longest and lexicographically smallest string
    longest_string = min(strings, key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
    result = longest_string
else:
    # Find all interesting strings
    # To optimize, we can sort first by length, descending, to check longer strings first.
    strings.sort(key=len, reverse=True)
    interesting = [s for s in strings if is_interesting(s, strings)]
    result = f"{len(interesting)}\n" + "\n".join(interesting)

# Write the output data
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(result + "\n")
```

In this solution, the `is_interesting` function checks if string `s` is a sub-string of any other string in `strings`. If it is, `s` is not interesting and the function returns `False`. If `s` is not a sub-string of any other string, then it is considered interesting and the function returns `True`.

The `p == 2` case is also optimized by sorting the strings by length in descending order before iterating. This way, the longer strings are considered first, and since a longer string can't be a sub-string of a shorter one, this reduces the number of comparisons needed.

Upon evaluating the results, the previous solution still contains strings that are sub-strings of other strings as interesting strings, which is incorrect. The expected output indicates that 'acd' and 'zyt' are not considered interesting because they are sub-strings of 'abcacaad' and 'zayyt', respectively.

The issue is that the previous solutions do not preserve the original order of strings after sorting, causing a mismatch with the requirement that interesting strings must be reported in the order they appear in the input file.

To fix the bug, we will keep track of the original order of strings and ensure that we only mark a string as interesting if no longer string contains it. Here is the corrected solution that maintains the original order and efficiently checks for the interesting strings:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

if p == 1:
    # Find the longest and lexicographically smallest string
    longest_string = min(strings, key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
    result = longest_string
else:
    # Find all interesting strings, maintaining the original order
    interesting = strings.copy()
    for i, s in enumerate(strings):
        for other in strings[i+1:]:
            if s in other:  # If s is a substring of other, remove s from interesting
                interesting.remove(s)
                break
    result = f"{len(interesting)}\n" + "\n".join(interesting)

# Write the output data
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(result + "\n")
```

In this solution, we maintain the original order of strings by iterating through the list only once and checking each string against all following strings in the list (longer strings would come later due to their positions in the input file). We remove a string from the interesting list if it is found to be a sub-string of any other string that comes after it. This way, we ensure that interesting strings are reported in the order they appear in the input file.

The problem arises because the code incorrectly checks each string against all strings that come after it in the list. This logic fails to account for the case where a string that comes earlier in the list contains a string that appears later. We need a way to ensure that a string is not a substring of any other string in the list, regardless of its position.

To correct this, let's implement the following logic: for each string, we will check it against all other strings in the list. If the string is found to be a substring of any other string, it is not interesting, and we should not include it in the result.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

if p == 1:
    # Find the longest and lexicographically smallest string
    longest_string = min(strings, key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
    result = longest_string
else:
    # Find all interesting strings, preserving original order
    interesting = []
    for s in strings:
        if all(s not in other or other == s for other in strings):
            interesting.append(s)
    result = f"{len(interesting)}\n" + "\n".join(interesting)

# Write the output data
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(result + "\n")
```

This code ensures that a string is included in the interesting list only if it is not a substring of any other string in the entire list, preserving the original order of strings. As a result, it should produce the expected output.

The issue in the previous solutions arises from the incorrect interpretation of the condition for a string to be considered interesting. A string is interesting only if none of the other strings contain it as a substring, but the previous solutions failed to eliminate all substrings properly.

To fix this, let's use a more careful approach where we track which strings have been marked as not interesting, and only output those that remain unmarked at the end:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('interesant.in', 'r') as file:
    p, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

# Function to determine if a string is a substring of any other strings
def is_substring(s, others):
    for other in others:
        if s != other and s in other:
            return True
    return False

if p == 1:
    # Find the longest and lexicographically smallest string
    longest_string = min(strings, key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
    result = longest_string
else:
    # Find all interesting strings
    interesting = []
    for s in strings:
        if not is_substring(s, strings):
            interesting.append(s)
    result = f"{len(interesting)}\n" + "\n".join(interesting)

# Write the output data
with open('interesant.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(result + "\n")
```

In this revised solution for p == 2, the `is_substring` function checks if the given string `s` is a substring of any other string in the list `others`. We iterate over each string in the input list and call this function, passing all strings in the list as `others`. If `is_substring` returns `False`, meaning that `s` is not a substring of any other string, `s` is considered interesting and is added to the `interesting` list. This method ensures that all interesting strings are found in their original input order. The output is then written to `interesant.out`.
