Un copil construiește un triunghi cu numerele naturale nenule astfel:

* în vârful triunghiului scrie valoarea $1$;
* completează liniile triunghiului de sus în jos, iar căsuțele de pe aceeași linie de la stânga la dreapta cu numere naturale consecutive, ca în figurile următoare.

~[numere.png]

În figura din stânga este ilustrat un astfel de triunghi având $5$ linii, conținând numerele naturale de la $1$ la $15$. În acest triunghi copilul începe să construiască drumuri, respectând următoarele reguli:

* orice drum începe din $1$;
* din orice căsuță se poate deplasa fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în stânga sa (deplasare codificată cu $1$), fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în dreapta sa (deplasare codficată cu $2$);
* orice drum va fi descris prin succesiunea deplasărilor efectuate.

De exemplu, drumul ilustrat în figura din dreapta poate fi descris astfel: $1$, $2$, $2$, $2$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care rezolvă următoarele două cerințe:

* citește descrierea unui drum și afișează numărul la care se termină drumul;
* citește un număr natural nenul $K$, determină un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$ pentru care suma numerelor prin care trece drumul este maximă și afișează această sumă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numere.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând cerința din problemă care trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$).

* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, a doua linie din fișier conține un număr natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea drumului, iar a treia linie din fișier conține descrierea drumului sub forma a $N$ valori, $1$ sau $2$, separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.
* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$, a doua linie din fișier conține numărul natural $K$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un singur număr natural. Dacă $C = 1$, va fi scris numărul cu care se termină drumul descris în fișierul de intrare. Dacă $C = 2$, va fi scrisă suma maximă a numerelor aflate pe un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $40$ de puncte; pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $50$ de puncte. $10$ puncte se acordă din oficiu.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
def read_path_and_find_number():

    for move in moves:

    pos = K

    # The max sum path to K will always be going right first then left
    # Calculate the sum for the path that goes all the way right then left to K
    sum_path = level * (level + 1) // 2  # Sum of all numbers in the level
    sum_path -= (level - pos) * (level - pos + 1) // 2  # Subtract the numbers to the right of K

    read_path_and_find_number()
else:
    K = int(next(open('numere.in')).split()[1])
    calculate_max_sum_for_K(K)
```

This solution reads the task from `numere.in`, executes the appropriate function based on the task, and writes the result to `numere.out`. It does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations. For task 1, it calculates the number at the end of the path. For task 2, it calculates the maximum sum path for the given number K based on observations about the structure of the triangle.

Upon reviewing the output, it seems that there is a mistake in the calculation of the number at the end of the path in the `read_path_and_find_number` function. I will rewrite this function to correctly find the ending number of the path. 

The bug is due to the incorrect computation of the position of the number in the level. The mistake is in the line "number += level - 1 + pos - 1". We should not add "level - 1" to the number because we have already included it in the previous iteration.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_path_and_find_number():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line since we know the task is 1
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    level = 1
    pos = 1
    number = 1
    for move in moves:
        level += 1
        pos += move - 1
        number += pos

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(number))

def calculate_max_sum_for_K(K):
    # Find level and position of the target number K
    level = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        level += 1
    pos = K

    # The max sum path to K will always be going right first then left
    # Calculate the sum for the path that goes all the way right then left to K
    sum_path = level * (level + 1) // 2  # Sum of all numbers in the level
    sum_path -= (level - pos) * (level - pos + 1) // 2  # Subtract the numbers to the right of K

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(sum_path))

# Main execution
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    if task == 1:
        read_path_and_find_number()
    else:
        K = int(file.readline().strip())
        calculate_max_sum_for_K(K)
```

This solution should now properly calculate the number at the end of the path for task 1 and correctly calculate the maximum sum path for a given number K for task 2. It reads the task from `numere.in`, performs the appropriate calculation, and writes the result to `numere.out` without using `input()` or `print()`.

It appears there is still an error in the logic of the `read_path_and_find_number` function. The ending number is not being calculated correctly. The previous fix addressed the wrong part of the logic; rather than adding the current level and position directly, we need to consider how the triangle is formed and how the numbers increment as we move through the levels.

Here's the corrected logic: Starting from the tip of the triangle (number 1), each move down to the left (1) or to the right (2) will change the current number. When moving down to the next level, the number increases by the number of elements in the current level (since it is the first number of the next level). Moving to the right will increment the number further by its position in that level.

Let's correct the function with the right logic:

```python
def read_path_and_find_number():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line since we know the task is 1
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    current_level = 1
    index_in_level = 0  # Start index is 0 because we are at the top of the triangle
    current_number = 1  # Start number is 1 because we are at the top of the triangle

    for move in moves:
        current_level += 1  # Move down one level
        index_in_level += (move - 1)  # Move right if move is 2
        current_number += current_level + index_in_level  # Calculate new number

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(current_number))

def calculate_max_sum_for_K(K):
    # The rest of the function remains the same as it is correct
    # Find level and position of the target number K
    level = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        level += 1
    pos = K

    # The max sum path to K will always be going right first then left
    # Calculate the sum for the path that goes all the way right then left to K
    sum_path = level * (level + 1) // 2  # Sum of all numbers in the level
    sum_path -= (level - pos) * (level - pos + 1) // 2  # Subtract the numbers to the right of K

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(sum_path))

# Main execution
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    if task == 1:
        read_path_and_find_number()
    else:
        K = int(file.readline().strip())
        calculate_max_sum_for_K(K)
```

This correction addresses the mistake in the calculation of the ending number. The path described by the moves should now be correctly followed, and the expected output should match the actual output.

Upon re-evaluating the algorithm, I see that the error lies in the calculation for the ending number after moving through the path. It seems there is an issue with how I am updating `current_number` after each move.

For each move down a level, the next number increases by the previous level's size. Then if the move is to the right, it will increase by one more. Thus, after moving down from level `current_level` to the next level, the first number at that level is `current_number + current_level`. If we then move to the right, we must add 1 to the current number for each right move (2).

Let's correct the code once more with this logic:

```python
def read_path_and_find_number():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line since we know the task is 1
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    current_number = 1

    for current_level, move in enumerate(moves, start=1):
        current_number += current_level if move == 1 else current_level + 1

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(current_number))

def calculate_max_sum_for_K(K):
    level = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        level += 1
    max_sum = (level * (level + 1)) // 2
    min_sum = ((level - K) * (level - K + 1)) // 2
    max_sum_path = max_sum - min_sum

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum_path))

# Main execution
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    if task == 1:
        read_path_and_find_number()
    else:
        K = int(file.readline().strip())
        calculate_max_sum_for_K(K)
```

This correction should ensure that the ending number is calculated correctly by properly considering the increment after each move down and to the right. The expected output should now match the actual output.

The provided code for task 2 does not give the expected output because the algorithm for calculating the maximum sum path is incorrect. The maximum sum path to reach a given number K must include as many right moves (coded as 2) as possible, as these moves always lead to larger numbers within the triangle. Going right moves us to the end of a row, which has the largest numbers.

Let's correct the algorithm for task 2 to find the maximum sum correctly. We will calculate the row and position of the number K in the triangle and then find the maximum sum by considering the most right moves (2s) possible before moving to the left (1s) to reach the target number.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_path_and_find_number():
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Task is 1, so we can ignore it here
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        path = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    number = 1
    level = 1
    for move in path:
        if move == 1:
            number += level
        elif move == 2:
            number += level + 1
        level += 1

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(number))

def calculate_max_sum_for_K(K):
    level = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        level += 1
    pos = K

    # Start from the largest number in the level, which is `level * (level + 1) // 2`
    # Then, subtract the difference to get to the actual position
    max_sum = level * (level + 1) // 2
    diff = level - pos
    max_sum -= diff * (diff + 1) // 2

    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))

# Main execution
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    if task == 1:
        read_path_and_find_number()
    else:
        K = int(file.readline().strip())
        calculate_max_sum_for_K(K)
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the maximum sum path to a given number K for task 2, taking into account the structure of the triangle and the moves that lead to the highest sum. It reads the input from `numere.in` and writes the output to `numere.out` without using `input()` or `print()`.

The issue with the current solution for task 2 is that it is not computing the maximum sum correctly. To find the maximum sum path that ends at number K, we need to maximize the number of right moves (coded as 2) because right moves lead to larger numbers in the triangle.

The maximum sum path is achieved by first moving to the rightmost position in each row and then moving left to reach the target number. In a triangle, for the Kth number, the maximum sum path will be to go all the way to the right until the row before the row containing K, and then go to the left until we reach K.

Let's correct the solution for calculating the maximum sum path:

```python
def calculate_max_sum_for_K(K):
    # Calculate the row (level) where K is located
    level = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        level += 1
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum path ending at K
    # It consists of moving right at every step except the last required steps to reach K
    max_sum = 0
    right_steps = level - 1  # Maximum number of right moves
    number = 1
    for row in range(1, level):
        if row < right_steps:
            max_sum += number + row
            number += row + 1
        else:
            max_sum += number
            number += row
    
    # Now add K to the sum because we are at the last row
    max_sum += K
    
    return max_sum

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    if task == 1:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        path = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    else:
        K = int(file.readline().strip())

# Perform task
if task == 1:
    number = find_number_from_path(N, path)
else:
    max_sum = calculate_max_sum_for_K(K)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if task == 1:
        file.write(str(number))
    else:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This corrected solution should now provide the correct maximum sum path for a given number K for task 2. The function `calculate_max_sum_for_K` finds the level where K is located, determines the rightmost path as far as possible, and then moves to the left to reach K. The solution reads the input from `numere.in` and writes the output to `numere.out` without using `input()` or `print()`.

The error message indicates that `find_number_from_path` is not defined. This function was intended to be used for task 1 but it was not implemented in the code, nor was its logic included in the `read_path_and_find_number` function that I previously provided. This needs to be corrected.

Let's fix the issue by defining the function for task 1 and correcting the function for task 2 within a single complete code block:

```python
def find_number_from_path(N, path):
    # Function to find the number at the end of the path for task 1
    current_level = 1
    current_index = 1  # Index within the current level
    for move in path:
        current_level += 1
        if move == 2:
            current_index += 1
    # Calculate the value at the position using the triangle properties
    number_at_end = (current_level * (current_level - 1)) // 2 + current_index
    return number_at_end

def calculate_max_sum_for_K(K):
    # Function to calculate the maximum sum for task 2
    level = 1
    current_number = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        current_number += level
        level += 1
    # Maximum sum is achieved by always choosing the rightmost number in each level
    # until reaching the level containing K. From there, choose the number directly above K.
    max_sum = sum(range(1, current_number)) + sum(range(current_number, current_number + K))
    return max_sum

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    task = int(file.readline().strip())
    if task == 1:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        path = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    else:
        K = int(file.readline().strip())

# Perform task
if task == 1:
    number = find_number_from_path(N, path)
else:
    max_sum = calculate_max_sum_for_K(K)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if task == 1:
        file.write(str(number))
    else:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This solution should now function correctly for both task 1 and task 2. The `find_number_from_path` function is implemented to find the number at the end of the given path, and the `calculate_max_sum_for_K` function is corrected to accurately compute the maximum sum path that ends at number K. The solution reads from `numere.in` and writes to `numere.out` without using `input()` or `print()`.
