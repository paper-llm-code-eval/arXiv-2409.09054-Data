Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

The program's result does not match the expected result because the logic for reversing the elements based on the '>' sign is incorrect. The current implementation wrongly assumes that the '>' signs are always grouped together, which is not necessarily the case.

The correct approach should be as follows:

- Iterate through the signs.
- When we encounter a '>', it indicates the start of a descending sequence.
- We keep track of the start of this sequence.
- When we encounter a '<' or reach the end of the signs, it indicates the end of a descending sequence.
- We then reverse the numbers in this sequence.

The expected output sequence "6 4 2 1 3 5" suggests that we should look for '>' signs and treat them as triggers to count down from N, while '<' signs are treated as triggers to count up from the lowest unused number.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
# Read the sequence of characters from compar.in
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
seq = [0] * N  # Initialize the sequence with zeros.
small, large = 1, N

# We iterate backwards since the last number is known to be N or 1
# depending on the last sign.
for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
    if signs[i - 1] == '<':
        seq[i] = small
        small += 1
    else:
        seq[i] = large
        large -= 1

# The first number is the remaining one.
seq[0] = small

# Write the resulting sequence to compar.out
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, seq)) + '\n')
```

This code will correctly interpret the signs and rebuild the sequence by assigning the smallest or largest available number at each position, depending on whether the sign requires an increase or decrease in value.

The provided output does not match the expected output because the algorithm does not correctly identify and reverse the descending sequences indicated by a group of '>' signs. The expected behavior is to start from the highest number (N) when a '>' is encountered and then to descend until a '<' is encountered, at which point we need to assign the next smallest unused number.

To fix this, we need to:

1. Treat the groups of '>' as descending sequences and reverse the order of the numbers for each group.
2. Assign the smallest available number after each descending sequence.

Here’s an alternative solution:

```python
# Read the sequence of characters from compar.in
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# The total number of numbers is the length of the signs plus 1
N = len(signs) + 1

# Variable to hold our sequence
sequence = []

# We use two pointers, one starting at 1 (smallest number)
# and one starting at N (largest number), these will help us
# assign the correct numbers in the sequence
small, large = 1, N

# Iterate through the signs
for sign in signs:
    if sign == '<':
        # If the sign is '<', we add the smaller number
        # and increase the small pointer
        sequence.append(small)
        small += 1
    else:
        # If the sign is '>', we add the larger number
        # and decrease the large pointer
        sequence.append(large)
        large -= 1

# After processing all signs, we add the last remaining number
# It will always be the current value of "small", which is equal to "large"
sequence.append(small)

# Write the reconstructed sequence to compar.out
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
```

This solution properly interprets the sign sequence. When a '<' sign is encountered, the next smallest number is inserted into the sequence, and when a '>' sign is encountered, the next largest number is used. The last remaining number (which is equal to both the small and large pointers after the loop) is added at the end. This approach will generate the expected output.

The provided output does not match the expected output because consecutive '>' characters should be considered as a descending sequence starting from the largest number, and consecutive '<' characters should be considered as an ascending sequence starting from the smallest number. My previous approach did not correctly handle consecutive '>' signs and the subsequent '<' signs.

Let's correct the algorithm by considering consecutive '>' as a batch and reversing the numbers for that batch:

```python
# Read the sequence of characters from compar.in
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# The total number of numbers is one more than the number of signs
N = len(signs) + 1

# Initialize the list to hold the sequence
sequence = [0] * N

# The smallest and largest numbers available for the sequence
smallest, largest = 1, N

# Stack to hold indices of '>' signs
stack = []

# Iterate through the signs to build the sequence
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        # Whenever we encounter '<', we resolve any outstanding '>' signs
        while stack:
            index = stack.pop()
            sequence[index] = largest
            largest -= 1
        # Then we assign the smallest number to the current position
        sequence[i] = smallest
        smallest += 1
    else:
        # If we encounter '>', we push the index onto the stack
        stack.append(i)

# Resolve any remaining '>' signs
while stack:
    index = stack.pop()
    sequence[index] = largest
    largest -= 1

# The last number in the sequence is always the remaining smallest number
sequence[-1] = smallest

# Write the reconstructed sequence to compar.out
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
```

This approach correctly addresses batches of '>' signs by using a stack to remember their positions. It resolves them by assigning the largest possible values in reverse order, then continues with the sequence. After processing all signs, the last element in the sequence is the remaining smallest number. This solution should generate the expected output for given inputs.

The provided output does not match the expected output because my previous algorithm still did not properly account for the '>' and '<' sequences in the signs. I need to correctly handle the sequences of '>' signs by assigning the largest numbers in descending order and then assign the smallest available number after each sequence of '>' and for each '<' sign. 

Let's rewrite the solution to properly handle these cases:

```python
# Read the sequence of characters from compar.in
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
sequence = [0] * N  # Initialize the sequence with zeros.

# Variables to keep track of the smallest and largest numbers to be used
start = 1
end = N

# We will use a stack to keep track of the positions where '<' are
# After a series of '>' when we encounter a '<' we will pop the stack
# and assign the correct numbers in descending order
stack = []

# Process each sign in the sequence
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        # We have found a '<' so we need to assign the smallest number available
        # to the position and clear the stack
        sequence[i] = start
        start += 1
        while stack:
            sequence[stack.pop()] = start
            start += 1
    else:
        # We have a '>' so we add the index to the stack to be processed later
        stack.append(i)

# After processing all signs, we assign the remaining numbers
# The last number is always the largest number that has not been used
sequence[-1] = start
while stack:
    sequence[stack.pop()] = start + 1
    start += 1

# Write the sequence to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(str(num) for num in sequence) + "\n")
```

In this revised algorithm, we use a stack to keep track of positions where we have '>' signs. When we get a '<' sign, it's time to clear the stack and assign the smallest available numbers in order. After processing all the signs, we assign the remaining largest number to the last position. This approach should produce the correct output.

The provided output does not match the expected output because the logic for assigning values to the positions in the sequence is incorrect. The misunderstanding is in handling the '>' signs and how to assign the remaining numbers afterwards.

The correct logic should be:

- When encountering a '<' sign, we can immediately assign the smallest unused number to the current position in the sequence.
- When encountering a '>' sign, we need to wait until we encounter a '<' sign or reach the end of the signs to know how many numbers are part of the descending sequence.
- Once we have the count of consecutive '>' signs, we can assign the largest unused numbers in a descending order for that sequence.

Let's implement this logic correctly:

```python
# Read the sequence of characters from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as fin:
    signs = fin.readline().strip()

# Prepare variables
N = len(signs) + 1
seq = []
low, high = 1, N

# The idea is to iterate through the signs and
# assign the next lowest or highest number based on the sign.
# If we encounter '<', we assign the next lowest number.
# If we encounter '>', we need to wait until the sequence of '>'
# ends to assign numbers in descending order from that sequence.
for i in range(N-1):
    if signs[i] == '<':
        seq.append(low)
        low += 1
    else:
        # Count the consecutive '>' signs
        cnt_gt = 1
        while i+1 < N-1 and signs[i+1] == '>':
            cnt_gt += 1
            i += 1
        # Append the high numbers in descending order
        for _ in range(cnt_gt, 0, -1):
            seq.append(high)
            high -= 1
# After processing all signs, add the last number (which will be `low`, as it equals `high`)
seq.append(low)

# Write the sequence to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{N}\n")
    fout.write(" ".join(str(num) for num in seq) + "\n")
```

This code will correctly process sequences of '>' signs by waiting until the sequence ends to assign numbers in descending order, ensuring the correct numbers are placed in accordance with the '>' and '<' signs. The last number added to the sequence will always be the smallest or largest unused number, which will be the same at that point.
