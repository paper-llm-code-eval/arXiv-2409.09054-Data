Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read the signs from file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N
stack = []

# Determine the positions for each number in the result list
current = 1
for i in range(N - 1):
    if signs[i] == '<':
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
    else:
        stack.append(current)
        while stack:
            result[i - len(stack) + 1] = stack.pop()
        current += 1

stack.append(current)
while stack:
    result[N - len(stack)] = stack.pop()

# Write the result to file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

The above code stores the sequence of numbers that need to be written to the output file based on the sequence of comparison signs. The stack is used to temporarily hold the numbers that are part of a descending sequence (when the signs are '>'), and when a '<' sign is encountered, it releases the stack, effectively placing the smallest numbers at the beginning of the increasing sequence. When the end of the sign string is reached, any remaining numbers in the stack are written to the end of the result list.

The issue seems to be an IndexError caused by an incorrect assignment to a list index that is out of range. This is likely occurring because the logic for determining the index at which to place the current number is off by one due to zero-based indexing in Python lists.

Let's correct the logic to ensure that we are assigning values within the bounds of the `result` list. I will also initialize the stack with the value `N` outside of the loop since we always have an implicit '<' at the very end.

```python
# Read the signs from file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N
stack = [N]

# Determine the positions for each number in the result list
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    if i == 0 or signs[i - 1] == '<':
        while stack:
            result[N - len(stack)] = stack.pop()
    stack.append(N - len(stack))

# Write the result to file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

In this fixed solution, we iterate from the end to the start of the `signs` string, and we prepare the `stack` with the value `N` to handle the last number. Whenever we encounter a '<' sign (or we are at the start of the string), we output all numbers currently in the stack in reverse order. This ensures that we always write to the correct position within the `result` list, and we avoid the IndexError.

The `IndexError` suggests that we're still trying to access an index out of the range of the `result` list. This can happen if we're not calculating the indices correctly when popping elements from the stack.

I will revise the solution to ensure that we calculate the correct indices for the `result` list, and to handle the '<' and '>' signs properly.

```python
# Read the signs from file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N
small = 1
large = N

# Determine the positions for each number in the result list
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        result[i] = small
        small += 1
    else:
        result[i] = large
        large -= 1

# The last number is always the remaining smallest or largest number
result[-1] = small if small <= large else large

# Write the result to file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

In this corrected version, we iterate through the `signs` and assign the smallest or largest available number to the current position in the `result` list, depending on whether the current sign is '<' or '>'. After handling all signs, we assign the last number to the end of the `result` list, which will be either the remaining smallest or largest number, since we have exactly one number left to place.

The current logic is assigning numbers to the `result` list based solely on whether the sign is '<' or '>', assigning the smallest or largest number available at that point. However, it does not correctly handle sequences of the same sign, where numbers should be assigned in a stack-like manner, because the numbers should be placed in descending order in the case of '>', and reserved for later to be placed in ascending order for '<'. As a result, the output sequence does not match the expected one, which requires the descending sequences to be placed before ascending ones.

To fix this, we need to revise the algorithm. We will use a stack approach to correctly handle sequences of '>' signs. For each '<' sign, we will place the next smallest number available. For each '>' sign, we will push the next smallest number onto a stack, and when we encounter a '<' sign or reach the end of the signs list, we pop and assign all numbers from the stack to the `result` list.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the signs from file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N
stack = []

# Determine the positions for each number in the result list
current_num = 1
for sign in signs:
    if sign == '<':
        result[len(stack)] = current_num
        # Assign all numbers from the stack to the result list
        while stack:
            idx = stack.pop()
            result[idx] = current_num
            current_num += 1
    else:  # sign is '>'
        # Push the index onto the stack
        stack.append(len(stack))
    current_num += 1

# Assign the remaining number to the last remaining position in result
result[len(stack)] = current_num
while stack:
    idx = stack.pop()
    result[idx] = current_num
    current_num += 1

# Write the result to file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This solution correctly handles sequences of '>' signs by using a stack to store indices where the numbers should be placed in descending order once a '<' sign is encountered. This should yield the correct sequence that matches the expected output for the input provided.

The result differs from the expected output because the current approach has a logical error in the way the indices for the `result` list are calculated and assigned. We need to ensure that, for a sequence of '>' signs, the numbers are placed in descending order, but the current code does not handle that correctly.

The fixed solution should do the following:
1. Iterate through the signs.
2. When encountering a '<' sign, assign the next available smallest number to the current position and output all numbers from the stack (which are in a descending sequence due to prior '>' signs).
3. When encountering a '>' sign, push the current position onto the stack for later assignment.

Let's fix the implementation:

```python
# Read the signs from file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [None] * N
stack = []

# Function to assign values from the stack in descending order
def assign_descending(start_value):
    value = start_value
    while stack:
        index = stack.pop()
        result[index] = value
        value -= 1
    return value

# Assigning numbers based on the signs
current_value = 1
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        result[i] = current_value
        current_value += 1
    else:
        stack.append(i)

# For the last number, we either continue the ascending sequence or start a new descending sequence
result[N - 1] = current_value
current_value += 1

# Assign numbers in descending order for any remaining '>' sequence
assign_descending(current_value)

# Write the result to file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This updated solution should correctly handle sequences of '>' signs by using the stack to track the indices where numbers need to be placed in descending order once we reach a '<' sign or the end of the signs list. This approach should provide the correct sequence, matching the expected output.

The corrected solution did not produce the expected output, and the problem lies with the logic for assigning numbers in descending sequence according to the '>' signs. We should be assigning the largest available numbers in descending order when encountering a '>' sign and populating the ascending sequence with the smallest numbers when encountering a '<' sign.

Let's fix the solution by revising the algorithm to correctly handle sequences of '>' signs and properly place the numbers in descending order:

```python
# Read the signs from file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N
# The smallest and largest numbers available
small, large = 1, N

# Stack to hold the indices for deferred assignment (for '>' signs)
deferred = []

for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        result[i] = small
        small += 1
        # Assign numbers to the indices in the deferred stack in descending order
        while deferred:
            result[deferred.pop()] = small
            small += 1
    else: # sign == '>'
        deferred.append(i)

# The last number should be placed at the last index
result[-1] = small
# If there are any deferred indices left, assign the remaining numbers in descending order
for i in reversed(deferred):
    small += 1
    result[i] = small

# Write the result to file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

In this fixed solution:
- We iterate over each sign.
- When we see a '<' sign, we assign the next smallest available number and also clear the stack by assigning the next smallest numbers in ascending order to the indices that were deferred.
- When we see a '>' sign, we simply add the index to the deferred stack to assign a number later.
- After processing all signs, we assign any remaining numbers to the deferred indices in ascending order.
- We write the constructed sequence to the output file.

This should provide us with the correct output, matching the expected sequence.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly handle the '>' sign. When a '>' sign is encountered, we are supposed to defer the placement of a number, but when a '<' is encountered, we should place all deferred numbers in descending order. The issue in the previous attempts was incorrect handling of this deferred placement.

Let's reimplement the solution with the proper logic:

1. Iterate over each character in the sign string.
2. When we see a '<' sign, we place the smallest available number at the current position and increment the smallest number counter.
3. When we see a '>' sign, we need to defer placement, so we simply continue without placing a number.
4. After processing all the signs, we will have a series of deferred placements for each '>' sign encountered. We then fill these in reverse order (since the last number should be the largest).

Here's the correct implementation:

```python
# Read the signs from file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
result = [None] * N
# The smallest number available for immediate placement
small = 1
# The largest number available for deferred placement
large = N

# Iterate through the signs, assigning numbers immediately for '<'
# For '>', defer placement by skipping assignment
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        result[i] = small
        small += 1

# The last number is placed after deciding on the last sign
# If the last sign was '<', we place the next smallest number
# If the last sign was '>', we place the largest number
result[N - 1] = small if signs[-1] == '<' else large

# Now, we need to assign numbers to slots that were deferred ('>' signs)
# We do this in reverse order starting from the end
for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1):
    if result[i] is None:
        result[i] = large
        large -= 1

# Write the result to file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This solution should provide the correct output, as it properly handles '>' signs by deferring their number assignment until after we've placed all the immediate ('<') numbers. We then fill in the deferred numbers in descending order, starting from the largest number available.
