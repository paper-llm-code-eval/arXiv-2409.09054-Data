Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare.

# Solution for the Compar game challenge

# Read the sign sequence from the input file

# Initializations
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N

        result[i] = i + 1
        while decreasing_stack:
            result[i] = max(result[i], decreasing_stack.pop() + 1)

# Handling the last number and possible remaining in the stack
result[-1] = N
while decreasing_stack:
    result[-1] = max(result[-1], decreasing_stack.pop() + 1)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution reads the signs from `compar.in`, processes them to reconstruct the sequence, and then writes the sequence to `compar.out`. The algorithm makes use of a 'decreasing_stack' to keep track of a sequence of decreasing numbers and efficiently assigns the correct number when the sequence breaks at each '<' sign.

Upon reviewing the output, it's evident that the original solution didn't correctly handle the stack of decreasing numbers, which is why many elements in the result are still 0. It's also clear that the logic used to populate the `result` list does not perform the correct assignments to the indices based on the signs in the input.

Let's go step by step to fix the logic:

1. We will maintain a stack to hold the indices of numbers that are in a decreasing sequence.
2. When we encounter a `<` sign, we need to resolve the stack by assigning the appropriate numbers in decreasing order starting from the current index + stack size.
3. Then, we assign the current index + 1 to the current position in the result.
4. At the end, if there are any indices left in the stack, we assign the remaining numbers in decreasing order.

Here is the fixed and correctly implemented solution:

```python
# Solution for the Compar game challenge

# Read the sign sequence from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initializations
N = len(signs) + 1  # The number of numbers is one more than the number of signs
result = [0] * N
stack = []

# Function to resolve the stack
def resolve_stack(stack, start):
    while stack:
        result[stack.pop()] = start
        start -= 1

# Generate the sequence by scanning the signs
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        resolve_stack(stack, i + 1)  # Resolve any decreasing sequence before a '<' sign
        result[i] = i + 1  # Assign the current number
    else:  # sign == '>'
        stack.append(i)  # Keep track of the start of a decreasing sequence

# Resolve any remaining numbers after the last sign
resolve_stack(stack, N)

# Assign the last number (which is always N)
result[-1] = N

# Write the result to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This implementation ensures that the numbers are assigned according to the specifications of the problem, and it should produce the correct output for any valid input. The use of the stack here is essential to keep track of the indices where the numbers are in a descending order and to be able to fill them in later when a `<` sign is encountered or at the end of the input.

The found output differs from the expected output because the code incorrectly handles the resolution of the stack. The function `resolve_stack` should assign decreasing numbers starting from the length of the stack plus the current index, not just starting from the current index + 1.

Let's correct the logic and re-implement the solution:

1. When we encounter a `>` sign, we push the index onto the stack.
2. When we encounter a `<` sign or reach the end of the input, we resolve the stack by assigning numbers in decreasing order starting from the current index + the size of the stack + 1.
3. We ensure that the last number in the sequence is always N.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
# Fixed solution for the Compar game challenge

# Read the sign sequence from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initializations
N = len(signs) + 1  # The number of numbers is one more than the number of signs
result = [0] * N
stack = []

# Function to resolve the stack
def resolve_stack(stack, next_value):
    while stack:
        result[stack.pop()] = next_value
        next_value -= 1

# Generate the sequence by scanning the signs
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '>':
        stack.append(i)  # Keep track of the start of a decreasing sequence
    elif sign == '<':
        resolve_stack(stack, i)  # Resolve any decreasing sequence before a '<' sign

# Resolve any remaining numbers after the last sign
resolve_stack(stack, N - 1)

# Assign the last number (which is always N)
result[-1] = N

# Write the result to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now produce the expected output, properly resolving the stack whenever a `<` sign is encountered or at the end of the input, thus ensuring the correct decreasing numbers are assigned. The last number is assigned outside of the loop since it's always known to be N.

The found output still differs from the expected output. The error in the solution is in the `resolve_stack()` function, where it does not correctly assign the values in decreasing order at the correct indices. The values should be assigned in decreasing order starting from the size of the stack plus the index of the '<' sign.

Let's correct the logic as follows:

1. When a '>' sign is encountered, push the index to the stack.
2. When a '<' sign is encountered or at the end of the signs, resolve the stack by popping indices and assigning values in decreasing order starting from the current index plus the size of the stack.
3. The last number is always N.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Corrected solution for the Compar game challenge

def resolve_stack(stack, start_value):
    while stack:
        index = stack.pop()
        result[index] = start_value
        start_value -= 1

# Read the sign sequence from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initializations
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N
stack = []

# Scan the signs and build the result
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '>':
        stack.append(i)
    else:  # sign == '<'
        stack.append(i)
        resolve_stack(stack, i + 1)

# Handle the remaining stack after scanning all signs
resolve_stack(stack, N)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution should now correctly build the sequence based on the signs, respecting the order implied by the '>' and '<' signs, and it should result in the expected output. The `resolve_stack()` function is correctly implemented to assign the sequence values in decreasing order.

The exit code 125 and the given error message suggest that the error is related to Docker rather than the Python code itself. The error indicates that the Docker daemon cannot start a stopped process, which is a system-level error unrelated to the script's logic or its execution. However, since I cannot directly address Docker daemon issues, we can instead focus on ensuring the Python code is correct.

Given the task, the goal is to reconstruct the initial sequence of numbers based on the given signs. To do this correctly, we can use a stack to keep track of indices that need numbers assigned to them. When we encounter a '<' sign, we resolve the stack by assigning decrementing numbers starting with the current index. When we encounter a '>' sign, we add the index to the stack to be resolved later.

Here is the re-implemented and fixed solution:

```python
# Corrected solution for the Compar game challenge

def resolve_stack(stack, start_value):
    """Given a stack of indices and a starting value, assign values in decreasing order starting from the top of the stack."""
    while stack:
        index = stack.pop()
        result[index] = start_value
        start_value -= 1

# Read the sign sequence from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initializations
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N
stack = []

# Create the sequence based on the signs
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '>':
        stack.append(i)  # Add the index to the stack to be resolved later
    else:  # sign == '<'
        # Resolve the stack with the current index being the smallest number
        # in the decreasing sequence
        resolve_stack(stack, i + len(stack) + 1)
        result[i] = i + 1  # Assign the value for '<'

# After processing all signs, resolve any remaining stack
resolve_stack(stack, N)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This code should now correctly build the sequence based on the signs, and it should operate correctly within the constraints of the Python language and runtime environment. If issues persist with Docker, they would need to be resolved at the system configuration or Docker configuration level, which is outside the scope of this Python task.

The differences in the expected and found result are due to an incorrect implementation of the stack resolution logic. The current implementation does not properly handle the distribution of the numbers based on the '>' and '<' signs.

To fix this, we need to change the strategy as follows:

1. Iterate through the signs and push the indices to the stack when encountering a '>'.
2. When we encounter a '<', we need to resolve the stack by popping indices from the stack and assigning them decreasing numbers starting with the current highest number available.
3. After processing all signs, we resolve the remaining stack which will contain decreasing sequence that ends with the last number.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the sign sequence from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initializations
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [None] * N
current_max = N  # Start assigning numbers from the highest number

# Stack to keep track of indices where the numbers need to be filled
stack = []

# Process the signs and fill in the numbers in the result list
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '>':
        stack.append(i)  # Add the index to the stack for later processing
    else:
        # When a '<' sign is encountered, resolve the current stack
        while stack:
            idx = stack.pop()  # Get the last index from the stack
            result[idx] = current_max  # Assign the current max number to this index
            current_max -= 1  # Decrease the current max number for the next number
        result[i] = current_max  # Assign the current max number for the '<' sign
        current_max -= 1  # Decrease the current max number for the next number

# Resolve the remaining stack after processing all signs
while stack:
    idx = stack.pop()
    result[idx] = current_max
    current_max -= 1

# The last number is always N; assign it if it's not already assigned
if result[-1] is None:
    result[-1] = current_max

# Write the result to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution should now correctly build the sequence based on the signs and produce the expected output, assigning numbers in the correct order and respecting the initial sequence's restrictions.

The found output is incorrect because the logic that assigns the numbers to the `result` list does not properly account for the order implied by the sequence of '>' and '<' signs. Specifically, the stack resolution logic does not correctly handle the assignment of numbers to positions representing a decreasing sequence ('>') followed by an increasing sequence ('<').

The bug in the previous solution is in how we handle the assignment of numbers when we encounter a '<' sign. We should not assign the current maximum number immediately upon encountering a '<' sign, but instead, we should resolve any pending '>' signs and then assign the smallest number available (which is the length of the stack plus 1) to the current position.

Let's correct the implementation:

1. Initialize the result list with None to indicate unassigned positions.
2. Iterate over the sign sequence.
3. For each '>' sign, push the current index onto the stack.
4. For each '<' sign, pop indices from the stack and assign decreasing numbers, then assign the next smallest available number to the current position.
5. After processing all the signs, assign decreasing numbers for any remaining indices in the stack.
6. Assign the last number in the sequence which is always N.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Corrected solution for the Compar game challenge

# Read the sign sequence from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initializations
N = len(signs) + 1
result = [None] * N
stack = []

# Iterate through the sign sequence and build the result
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '>':
        stack.append(i + 1)  # '+1' because indices are 1-based in the output
    else:  # sign == '<'
        # Assign the next smallest available number to the current position
        result[i] = i + 1 - len(stack)
        # Resolve the stack by assigning decreasing numbers
        while stack:
            result[stack.pop() - 1] = i + 1 - len(stack)

# The last number is always N
result[-1] = N

# Write the result to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)) + "\n")
```

This solution should now correctly handle the stack and assign numbers based on the sequence of '>' and '<' signs, resulting in the expected output and meeting the challenge requirements.
