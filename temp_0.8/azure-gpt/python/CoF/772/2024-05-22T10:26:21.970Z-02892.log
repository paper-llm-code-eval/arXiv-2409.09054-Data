The main issue with the previous solution is the calculation of the prime sum and the count of the digit `k`. It does not correctly calculate the sum of prime numbers among the first `n` terms because the predefined sequence's prime sum is not considered for terms within the predefined list length. Also, the counting of the digit `k` occurrences is not handled correctly within the predefined list length.

Let's fix these issues:

- Compute the sum of prime numbers within the predefined sequence up to `n` if `n` is less than or equal to the sequence length.
- Correctly count the digit `k` occurrences within the predefined sequence.
- Use the correct prime sum and `k` count from the predefined sequence before generating new terms.
- Ensure that the `p`-th term computation remains efficient by starting it from the last known sequence if `p` is greater than the predefined sequence length.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
# Efficient function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num in (2, 3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Function to generate the sequence up to n terms,
# calculate the sum of primes in the sequence and count
# the occurrences of the digit k
def process_sequence(n, k):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    prime_sum = sum(filter(is_prime, seq[:n]))
    k_count = sum(str(x).count(str(k)) for x in seq[:n])

    if n > len(seq):
        last_three = seq[-3:]
        for _ in range(len(seq), n):
            next_term = sum(last_three) % 10
            prime_sum += next_term if is_prime(next_term) else 0
            k_count += str(next_term).count(str(k))
            last_three = last_three[1:] + [next_term]

    return prime_sum, k_count, last_three[-1]

# Function to calculate the p-th term
def find_pth_term(p):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    if p <= len(seq):
        return seq[p - 1]

    last_three = seq[-3:]
    for _ in range(len(seq), p):
        next_term = sum(last_three) % 10
        last_three = last_three[1:] + [next_term]

    return last_three[-1]

# Reading from nr.in file and solving the problem

    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Process terms up to n and find p-th term

p_th_term = find_pth_term(p)

# Writing to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_th_term}\n")
```

This corrected code handles the prime sum and digit `k` count properly for terms within the predefined sequence before generating new terms. It should now provide the expected results for the input and constraints given.

The issue is that the prime sum calculation and k-counting are still incorrect. For the prime sum, the previous solution calculates the prime numbers only up to the length of the predefined sequence even when `n` is larger. For k-counting, it doesn't properly count occurrences of the digit `k` in each number of the sequence.

To address these issues, let's implement the following correct algorithm:

1. Initialize the sequence with the predefined numbers.
2. Use a correct method to extend the sequence up to `n` terms.
3. Calculate the prime sum and k-count correctly over the entire sequence up to `n` terms.
4. Compute the `p`-th term without needing to store the entire sequence.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Efficient function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def generate_sequence_and_calculate(n, k):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    prime_sum = 0
    k_count = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if i < len(seq):
            term = seq[i]
        else:
            term = (seq[-1] + seq[-2] + seq[-3]) % 10
            seq.append(term)
        
        # Count primes
        if is_prime(term):
            prime_sum += term
            
        # Count k occurrences
        k_count += str(term).count(str(k))

    return prime_sum, k_count, seq[-1]

def find_pth_term(p, last_term):
    if p <= len(seq):
        return seq[p - 1]

    last_three = [seq[-3], seq[-2], seq[-1]]
    for _ in range(len(seq), p):
        next_term = sum(last_three) % 10
        last_three = last_three[1:] + [next_term]

    return last_three[-1]

# Read the input
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Compute sequence up to n terms and calculate prime sum and k count
prime_sum, k_count, last_term = generate_sequence_and_calculate(n, k)
p_th_term = find_pth_term(p, last_term)

# Write the output
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_th_term}\n")
```

This code should now correctly calculate the sum of prime numbers, count the occurrences of `k`, and find the `p`-th term according to the sequence rule. It dynamically extends the sequence only as much as needed for the calculation of the `p`-th term, which is more efficient for large `p` values.

The error is caused by the use of an undefined variable `seq` in the `find_pth_term` function. To fix this, we should remove the check for `p <= len(seq)` because we have already calculated the last term of the sequence up to `n` and we can continue from there to find the `p`-th term.

Let's correct the `find_pth_term` function and update the code:

```python
def find_pth_term(p, last_term, last_three):
    # If p is within the range of predefined sequence, return directly.
    if p <= len(last_three):
        return last_three[p - 1]

    # Otherwise, calculate the p-th term starting from the last known term.
    for _ in range(len(last_three), p):
        next_term = sum(last_three) % 10
        last_three = last_three[1:] + [next_term]

    return last_three[-1]

# Generate the initial sequence up to 17 elements.
seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]

# Read the input
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Compute sequence up to n terms and calculate prime sum and k count
prime_sum, k_count, last_term = generate_sequence_and_calculate(n, k)

# Find p-th term, using the last term and the last three numbers of the sequence up to n
p_th_term = find_pth_term(p, last_term, seq[-3:] if n > len(seq) else seq[:n])

# Write the output
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_th_term}\n")
```

This updated solution should now run without errors and produce the correct output. The `find_pth_term` function now correctly continues from the last known sequence terms to calculate the `p`-th term. The sequence up to `n` is passed along with the last known term to this function for correct computation.

The "NameError" indicates that the function `generate_sequence_and_calculate` is not defined at the point where it is being called. This issue occurred because I omitted the definition of the `generate_sequence_and_calculate` function in the last code snippet. Let's correct the code by redefining the `generate_sequence_and_calculate` function and ensuring all necessary parts are included:

```python
# Efficient function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Function to generate the sequence up to n terms and calculate prime sum and k count
def generate_sequence_and_calculate(n, k):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    prime_sum = 0
    k_count = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if i >= len(seq):
            # Calculate the next term using the last 3 terms of the current sequence
            term = (seq[-1] + seq[-2] + seq[-3]) % 10
            seq.append(term)
        else:
            term = seq[i]

        # Count primes
        if is_prime(term):
            prime_sum += term
            
        # Count k occurrences
        k_count += str(term).count(str(k))

    return prime_sum, k_count, seq[-1], seq[-3:]

def find_pth_term(p, seq):
    # For p within the length of seq, return the term directly
    if p <= len(seq):
        return seq[p - 1]

    # Otherwise, calculate the p-th term starting from the last known three terms
    last_three = seq[-3:]
    for _ in range(len(seq), p):
        next_term = sum(last_three) % 10
        last_three = last_three[1:] + [next_term]
    return last_three[-1]

# Read the input
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Compute sequence up to n terms and calculate prime sum and k count
prime_sum, k_count, last_term, last_three = generate_sequence_and_calculate(n, k)

# Find p-th term, using the last three numbers of the sequence up to n
p_th_term = find_pth_term(p, last_three if n > len(seq) else seq[:n])

# Write the output
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_th_term}\n")
```

This corrected code includes the definition of the `generate_sequence_and_calculate` function and correctly passes the last three terms of the sequence to the `find_pth_term` function for cases where `p` is larger than the number of precomputed terms. The code should now run successfully and produce the correct output according to the input and problem constraints.

The issue arises because the variable `seq` is not defined in the global scope when used in the line `p_th_term = find_pth_term(p, last_three if n > len(seq) else seq[:n])`. The variable `seq` was only defined within the `generate_sequence_and_calculate` function and hence is not accessible outside of it. To fix this, we should use the `last_three` variable directly, which is already returned by the `generate_sequence_and_calculate` function and does not require the use of `seq`.

Here's the corrected and complete solution:

```python
# Efficient function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True

    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Function to generate the sequence up to n terms and calculate prime sum and k count
def generate_sequence_and_calculate(n, k):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    prime_sum = 0
    k_count = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if i >= len(seq):
            term = (seq[-1] + seq[-2] + seq[-3]) % 10
            seq.append(term)
        else:
            term = seq[i]

        if is_prime(term):
            prime_sum += term
            
        k_count += str(term).count(str(k))

    return prime_sum, k_count, seq[-1], seq[-3:]

# Function to calculate the p-th term
def find_pth_term(p, last_three):
    for _ in range(len(last_three) + 3, p + 1):
        next_term = sum(last_three) % 10
        last_three = last_three[1:] + [next_term]
    return last_three[-1]

# Read the input
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Compute sequence up to n terms and calculate prime sum and k count
prime_sum, k_count, _, last_three = generate_sequence_and_calculate(n, k)

# Find p-th term, no need to check the length as `last_three` is the correct starting point
p_th_term = find_pth_term(p, last_three)

# Write the output
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_th_term}\n")

It appears that my previous solutions contained several errors, including the incorrect calculation of prime sums and the incorrect count of digit `k`. Also, the calculation for the `p`-th term of the sequence did not provide the expected result. I will correct the entire solution here by:

- Carefully generating the sequence.
- Correctly calculating the sum of prime numbers among the first `n` terms.
- Accurately counting the occurrences of digit `k` among the first `n` terms.
- Properly finding the `p`-th term of the sequence.

Here is the revised solution:

    return True

# Function to generate the sequence and perform calculations

In this solution, the prime sum is initiated according to the given starting sequence, and the k count is calculated for the initial terms if `n` is less than or equal to the length of the starting sequence. If `n` is greater, the sequence is extended, and calculations are updated accordingly. The `p`-th term is also computed correctly whether `p` is within the starting sequence or beyond it. This solution should now yield the correct expected output.
