This Python code defines a function to check for prime numbers and a function to generate the series and calculate the three outputs required by the problem statement: the sum of prime numbers among the first `n` terms, the number of occurrences of digit `k`, and the `p`-th term of the series. The `main` function reads from `nr.in`, executes the calculations, and writes the results to `nr.out`. The series is generated following the rule observed from the provided sequence, where each new term is the sum of the digits found 8 and 5 positions before the current index, modulo 10.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and the found result, it's clear there are some issues with the initial code. Let's go through the points that may cause the discrepancy:

1. The function `generate_series` seems to assume that all terms after the 17th term are generated by adding the term 8 places back and the term 5 places back, and then taking the last digit of the result. This may not be the correct rule for generating the series.

2. The `is_prime` function is correct, but the application of finding prime numbers should be applied only to unique digits (0-9) since the series is cyclic with respect to the last digit.

3. The count for the digit `k` should be done correctly across all `n` terms.

4. For the `p`-th element, the element should be directly calculated from the pattern, considering that the pattern repeats every 60 terms.

Let's correct these issues:

1. Correct the generation rule based on the observed pattern. The sequence is Fibonacci-like, but only the last digit of each term is kept. The series repeats every 60 terms due to mod 10 operation. We'll use this property to find the `p`-th term efficiently.

2. Since the series cycles every 60 terms, we only need to calculate the first 60 terms to determine the entire series.

3. We'll correct the prime sum calculation by only considering the unique digits.

4. We'll correct the digit count by iterating through the sequence correctly.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def generate_series(n, k, p):
    initial_terms = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    prime_sum = 0
    k_count = 0
    series = initial_terms.copy()
    p_element = None

    # Calculate unique primes sum
    primes = [num for num in range(10) if is_prime(num)]
    prime_sum = sum(primes)

    # Generate the first 60 terms of the series, since it repeats every 60 terms due to mod 10
    for i in range(17, 60):
        next_term = (series[i - 1] + series[i - 2]) % 10
        series.append(next_term)

    # Count occurrences of digit k
    k_count = sum(str(num).count(str(k)) for num in series[:n])

    # The series repeats every 60 terms, use this to find the p-th term
    p_element = series[(p - 1) % 60]

    return prime_sum, k_count, p_element

def main():
    with open("nr.in", "r") as file:
        n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

    prime_sum, k_count, p_element = generate_series(n, k, p)

    with open("nr.out", "w") as file:
        file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_element}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should now provide the correct outputs for the given inputs. It correctly computes the sum of primes in the series, the count of digit `k` among the first `n` terms, and finds the `p`-th term efficiently by leveraging the repeating pattern of the series.

Upon reviewing the previous solution, it appears that the prime sum was incorrectly calculated based on a misunderstanding of the problem requirements. The mistake is in calculating the sum of primes only once using the unique digits from 0 to 9. However, the sum of primes should be calculated for the first `n` terms of the sequence.

Let's address the bug and rewrite the solution:

1. The prime sum needs to be recalculated for the first `n` terms of the series, not just based on the unique digits.

2. The count of digit `k` among the first `n` terms of the series is correct in the previous solution.

3. The `p`-th term calculation is correctly using the repeating pattern of the series.

Here's the revised solution, with the correct calculation for the prime sum:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def generate_series(n, k, p):
    series = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    prime_sum = 0
    k_count = 0

    # Extend the series up to the nth term using the observed rule
    while len(series) < n:
        next_term = (series[-1] + series[-2]) % 10
        series.append(next_term)

    # Calculate the sum of prime numbers among the first n terms
    prime_sum = sum(num for num in series[:n] if is_prime(num))

    # Count occurrences of digit k among the first n terms
    k_count = sum(str(num).count(str(k)) for num in series[:n])

    # The p-th term is determined using the repeat pattern every 60 terms
    # Generate the entire sequence of 60 terms first
    for i in range(17, 60):
        series.append((series[-1] + series[-2]) % 10)

    # Use modulo to determine the p-th term from the sequence
    p_element = series[(p - 1) % 60]

    return prime_sum, k_count, p_element

def main():
    with open("nr.in", "r") as file:
        n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

    prime_sum, k_count, p_element = generate_series(n, k, p)

    with open("nr.out", "w") as file:
        file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_element}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution should now correctly calculate the prime sum by iterating through the first `n` terms of the series and checking each term for primality. The digit count and `p`-th term calculations remain the same, as they were correct in the previous solution. This should provide the expected output for the given input.
