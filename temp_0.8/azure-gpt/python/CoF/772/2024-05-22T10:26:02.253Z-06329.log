Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Define helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Calculate sequence using memoization

    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 17:
        return memo[n]

    term = (calc_sequence(n - 16, memo) + calc_sequence(n - 8, memo) + calc_sequence(n - 5, memo)) % 10
    memo[n] = term
    return term

# Read from nr.in file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Prepare variables
memo = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 5, 5: 8, 6: 3, 7: 1, 8: 4, 9: 5, 10: 9, 11: 4, 12: 3, 13: 7, 14: 0, 15: 7, 16: 7, 17: 4}

k_count = 0

# Calculate sum of primes and count of digit k in the first n terms
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    term = calc_sequence(i, memo)
    if is_prime(term):

# Write to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

The above code calculates the sequence using recursion with memoization to store previously calculated terms, checks each term for primality, counts occurrences of digit k, and calculates the p-th term efficiently. It reads from 'nr.in' and writes the results to 'nr.out'.

It seems there is a bug in the original implementation. Specifically, the `calc_sequence` function is incorrect. The sequence appears to be calculated based on some pattern that involves previous elements, but the correct pattern has not been given or deduced correctly.

By looking at the given sequence:
$1$, $2$, $3$, $5$, $8$, $3$, $1$, $4$, $5$, $9$, $4$, $3$, $7$, $0$, $7$, $7$, $4$,...

We observe a Fibonacci pattern that repeats every 8 numbers (due to the modulo operation):

$1$ (1st Fibonacci number),
$2$ (2nd Fibonacci number),
$3$ (3rd Fibonacci number),
$5$ (4th Fibonacci number),
$8$ (5th Fibonacci number),
$3$ (6th Fibonacci number is 13, which is $3$ when taken modulo $10$),
...

Based on this observation, we can deduce that every 8th Fibonacci number's last digit repeats. Thus, we can construct the sequence of the last digits of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10, and use this sequence to find the $p$-th term efficiently without needing to compute the entire Fibonacci sequence.

Let's rewrite the solution, taking into account the pattern we've noticed:

```python
# Define helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Define function to get the p-th term efficiently
def get_pth_term(p):
    fib_last_digits = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4]
    return fib_last_digits[(p - 1) % 8]

# Read from nr.in file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Prepare variables
fib_last_digits = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4]
prime_sum = 0
k_count = 0

# Calculate sum of primes and count of digit k in the first n terms
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    term = fib_last_digits[(i - 1) % 8]
    if is_prime(term):
        prime_sum += term
    k_count += str(term).count(str(k))

# Get the p-th term using the efficient function
p_term = get_pth_term(p)

# Write to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This revised solution makes use of the observed pattern to solve the problem more efficiently and correctly. The `get_pth_term` function is now used to directly obtain the $p$-th term based on the repeating last digits of the Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. This should give us the correct results as expected.

Upon re-evaluating the problem and the incorrect output, it becomes clear that the assumption about the sequence being a simple Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 is incorrect. Given the initial sequence, the pattern is not immediately obvious, as the terms do not solely depend on the typical Fibonacci sequence rules.

Given the initial set of numbers, and the expected output, let's look at the pattern more closely. Intuitively, the sequence seems to repeat after a certain number of terms. By examining the given numbers and their indices, we can try to derive a rule for generating the sequence.

A potential rule could be that the sequence is a sum of the previous terms, modulo 10. However, we need to figure out exactly which terms are being summed. By observing the sequence, it seems that at the 8th term (which is 4), we start to see numbers that could be the result of adding previous numbers from the sequence and taking the modulo 10 of the result.

Let's deduce the rule based on the terms given:
- The 8th term (4) could be the sum of the 1st and 7th terms (1 + 1), modulo 10.
- The 9th term (5) could be the sum of the 2nd and 8th terms (2 + 4), modulo 10.
- Following this pattern, each term could be the sum of the term 7 places before it and the term immediately before it, modulo 10.

We can test this hypothesis for the first few terms beyond those given and check if they match the expected output.

Let's correct the implementation based on this new insight and write the solution:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Helper function to generate the sequence and find required values
def generate_sequence(n, k):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4]  # first 8 terms as given in the problem
    prime_sum = 0
    k_count = 0

    for i in range(8, n):
        # Each new term is the sum of the term 7 places before it and the term immediately before it, modulo 10
        next_term = (sequence[i-7] + sequence[i-1]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
    
    for i in range(n):
        if is_prime(sequence[i]):
            prime_sum += sequence[i]
        if sequence[i] == k:
            k_count += 1

    return prime_sum, k_count, sequence[p-1]

# Read from nr.in file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence and calculate the required values
prime_sum, k_count, p_term = generate_sequence(n, k)

# Write to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution now incorporates a revised rule for generating the sequence based on the hypothesis we derived. We generate the first `n` terms of the sequence, calculate the sum of prime numbers, count the occurrences of digit `k`, and find the `p`-th term.

Testing this solution with the input data:
```
19 5 26
```
should now produce the expected output:
```

The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError: list index out of range` which occurs when we try to access the `p`-th term of the sequence using `sequence[p-1]`. This happens because the sequence list only contains the first `n` elements, but `p` can be much larger than `n`. Since the sequence is repetitive after a certain number of terms, we do not need to generate all terms up to `p`. We can use the fact that the sequence repeats every 16 terms (from the given terms, we notice that terms 9 to 16 are a sum of the previous 8 terms, suggesting a cycle of length 16).

We can fix the program by correctly addressing the calculation of the `p`-th term to avoid accessing out-of-range indices and by computing the repetitive pattern correctly for the number of occurrences of `k`.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Helper function to generate the first 16 elements of the sequence
def generate_first_16():
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7]
    for i in range(16, 32):
        next_term = (sequence[i-16] + sequence[i-8]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
    return sequence[:16]

# Function to calculate the sum of prime numbers and the number of occurrences of k
def calculate_values(sequence, n, k):
    prime_sum = 0
    k_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if is_prime(sequence[i]):
            prime_sum += sequence[i]
        if sequence[i] == k:
            k_count += 1
    return prime_sum, k_count

# Read from nr.in file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Generate the first 16 elements of the sequence
sequence_16 = generate_first_16()

# Calculate prime_sum and k_count for the first n terms
prime_sum, k_count = calculate_values(sequence_16 * (n // 16 + 1), n, k)

# Calculate the p-th term, taking into account the repetition every 16 terms
p_term = sequence_16[(p-1) % 16]

# Write to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution now correctly generates the first 16 elements of the sequence which are then used to calculate the sum of prime numbers and count the occurrences of digit `k` within the first `n` terms. It also correctly calculates the `p`-th term by using the modulo operation on `p` with the length of the sequence cycle, which is 16. This should provide the correct output without running into any out-of-range errors.

The error in the output is because the current implementation does not handle the count of digit `k` correctly. The implementation multiplies the initial sequence pattern by `(n // 16 + 1)` which does not precisely reflect the number of occurrences of `k` in the first `n` terms. It could potentially count extra occurrences from the repeated patterns that go beyond the `n` terms.

We need to count occurrences of `k` only within the first `n` terms and not in the repeated patterns.

Let's rewrite the solution to address this by iterating exactly `n` times and counting occurrences of `k` correctly. Furthermore, we can optimize the code to not repeat the sequence 16 times, which could lead to counting digits of `k` that are outside the first `n` terms when `n` is not a multiple of 16.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate the full sequence up to n terms
def generate_sequence(n):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append((sequence[-8] + sequence[-1]) % 10)
    return sequence

# Read from nr.in file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate full sequence up to n terms
sequence = generate_sequence(n)

# Calculate prime sum and k count
prime_sum = sum(filter(is_prime, sequence[:n]))
k_count = ''.join(map(str, sequence[:n])).count(str(k))

# Calculate the p-th term
# Since the sequence repeats every 16 terms, we can use modulo to find the p-th term
p_term = sequence[(p - 1) % 16]

# Write to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution will now correctly count the occurrences of `k` within the first `n` terms by generating only the required terms. It also calculates the `p`-th term in the sequence correctly by using the repeating pattern of length 16. Testing this solution with the input data should now produce the expected output.

Upon closer examination of the expected and found output, we can see that the count of digit `k` is now correct (3 occurrences of digit `5`), but the sum of prime numbers and the p-th term are still incorrect. The error suggests that there might be an issue with either the prime checking function or the way the sequence is generated.

The provided sequence appears to have a repeating pattern every 16 terms, and the next term in the sequence is the sum of the 1st and 7th previous values, modulo 10. 

Given the initial 16 terms:
$1$, $2$, $3$, $5$, $8$, $3$, $1$, $4$, $5$, $9$, $4$, $3$, $7$, $0$, $7$, $7$.

Let's implement the solution with the correct generation of terms and prime sum calculations:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate the sequence up to n terms
def generate_sequence(n):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7]
    for _ in range(16, n):  # Start iterating from the 17th term
        next_term = (sequence[-8] + sequence[-1]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
    return sequence

# Read from nr.in file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence up to n terms
sequence = generate_sequence(n)

# Calculate prime sum and k count
prime_sum = sum(filter(is_prime, sequence[:n]))
k_count = ''.join(map(str, sequence[:n])).count(str(k))

# Calculate the p-th term
# Since the sequence repeats every 16 terms, we can use modulo to find the p-th term
p_term = sequence[(p - 1) % 16]

# Write to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution correctly handles the generation of the sequence. The `generate_sequence` function now properly extends the sequence beyond the initial 16 terms based on the discovered pattern. The prime sum is calculated by filtering the sequence to only include prime numbers, and then summing those values. The count of `k` is determined by converting the sequence to a string and counting the occurrences of `k`. The p-th term is found by using the modulo operation on `p - 1` with the length of the repeating pattern, which is 16. This should provide the expected output.

The issue with the current solution is that the sum of prime numbers is incorrect, and the p-th term is also incorrect. The prime number calculation error is likely due to the `is_prime` function or how we're using it. The error with the p-th term suggests that we might not be correctly calculating the sequence or misunderstanding the pattern.

Let's fix the prime number sum calculation first. It seems that the `is_prime` function is working correctly, but we need to ensure that we only consider the unique prime numbers within the sequence pattern since the pattern repeats every 16 terms. Moreover, the prime sum should be calculated for the first `n` terms, not based on uniqueness.

For the p-th term, we'll need to re-evaluate how we're generating the sequence. Given the expected output, the p-th term (`p = 26`) should be `8`, but our function is returning `9`. This indicates that we're not correctly following the pattern for generating new terms.

Upon careful inspection of the original sequence, we can find that the pattern is not simply a repetition of the first 16 terms, but rather it's a sliding window where each term is the sum of the 1st and 7th elements before it (starting from the 8th term).

Here is the corrected solution considering these insights:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate the sequence up to n terms
def generate_sequence(n, p):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4]
    if p > n:  # Extend the sequence to at least p terms if p > n
        n = p
    while len(sequence) < n:
        next_term = (sequence[-8] + sequence[-1]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
    return sequence

# Read from nr.in file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence to the max of n or p terms
sequence = generate_sequence(n, p)

# Calculate prime sum and k count for the first n terms
prime_sum = sum(el for el in sequence[:n] if is_prime(el))
k_count = str(sequence[:n]).count(str(k))

# Calculate the p-th term, which is already in the sequence list
p_term = sequence[p - 1]

# Write to nr.out file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{k_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the sum of primes within the first `n` terms, count the occurrences of the digit `k`, and find the `p`-th term according to the pattern of the sequence. Testing this solution with the input data should produce the expected output.
