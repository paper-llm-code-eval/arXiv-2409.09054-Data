Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Below is the Python code for the described challenge. It reads the input from `nr.in` and writes the output to `nr.out`. The given sequence does not follow a simple mathematical pattern, but for the sake of this challenge, we'll assume it repeats every 16 numbers (1-7-4) as given in the initial terms:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_digit_occurrences(sequence, digit):
    return sum(str(num).count(str(digit)) for num in sequence)

def generate_sequence(n):
    base_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    sequence = base_sequence * (n // len(base_sequence)) + base_sequence[:n % len(base_sequence)]
    return sequence

def main():
    with open("nr.in", "r") as input_file:
        n, k, p = map(int, input_file.readline().strip().split())

    sequence = generate_sequence(n)
    prime_sum = sum(num for num in sequence if is_prime(num))
    k_occurrences = count_digit_occurrences(sequence, k)
    pth_term = sequence[(p - 1) % len(sequence)]

    with open("nr.out", "w") as output_file:
        output_file.write(f'{prime_sum}\n{k_occurrences}\n{pth_term}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines efficient helper functions to check for primes, count digit occurrences, and generate the sequence. The sequence generator creates a list of numbers following the pattern given in the challenge example, repeating as necessary to reach the required length `n`. The `main` function orchestrates reading the input, performing calculations, and writing the output.

Upon reviewing the code and its results, it seems that the original solution made an incorrect assumption about the pattern of the sequence. The pattern does not simply repeat every 16 numbers; rather, it appears to be a sequence where each term after the initial ones is the sum of the last two digits of the previous term.

Based on this observation, we need to rewrite the sequence generation logic as follows:

1. Initialize the sequence with the given first 17 terms.
2. Generate new terms by summing the last two digits of the previous term and append them to the sequence until we have generated `n` terms.

This should correct the logic to match the pattern suggested by the provided series. Now let's rewrite the solution with these fixes applied.

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_digit_occurrences(sequence, digit):
    """Count occurrences of the digit in the sequence."""
    return sum(str(num).count(str(digit)) for num in sequence)

def generate_sequence(n):
    """Generate the sequence up to the nth term."""
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        next_term = (sequence[-2] + sequence[-1]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
    return sequence

def main():
    with open("nr.in", "r") as input_file:
        n, k, p = map(int, input_file.readline().strip().split())

    sequence = generate_sequence(n)
    prime_sum = sum(num for num in sequence[:n] if is_prime(num))
    k_occurrences = count_digit_occurrences(sequence[:n], k)
    pth_term = sequence[(p - 1) % len(sequence)]

    with open("nr.out", "w") as output_file:
        output_file.write(f'{prime_sum}\n{k_occurrences}\n{pth_term}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised code should generate the correct sequence and calculate the prime sum, digit occurrences, and nth term according to the rules inferred from the initial terms. The results should now match the expected output for the given input.

The differences between the expected and found result are due to the incorrect handling of the calculation for the p-th term of the sequence. The code incorrectly assumes that the p-th term can be found by taking the modulo of `p` with the length of the generated sequence. However, this is incorrect because the sequence generation logic continues beyond the initial 17 numbers by adding the last two digits of the previous number. Therefore, the sequence does not repeat cyclically within the first 17 terms.

To fix the solution, I need to ensure that the sequence is correctly generated up to the p-th term, not just the first `n` terms. This requires modifying the sequence generation to be able to handle large `p` values efficiently without generating all terms up to `p`.

Here is the rewritten solution with the necessary fix:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_digit_occurrences(n, sequence, digit):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if str(sequence[i]).count(str(digit)):
            count += 1
    return count

def generate_sequence(n, p):
    base_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    # Extend the base sequence for the first n terms
    sequence = base_sequence.copy()
    for _ in range(n - len(base_sequence)):
        next_term = (sequence[-2] + sequence[-1]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
    
    # Calculate p-th term without generating the entire sequence
    if p <= len(sequence):
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1]
    else:
        pth_term = sequence[(p - 1) % len(base_sequence)]

    return sequence, pth_term

def main():
    with open("nr.in", "r") as input_file:
        n, k, p = map(int, input_file.readline().strip().split())

    sequence, pth_term = generate_sequence(n, p)
    prime_sum = sum(num for num in sequence[:n] if is_prime(num))
    k_occurrences = count_digit_occurrences(n, sequence, k)

    with open("nr.out", "w") as output_file:
        output_file.write(f'{prime_sum}\n{k_occurrences}\n{pth_term}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version, the program generates the full sequence up to `n` terms to calculate the prime sum and digit occurrences. For the p-th term, it calculates the position within the base repeating pattern to avoid generating all terms up to `p`, which could be very large. This solution should now provide the expected results for the given input data.

The program still outputs the incorrect p-th term. The error lies in the incorrect assumption that the p-th term can be derived from the pattern of the first 17 numbers. This is incorrect because, after the initial 17 terms, each subsequent term is generated by summing the last two digits of the previous term, and this process does not produce a simple repeatable pattern that we can use to directly calculate the p-th term for large values of p without generating all terms up to p.

To correct this, we must generate the sequence up to the p-th term. However, for large values of p, generating each term individually would be inefficient. We can optimize the generation by observing that the sequence eventually falls into a cycle, as it's based on the last two digits, and there are only 100 possible combinations of two digits (00 to 99).

We will first generate the first 17 terms and then continue until we detect a cycle. Once we detect the cycle, we can calculate the p-th term without generating the entire sequence up to p.

Here is the updated solution:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_digit_occurrences(sequence, n, digit):
    return sum(str(x).count(str(digit)) for x in sequence[:n])

def find_cycle(sequence):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(sequence):
        if num in seen:
            return seen[num], i   # start and end of the cycle
        seen[num] = i
    return None

def generate_sequence(n, p):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    cycle = None
    i = 16
    while len(sequence) < n or (p > i and not cycle):
        next_term = (sequence[-2] + sequence[-1]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
        i += 1
        if not cycle:
            cycle = find_cycle(sequence)
    return sequence, cycle

def main():
    with open('nr.in', 'r') as input_file:
        n, k, p = map(int, input_file.readline().split())
    
    sequence, cycle = generate_sequence(n, p)
    prime_sum = sum(filter(is_prime, sequence[:n]))
    k_occurrences = count_digit_occurrences(sequence, n, k)
    pth_term = sequence[p-1] if p <= len(sequence) else sequence[cycle[0] + (p - cycle[0] - 1) % (cycle[1] - cycle[0])]

    with open('nr.out', 'w') as output_file:
        output_file.write(f'{prime_sum}\n{k_occurrences}\n{pth_term}\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code should now correctly output the p-th term by detecting the cycle in the sequence and calculating the term using the cycle properties. The prime sum and digit occurrences are calculated straightforwardly. The solution should now provide the expected results for the given input data.
