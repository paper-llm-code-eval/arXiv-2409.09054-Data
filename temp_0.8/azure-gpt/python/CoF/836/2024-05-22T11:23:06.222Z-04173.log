Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Restricții și precizări

The initial solution calculated the power of each element incorrectly because it didn't properly account for the number of sequences where the current element is the maximum. The calculation should consider the left and right extensions of each subsequence to identify where the current element is the largest. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def calculate_max_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    power = [1] * n  # Start with 1 because each element is a subsequence by itself
    left = [1] * n
    right = [1] * n

    # Calculate left extensions for each element
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            left[i] = left[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            left[i] = 1

    # Calculate right extensions for each element
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            right[i] = right[i + 1] + 1
        else:
            right[i] = 1

    # Calculate the power of each element
    for i in range(n):
        power[i] += right[i] - 1
        if i > 0 and arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            power[i] += left[i - 1] - 1

    max_power = max(power)
    count = power.count(max_power)

    return max_power, count

# Read input file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate max power and count of elements with max power
max_power, max_count = calculate_max_power(sequence)

# Write output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_power}\n{max_count}\n')
```

This corrected version should calculate the left and right extensions for each element correctly and use them to determine the number of sequences where the element is the largest. The result is then written to 'maxp.out' as expected.

It appears the previous solution did not correctly calculate the power of each element because it failed to account for all subsequences in which an element is the maximum and strictly greater than the others. We need to reconsider the way we calculate the power of an element, specifically by using a more sophisticated method for counting the subsequences where each element is the maximum.

Let's analyze the sample input to understand what the correct output of `12` for the number `5` in the sequence means. For the number `5` at index `3`, the subsequences where it is the maximum are as follows:

- Subsequences which start at `5` and end with any of the following elements: `1`, `2`, `2`. This gives us `3` subsequences.
- Subsequences which start before `5` at `4`, and end with any of the following elements: `1`, `2`, `2`. This gives us an additional `3` subsequences.
- Subsequences which start before `5` at `3`, and end with any of the following elements: `1`, `2`, `2`. This gives us yet another `3` subsequences.
- Subsequences which start before `5` at `9`, and end with any of the following elements: `1`, `2`, `2`. This gives us the last `3` subsequences.

Adding them up, there are `12` subsequences where `5` is the maximum. 

Given the analysis, we can see that the power of an element is the product of:
- The number of elements to the left that are less than the current element, plus one for the element itself
- The number of elements to the right that are less than or equal to the current element

Here is the corrected solution, which calculates the power for all elements and finds the maximum power and its frequency:

```python
def calculate_max_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    left = [0] * n
    right = [0] * n
    
    # Calculate left
    for i in range(n):
        left[i] = 1  # Each element is a subsequence itself
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] < arr[i]:
            left[i] += left[j]
            j -= left[j]

    # Calculate right
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right[i] = 1  # Each element is a subsequence itself
        j = i + 1
        while j < n and arr[j] <= arr[i]:
            right[i] += right[j]
            j += right[j]

    # Calculate the power for each element, find max power and count
    max_power = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        power = left[i] * right[i]
        if power > max_power:
            max_power = power
            count = 1
        elif power == max_power:
            count += 1

    return max_power, count

# Read input file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate max power and count of elements with max power
max_power, max_count = calculate_max_power(sequence)

# Write output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_power}\n{max_count}\n')
```

This solution should match the expected output, correctly calculating the maximum power and the number of elements that have this maximum power.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Upon reviewing the previous solution and the newly provided test case, it's clear that the solution needs to correctly handle cases where there are equal elements adjacent to the current element being analyzed. When such cases occur, the current element may not be the maximum in all the subsequences created by extending to its left and right.

The correct approach involves finding the number of subsequences where an element is the maximum and not included in the same subsequence with any other equal or larger elements to its right or left. To do this, we need to use a stack data structure to store the indices of the elements in descending order and pop them when we find a larger element. This method will allow us to calculate the number of subsequences where each element is the largest.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct approach:

```python
def calculate_max_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    stack = []
    power = [0] * n

    # Calculate the power for each element
    for i in range(n):
        # Count the number of subsequences to the left
        left_count = 1
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            left_count += stack.pop()[1]
        stack.append((i, left_count))

    stack.clear()

    # Calculate the power for each element from right to left
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # Count the number of subsequences to the right
        right_count = 1
        while stack and arr[stack[-1][0]] < arr[i]:
            right_count += stack.pop()[1]
        power[i] += (right_count + (0 if not stack else stack[-1][1] - 1))

        # If the stack is not empty and the current element is the same as 
        # the next element in the stack, merge their counts
        if stack and arr[stack[-1][0]] == arr[i]:
            _, count = stack.pop()
            right_count += count

        stack.append((i, right_count))

    # Find the max power and the count of the elements with this power
    max_power = max(power)
    max_count = power.count(max_power)

    return max_power, max_count

# Read input file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate max power and count of elements with max power
max_power, max_count = calculate_max_power(sequence)

# Write output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_power}\n{max_count}\n')
```

This updated solution should properly count the number of subsequences where each element is the largest and not just extend blindly to the left and right. It also merges counts of equal elements to avoid double-counting their subsequences. This should now match the expected output given the new input.

The error indicates that the program is trying to use a tuple as an index when accessing `arr[stack[-1]]`. This is because the stack is storing tuples `(index, count)` and not just indices. To fix this, we need to access the first element of the tuple, which represents the index, when trying to access elements of `arr` using indices from the stack.

Let's fix the code and ensure we are using the index part of the tuple when we are accessing `arr`:

```python
def calculate_max_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    stack = []
    power = [0] * n

    # Calculate the power for each element
    for i in range(n):
        # Count the number of subsequences to the left
        left_count = 1
        while stack and arr[stack[-1][0]] <= arr[i]:
            _, count = stack.pop()
            left_count += count
        stack.append((i, left_count))

    stack.clear()

    # Calculate the power for each element from right to left
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # Count the number of subsequences to the right
        right_count = 1
        while stack and arr[stack[-1][0]] < arr[i]:
            _, count = stack.pop()
            right_count += count
        power[i] += (right_count + (0 if not stack else stack[-1][1] - 1))

        # If the stack is not empty and the current element is the same as 
        # the next element in the stack, merge their counts
        if stack and arr[stack[-1][0]] == arr[i]:
            _, count = stack.pop()
            right_count += count

        stack.append((i, right_count))

    # Find the max power and the count of the elements with this power
    max_power = max(power)
    max_count = power.count(max_power)

    return max_power, max_count

# Read input file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate max power and count of elements with max power
max_power, max_count = calculate_max_power(sequence)

# Write output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_power}\n{max_count}\n')
```

In this fix, whenever we use the stack to access an element of the array (i.e., `arr[stack[-1][0]]`), we make sure to specify the `[0]` index to get the actual integer index. This code should now run without the previous error and produce the correct output.

To correct the solution, we need to properly calculate the power of each element by considering the subsequences where it is the maximum. The power calculation must account for sequences stretching to the left and right of each element, ensuring that the element is the largest within those sequences.

The power of an element at index `i` can be calculated by the formula:

`power[i] = (number of elements to the left smaller than a[i] + 1) * (number of elements to the right smaller or equal to a[i] + 1)`

Here is the correct algorithm:

1. Iterate through the array from left to right and maintain a monotone decreasing stack of elements. For each element `a[i]`, we will pop from the stack while the current element is greater than the stack's top. Each pop operation counts the number of smaller elements to the left of `a[i]`.
2. Do the same from right to left to count the number of smaller or equal elements to the right of `a[i]`.
3. Multiply the counts from step 1 and 2 to get the power of each `a[i]`.
4. Finally, find the maximum power and count the number of times it occurs.

Here's the corrected and optimized Python code:

```python
def calculate_max_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    max_power = 0
    max_count = 0

    # Arrays to store the count of smaller elements to the left and right
    smaller_to_left = [0] * n
    smaller_or_equal_to_right = [0] * n

    # Monotone decreasing stack for finding counts of smaller elements to the left
    stack_left = []
    for i in range(n):
        count = 1
        while stack_left and arr[stack_left[-1]] < arr[i]:
            count += smaller_to_left[stack_left[-1]]
            stack_left.pop()
        smaller_to_left[i] = count
        stack_left.append(i)

    # Monotone decreasing stack for finding counts of smaller or equal elements to the right
    stack_right = []
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        count = 1
        while stack_right and arr[stack_right[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            count += smaller_or_equal_to_right[stack_right[-1]]
            stack_right.pop()
        smaller_or_equal_to_right[i] = count
        stack_right.append(i)

    # Calculate the power for each element and the maximum power
    for i in range(n):
        power = smaller_to_left[i] * smaller_or_equal_to_right[i]
        if power > max_power:
            max_power = power
            max_count = 1
        elif power == max_power:
            max_count += 1

    return max_power, max_count

# Read input file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate max power and count of elements with max power
max_power, max_count = calculate_max_power(sequence)

# Write output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_power}\n{max_count}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the power of each element and write the correct output to `maxp.out`.
