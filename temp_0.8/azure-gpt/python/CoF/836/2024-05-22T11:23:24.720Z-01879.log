Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

This solution uses a stack to efficiently track the number of sequences a given element is the maximum of. For each element, it calculates the number of sequences to the left and right that can combine with it, excluding those where it is not the maximum. Then it computes the power by multiplying these counts. Finally, it finds the maximum power and counts how many times it occurs in the array.

The previous solution doesn't correctly account for the number of sequences in which an element is the strict maximum. Specifically, the lines that compute `power[i]` using `count_left` and `count_right` are incorrect because they don't properly handle the sequences where `arr[i]` is not the maximum when considering elements to the left. The conditional check within the loop incorrectly sets the power to zero for elements that are not the maximum up to that point, which is not a part of the problem statement.

Let's correct the solution by calculating the number of sequences correctly. We should find subsequences where the current element is strictly greater than all other elements before it and after it. We can use a monotonic stack to efficiently compute this.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_power(arr):
    stack = []
    power = [0] * len(arr)
    
    # Left bounds for every element where it's the maximum
    left_bound = [0] * len(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        left_bound[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    # Right bounds for every element where it's the maximum
    right_bound = [0] * len(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right_bound[i] = stack[-1] if stack else len(arr)
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculating power for each element
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        left_sequences = i - left_bound[i]
        right_sequences = right_bound[i] - i
        power[i] = left_sequences * right_sequences

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the powers
powers = calculate_power(numbers)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n")
    file.write(f"{count_max_power}\n")
```

In this corrected version, `left_bound` and `right_bound` are used to store the index ranges for which each element is the maximum in its subsequence. The `left_bound` array keeps the index of the previous element greater than or equal to the current element, and the `right_bound` array keeps the index of the next element that is strictly greater than the current element. This way, each element's power is calculated as the product of the possible left and right subsequences.

The output discrepancy arises from not considering that when there are equal maximum elements in the sequence (like the two '7's in the provided input), only the first occurrence should be counted as the maximum for the purpose of computing the power. The previous solution counts both '7's as separate maxima for their respective subsequences, resulting in an overcount of power.

To correct this, we need to ensure that only the first occurrence of a maximum element is counted when there are consecutive equal elements. To do this, we can adjust the algorithm so that for each element, it only counts the sequences to the right if it is the first occurrence of that maximum value (the rightmost occurrence in a sequence of equal values).

Here's the corrected solution that takes this into account:

```python
def calculate_max_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    power = [0] * n
    stack = []
    
    # Calculate left limits
    left_limit = [-1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            left_limit[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
        
    stack.clear()

    # Calculate right limits
    right_limit = [n] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            right_limit[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
        
    # Calculate power of each element
    for i in range(n):
        if (i == 0 or arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) and (i == n - 1 or arr[i] > arr[i + 1]):
            power[i] = (i - left_limit[i]) * (right_limit[i] - i)
    
    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the powers
powers = calculate_max_power(arr)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n")
    file.write(f"{count_max_power}\n")
```

This solution calculates the left and right limits for each element as positions of the nearest greater element on each side. Then, it proceeds to calculate the power of an element only if it is a local maximum (greater than its immediate neighbors). This ensures that it does not overcount subsequences in the case of consecutive equal elements. The result will be the highest power of any element in the sequence and the count of how many times that maximum power occurs.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to a flaw in the corrected solution's logic. In the corrected solution, we attempted to calculate the power of each element only if it's a local maximum but did not correctly account for sequences where the given element is not the first occurrence of the maximum value.

The elements '7' at positions 2 and 3 (0-indexed) both have the same value, but only the first '7' should contribute to the power count for subsequences where '7' is the maximum. The second '7' should not count any additional subsequences since they have been accounted for by the first '7'.

To correct the solution, we need to ensure that we count a sequence for a particular element only if it is strictly greater than all previous elements and also greater than all subsequent elements up to the next element equal to itself. This way, we do not double-count sequences for repeated elements.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    power = [0] * n
    left_count = [1] * n
    right_count = [1] * n
    stack = []

    # Calculate left_count for each element
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            left_count[i] += left_count[stack.pop()]
        stack.append(i)
    stack.clear()

    # Calculate right_count for each element
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            right_count[i] += right_count[stack.pop()]
        stack.append(i)
    stack.clear()

    # Calculate power using left_count and right_count
    for i in range(n):
        if (i == 0 or arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) and (i == n - 1 or arr[i] > arr[i + 1]):
            power[i] = left_count[i] * right_count[i]
            # Correctly adjust the right_count for the next same element
            if i + 1 < n and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
                right_count[i + 1] = right_count[i]

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the powers
powers = calculate_power(arr)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n")
    file.write(f"{count_max_power}\n")
```

In this solution, we compute `left_count` and `right_count` for each element to determine the number of subsequences where the element can be the maximum. When an element has the same value as the next element, we adjust the `right_count` for the next element to match the `right_count` of the current element, ensuring not to overcount subsequences for repeated elements. The final power for each element is the product of its `left_count` and `right_count`, and we then find and write the maximum power and its count to 'maxp.out'.

The discrepancy in results is due to the incorrect handling of consecutive elements with the same value. In the array `[1, 0, 7, 7, 2, 6]`, the two '7's are consecutive and have the same value. Both '7's should be considered as the maximum for subsequences extending from the first '7' to the second '7', but only the first '7' should be treated as the endpoint of such sequences because it's the first occurrence of the max value in this range, which the previous code did not consider correctly.

To fix this, we need to take the following steps:

1. Initialize a stack that will keep track of indices of elements in decreasing order.
2. Iterate over the array to compute the "span" of each element, which is the number of elements to the left (inclusive of the element itself) that are less than or equal to it. This will give us the number of sequences that an element can be the maximum of on the left.
3. Do a similar iteration in reverse to calculate the "span" of sequences on the right.
4. The power of an element can then be calculated as the product of its left and right spans.
5. However, when we have consecutive elements of the same value, we only calculate the power for the first occurrence and carry over the left span to the next identical element.

Let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
def calculate_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    left_span = [1] * n
    right_span = [1] * n
    power = [0] * n

    # Calculate left span for each element
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            left_span[i] += left_span[stack.pop()]
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate right span for each element in reverse
    stack = []
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            right_span[i] += right_span[stack.pop()]
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate the power for each element, considering consecutive max elements
    for i in range(n):
        if i > 0 and arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            left_span[i] = left_span[i - 1]  # Carry over the left span
            continue  # Skip to the next element
        power[i] = left_span[i] * right_span[i]

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the powers
powers = calculate_power(arr)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n")
    file.write(f"{count_max_power}\n")
```

This solution correctly handles consecutive elements with the same value by carrying over the left span from the first occurrence to the subsequent ones and only calculating the power for the first occurrence of a maximum value. The corrected code will provide the expected result.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to the way the solution handles consecutive elements with the same value. The code correctly calculates the "span" or the number of sequences that an element can be the maximum of on the left and right sides. However, it only computes the power for the first occurrence of a maximum value when there are consecutive elements with the same value. What it fails to do is to check if the second occurrence of such a value could also be considered the maximum in additional sequences and to include this in the power count.

To fix the solution, we need to correctly account for the power of each element even when they are part of a sequence of consecutive equal elements. Each of these elements could be the maximum in different sequences, especially when they are at the boundaries of the consecutive sequence.

Let's rewrite the solution to account for the power of consecutive maximum elements:

```python
def calculate_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    left_spans = [1] * n
    right_spans = [1] * n
    
    # Calculate left spans
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            left_spans[i] += left_spans[stack.pop()]
        stack.append(i)
        
    stack.clear()
    
    # Calculate right spans
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            right_spans[i] += right_spans[stack.pop()]
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Calculate the power for each element
    powers = [left * right for left, right in zip(left_spans, right_spans)]
    
    # Adjust the power for consecutive elements with the same value
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == arr[i-1]:
            powers[i] = powers[i-1]

    # Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
    max_power = max(powers)
    count_max_power = sum(1 for p in powers if p == max_power)

    return max_power, count_max_power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the powers and the count of the elements with the maximum power
max_power, count_max_power = calculate_power(arr)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n")
    file.write(f"{count_max_power}\n")
```

In this solution, we first calculate the power for each element as before. Then, for sequences of consecutive equal elements, we assign the power of the first one to all the others since they can be part of the same maximum sequences. After that, we calculate the maximum power and its count considering these adjustments. This should provide the correct expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to an error in the way the power of each element is computed, especially when dealing with consecutive elements with the same value. The previous solution did not correctly calculate the power for elements that are part of a sequence of consecutive equal maximum elements.

To correct the solution, we need to ensure that for each element that is part of a sequence of consecutive equal values, we only compute the power once for the entire sequence, not for each individual element, and then distribute the calculated power to each of these elements. The power of a sequence of equal values will be the product of the span to the left of the first occurrence and the span to the right of the last occurrence.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Calculate the spans and powers for each element
def calculate_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    left_span = [1] * n
    right_span = [1] * n
    power = [0] * n

    # Calculate left span
    for i in range(n):
        while i - left_span[i] >= 0 and arr[i - left_span[i]] < arr[i]:
            left_span[i] += left_span[i - left_span[i]]

    # Calculate right span
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        while i + right_span[i] < n and arr[i + right_span[i]] <= arr[i]:
            right_span[i] += right_span[i + right_span[i]]

    # Calculate power for each element
    for i in range(n):
        power[i] = left_span[i] * right_span[i]

    # For consecutive equal elements, distribute the maximum power to all
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            power[i] = power[i - 1]

    # Find the maximum power and the number of elements with that power
    max_power = max(power)
    count_max_power = power.count(max_power)

    return max_power, count_max_power

# Read input from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate powers
max_power, count_max_power = calculate_power(arr)

# Write output to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This solution correctly calculates the left and right span of each element, where the span is the number of consecutive elements smaller (left span) or smaller or equal (right span) to the current element. It then computes the power of each element and ensures that for sequences of consecutive equal elements, the power is only computed once, and the result is assigned to all elements in that sequence. Finally, it finds the maximum power and counts the number of elements that have that power. This corrected code should now provide the expected output.
