Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

The original solution I submitted does not correctly handle the case where there are equal elements in the sequence that can be the maximum of a subsequence. It also did not consider the fact that the power of each element should only be counted when the element itself is strictly greater than the other elements in all of the subsequences it is part of. The original implementation did not properly account for these cases.

We can correct the solution by keeping track of the last time we've seen an element greater than or equal to the current one. This will help us correctly calculate the number of subsequences where the current element is the maximum.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline())
    nums = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables to track the maximum power and its frequency
max_power = 0
max_power_count = 0

# Initialize a list to track the current power of each element
powers = [0] * n

# Initialize a stack to keep track of elements and their left limits
stack = []

# Go through each element to calculate its power
for i in range(n):
    # Pop elements from the stack if they are smaller than the current element
    while stack and nums[stack[-1][0]] < nums[i]:
        stack.pop()
    
    # Calculate the left limit for the current element
    left_limit = stack[-1][1] + 1 if stack else 0

    # Push the current element and its left limit onto the stack
    stack.append((i, left_limit))

    # Calculate the power for the current element based on its left limit
    powers[i] = i - left_limit + 1

# Clear the stack to reuse it for calculating right limits
stack.clear()

# Go through each element in reverse to update its power
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # Pop elements from the stack if they are smaller than or equal to the current element
    while stack and nums[stack[-1][0]] <= nums[i]:
        stack.pop()

    # Calculate the right limit for the current element
    right_limit = stack[-1][1] - 1 if stack else n - 1

    # Update the power for the current element based on its right limit
    powers[i] *= right_limit - i + 1

    # Update maximum power and its count
    if powers[i] > max_power:
        max_power = powers[i]
        max_power_count = 1
    elif powers[i] == max_power:
        max_power_count += 1

    # Push the current element and its right limit onto the stack
    stack.append((i, right_limit))

# Write the results to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_power}\n{max_power_count}\n')
```

In this corrected solution, we correctly calculate the power for each element by determining its left and right limits, which are the boundaries within which the element is the maximum in its subsequences. We also correctly update the maximum power and count the occurrences of the maximum power. This should now give the correct expected results.

Upon reviewing the discrepancies between the expected and found results, it is clear that the provided solution still does not correctly handle cases with equal elements. When there are two or more consecutive maximum elements, each should be considered as the maximum of the subsequences ending with that element.

Let's address the implementation issue and rewrite the solution. We'll need to keep track of the counts of subsequences that each element terminates on both the left and right sides. This information will allow us to calculate the power of each element correctly.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def calculate_subsequence_counts(sequence):
    stack = []
    left_counts = [0] * len(sequence)
    right_counts = [0] * len(sequence)

    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        # Count how many subsequences are terminated by sequence[i] on the left
        count = 1
        while stack and sequence[stack[-1]] <= sequence[i]:
            count += left_counts[stack[-1]]
            stack.pop()
        left_counts[i] = count
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    for i in range(len(sequence) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Count how many subsequences are terminated by sequence[i] on the right
        count = 1
        while stack and sequence[stack[-1]] < sequence[i]:
            count += right_counts[stack[-1]]
            stack.pop()
        right_counts[i] = count
        stack.append(i)

    return left_counts, right_counts

# Read data from the input file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    nums = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate subsequence counts for each position
left_counts, right_counts = calculate_subsequence_counts(nums)

# Calculate the power of each element and find the maximum power and its frequency
max_power = 0
max_power_count = 0

for i in range(n):
    power = left_counts[i] * right_counts[i]
    if nums[i] > 0: # Consider only positive elements
        if power > max_power:
            max_power = power
            max_power_count = 1
        elif power == max_power:
            max_power_count += 1

# Write the results to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{max_power_count}\n")
```

The function `calculate_subsequence_counts` calculates the counts of subsequences terminated by each element of the sequence on both the left and right sides. The main part of the code then iterates through each element, calculating its power as the product of its left and right counts. It also keeps track of the maximum power and the number of elements that have that maximum power.

This revised solution should now correctly handle cases with equal elements and provide the expected output for the input data.

It appears there was a mistake in previously proposed solutions. Let's carefully analyze the problem and implement a solution that considers the constraints on subsequences correctly.

Given a sequence of numbers, we need to calculate the number of subsequences where each number is the maximum and strictly greater than other numbers in the subsequence. To do this, we need to count for each number the subsequences to the left and to the right where it is the greatest number.

We only need to consider continuous subsequences starting from the number in question extending to the left and right for as long as the sequence is increasing. When we encounter a number that is equal or larger, we stop, as the subsequence would no longer meet the criteria.

The power of each number can be calculated as the product of the count of increasing subsequences to the left (including the number itself) and to the right (excluding the number itself). The maximum power can be found by comparing the powers of all numbers, and then we can count how many numbers have this maximum power.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    nums = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

left_limits = [0] * n
right_limits = [0] * n

# Calculate left limits for each number
count = 1
for i in range(n):
    left_limits[i] = count
    if i + 1 < n and nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 1

# Calculate right limits for each number
count = 1
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    right_limits[i] = count
    if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 1
right_limits[n - 1] = 1

# Calculate the power of each number and find the maximum power
max_power = 0
for i in range(n):
    power = left_limits[i] * right_limits[i]
    if power > max_power:
        max_power = power

# Count how many numbers have the maximum power
max_power_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if left_limits[i] * right_limits[i] == max_power)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{max_power_count}\n")
```

This solution calculates the left and right limits correctly, considering the constraints, and should provide the expected output for the given input data.

Let's attempt to solve the problem again by correctly calculating the number of subsequences where an element is the maximum. As previously mentioned, the power of an element is the product of the number of increasing subsequences to the left and right of the element where it is the greatest. For an element `a[i]`, subsequences to the left end at `a[i]`, and subsequences to the right start after `a[i]`.

To calculate the power of each element correctly, we need to count how many times it is possible to select a subsequence ending with `a[i]` from the left and starting after `a[i]` from the right, where `a[i]` is the maximum element in both subsequences.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    nums = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize variables to keep track of the power of elements
powers = [0] * n
left_count = [0] * n
right_count = [0] * n

# Calculate the number of left and right subsequences for each element
stack = []
for i in range(n):
    while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
        stack.pop()
    left_count[i] = i + 1 if not stack else i - stack[-1]
    stack.append(i)

stack.clear()
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    while stack and nums[stack[-1]] <= nums[i]:
        stack.pop()
    right_count[i] = n - i if not stack else stack[-1] - i
    stack.append(i)

# Compute the power for each element and find the maximum power
max_power = 0
for i in range(n):
    powers[i] = left_count[i] * right_count[i]
    if powers[i] > max_power:
        max_power = powers[i]

# Count the number of elements that have the maximum power
max_power_elements = powers.count(max_power)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_power}\n{max_power_elements}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly handle all cases, including consecutive elements with the same value, and give the expected output for the input data.

In the previous attempts, the solutions were incorrect because they did not properly account for the requirement that the element `a_i` must be strictly greater than the other elements in all of the subsequences used to compute its power. Additionally, when there are consecutive elements with the same value, each should be counted separately in terms of their subsequences.

Now let's fix the solution by ensuring that we only count subsequences where `a_i` is the strictly greatest element. We can do this by maintaining a monotonically decreasing stack. When processing an element, we will compute the number of subsequences where it is the maximum by considering the distance to the previous larger element and the distance to the next larger element.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
# Open the input file and read the number of elements and the sequence
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    a = list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split()))

powers = [1] * n  # The power of each element is at least 1 (the element itself)
stack = []  # This stack will keep pairs (index, count) for the elements

# Process the elements from left to right
for i in range(n):
    count = 1  # Initialize count for the current element
    while stack and stack[-1][0] <= a[i]:
        count += stack[-1][1]  # Accumulate the count of previous elements that are not greater
        stack.pop()  # Remove the elements that are not greater

    stack.append((a[i], count))  # Push the current element and its count to the stack
    powers[i] *= count  # Multiply the power of the current element by its count so far

stack.clear()  # Clear the stack for the next iteration

# Process the elements from right to left
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    count = 1  # Initialize count for the current element
    while stack and stack[-1][0] < a[i]:
        count += stack[-1][1]  # Accumulate the count of previous elements that are not greater
        stack.pop()  # Remove the elements that are not greater

    stack.append((a[i], count))  # Push the current element and its count to the stack
    powers[i] *= count  # Multiply the power of the current element by its count so far

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This implementation should correctly handle subsequences and find the maximum power and the number of elements with that maximum power, thus providing the correct expected output for the input data.

The previous solutions failed because they didn't correctly compute the number of subsequences where the element is strictly greater than others. When computing the power of an element, we need to consider the number of subsequences where the element is the unique maximum by multiplying the number of increasing subsequences ending with that element on the left and the number of increasing subsequences starting right after that element on the right.

We will now apply a correct algorithm to find the required power for each element by using a monotonically decreasing stack to keep track of the previous greater elements, which will help us find the number of valid subsequences ending with the current element. Then, we will do a similar process in reverse to find the number of valid subsequences starting after the current element. While doing this, we need to handle equal elements correctly by only counting them for the first occurrence and not for subsequent equal elements.

Here is the revised and corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from the input file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline())
    a = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize arrays to store the number of subsequences ending and starting with each element
left_subseq = [0] * n
right_subseq = [0] * n
stack = []

# Calculate the number of subsequences ending with each element
for i in range(n):
    count = 1
    # While the current element is greater than the element at the top of the stack
    while stack and a[stack[-1]] <= a[i]:
        # Pop elements and count the number of valid subsequences
        count += left_subseq[stack.pop()]
    left_subseq[i] = count
    stack.append(i)

stack.clear()

# Calculate the number of subsequences starting after each element
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    count = 1
    # While the current element is greater than the element at the top of the stack
    while stack and a[stack[-1]] < a[i]:
        # Pop elements and count the number of valid subsequences
        count += right_subseq[stack.pop()]
    right_subseq[i] = count
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the power of each element and find the maximum power
max_power = 0
for i in range(n):
    power = left_subseq[i] * right_subseq[i]
    if a[i] > max_power:
        max_power = power

# Count the number of elements with the maximum power
max_power_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if left_subseq[i] * right_subseq[i] == max_power)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{max_power_count}\n")
```

The key difference in this solution is that we properly count the number of increasing subsequences ending with `a[i]` on the left and starting right after `a[i]` on the right. We also handle consecutive equal elements correctly by only counting the first occurrence of an equal element when counting subsequences ending with `a[i]`, and not counting them when counting subsequences starting after `a[i]`. This corrected approach should now match the expected output.
