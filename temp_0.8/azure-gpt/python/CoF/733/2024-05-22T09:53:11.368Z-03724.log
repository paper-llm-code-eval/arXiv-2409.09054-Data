Graniţa nu se trece uşor. Asta pentru că Balaurul Arhirel (mare pasionat de informatică) nu lasă pe nimeni să treacă decât după ce răspunde la nişte întrebări...

În acea ţară există $3$ tipuri de perle normale (le vom nota cu $1$, $2$ şi $3$) şi $3$ tipuri de perle magice (le vom nota cu $A$, $B$ şi $C$). Perlele magice sunt deosebite prin faptul că se pot transforma în alte perle (una sau mai multe, normale sau magice):
- Perla magică de tipul $A$ se poate transforma în orice perlă normală (una singură);
- Perla magică de tipul $B$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $B$, sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una magică de tipul $A$, una normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $A$ şi una magică de tipul $C$;
- Perla magică de tipul $C$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $B$ şi una magică de tipul $C$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $A$.

Ca să rezumăm cele de mai sus putem scrie:
```
A -> 1  | 2     | 3
B -> 2B | 1A3AC
C -> 2  | 3BC   | 12A
```

Balaurul Arhirel ne lasă la început să ne alegem o perlă magică (una singură), iar apoi folosind numai transformările de mai sus trebuie să obţinem un anumit şir de perle normale. Când o perlă magică se transformă, perlele din stânga şi din dreapta ei rămân la fel (şi în aceeaşi ordine). De asemenea ordinea perlelor rezultate din transformare este chiar cea prezentată mai sus.

De exemplu, dacă balaurul ne cere să facem şirul de perle `21132123`, putem alege o perlă magică de tipul $B$ şi următorul şir de transformări: `B -> 2B -> 21A3AC -> 21A3A12A -> 21132123`.

Întrucât Balaurul nu are prea multă răbdare, el nu ne cere decât să spunem dacă se poate sau nu obţine şirul respectiv de perle.

# Cerință

Să se determine pentru fiecare şir de intrare dacă se poate obţine prin transformările de mai sus sau nu (alegând orice primă perlă magică, la fiecare şir).

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `perle.in` are următoarea structură:
* Pe prima linie numărul $N$, reprezentând numărul de şiruri din fişierul de intrare;
* Urmează $N$ linii; a $i$-a linie dintre cele $N$ descrie şirul $i$, printr-o succesiune de numere naturale despărţite de câte un spaţiu. Primul număr reprezintă lungimea şirului $L_i$, iar următoarele $L_i$ numere sunt tipurile de perle normale, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `perle.out` va conţine $N$ linii. Pe linia $i$ se va scrie un singur număr $1$ sau $0$ ($1$ dacă se poate obţine şirul respectiv (al $i$-lea) şi $0$ dacă nu se poate).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq L_i \leq 10 \ 000$, pentru oricare $i$;

Upon review, it appears there was an error in the logic of the initial solution. Specifically, the check for whether a sequence can be obtained is too simplistic and does not consider the recursive nature of the pearl transformations. The problem requires us to consider that a magical pearl can continue to transform into more pearls including other magical pearls which in turn can transform again.

Therefore, we need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that can recursively or iteratively simulate the transformation process to determine if a given sequence of normal pearls can be achieved.

Below is the corrected solution which handles the recursive transformation of magical pearls to check if a given sequence can be obtained:

```python
def transform_able(seq):
    # Base cases
    if len(seq) == 0:
        return True
    if len(seq) == 1:
        return seq[0] == 2

    # Recursive cases
    if seq[0] == 1:
        return transform_able(seq[1:])  # Skip A transformation
    
    if seq[0] == 2:
        if seq[1] == 3:
            return transform_able(['A'] + seq[2:])  # B -> 1A3AC -> A + rest of sequence
        else:
            return transform_able(seq[1:])  # B -> 2B transformation

    if seq[0] == 3:
        if len(seq) >= 3 and seq[1] == 1 and seq[2] == 2:
            return transform_able(['A'] + seq[3:])  # C -> 12A transformation
        else:
            return transform_able(['B', 'C'] + seq[1:])  # C -> 3BC transformation

# Read from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline())
    sequences = []
    for _ in range(n):
        sequence_data = list(map(int, file_in.readline().split()))
        length = sequence_data[0]
        sequence = sequence_data[1:length + 1]
        sequences.append(sequence)

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        result = 1 if transform_able(seq) else 0
        file_out.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This corrected solution attempts to match the start of the sequence with the possible transformations of magical pearls. If the transformation is possible, the function calls itself with the remaining sequence, simulating the transformation of a magical pearl into normal pearls and possibly additional magical pearls, until either the sequence is matched or no more transformations are possible. If the sequence is matched, the function returns `True`, indicating the original sequence can be obtained. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The previous solution did not correctly represent the transformation rules for the magical pearls. The magical pearls can transform into a combination of normal and magical pearls, and we must account for all possible transformations to check if a sequence can be obtained. We must handle each type of transformation carefully and backtrack if necessary to find a valid series of transformations.

Let's reconsider the problem and implement a correct algorithm that can handle the combinations of transformations:

1. Magical pearl A can transform into any normal pearl.
2. Magical pearl B can transform into a sequence starting with a normal pearl 2 followed by a magical pearl B, or into a sequence starting with 1, magical pearl A, normal pearl 3, magical pearl A, and magical pearl C.
3. Magical pearl C can transform into a normal pearl 2, or into a sequence starting with a normal pearl 3, followed by magical pearls B and C, or into a sequence starting with normal pearls 1 and 2 and followed by a magical pearl A.

Considering these rules, we can recursively check if we can obtain a sequence starting with any of the magical pearls. We need to simulate the transformation process by replacing the magical pearls with the respective sequences they can transform into and check if the original sequence can be formed.

Here's a revised solution that implements the correct logic:

```python
def simulate_transformations(seq, trans_seq):
    if not seq:
        return not trans_seq
    if not trans_seq:
        return False

    first_trans = trans_seq[0]
    if first_trans in 'ABC':
        if first_trans == 'A':
            # Try transforming A into 1, 2, or 3 and see if it leads to a solution
            for replacement in range(1, 4):
                if simulate_transformations(seq, [replacement] + trans_seq[1:]):
                    return True
        elif first_trans == 'B':
            # Try transforming B into 2B and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, [2] + ['B'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
            # Try transforming B into 1A3AC and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, [1] + ['A'] + [3] + ['A'] + ['C'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
        elif first_trans == 'C':
            # Try transforming C into 2 and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, [2] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
            # Try transforming C into 3BC and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, [3] + ['B'] + ['C'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
            # Try transforming C into 12A and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, [1] + [2] + ['A'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
    else:
        if seq[0] == first_trans:
            return simulate_transformations(seq[1:], trans_seq[1:])
        else:
            return False
    return False

# Read from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    sequences = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(n)]

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        # Try starting with each magical pearl and see if it leads to a solution
        result = any(simulate_transformations(seq, [magical_pearl]) for magical_pearl in 'ABC')
        file_out.write(f'{int(result)}\n')
```

This solution approaches the problem by attempting to simulate all possible transformations starting with a single magical pearl (A, B, or C) and recursively checking if the sequence can be obtained. If any starting magical pearl leads to the original sequence, the function returns `True`, and we write `1` to the output file. If none of the starting magical pearls work, the function returns `False`, and we write `0` to the output file.

The issue with the program is that it is expecting strings for comparison in the `in` operation, but it receives an `int` type for `first_trans` when it's trying to check if `first_trans` is one of the magical pearls ('A', 'B', 'C'). This is due to the recursive call with `[replacement]` which is an `int`.

To fix the issue, we have to ensure that when we are comparing `first_trans` with strings 'A', 'B', 'C', `first_trans` must also be a string. We also have to convert the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to strings when we replace a magical pearl with a normal pearl.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def simulate_transformations(seq, trans_seq):
    if not seq:
        return not trans_seq
    if not trans_seq:
        return False

    first_trans = trans_seq[0]
    if first_trans in 'ABC':
        if first_trans == 'A':
            # Try transforming A into '1', '2', or '3' and see if it leads to a solution
            for replacement in ['1', '2', '3']:
                if simulate_transformations(seq, [replacement] + trans_seq[1:]):
                    return True
        elif first_trans == 'B':
            # Try transforming B into '2B' and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, ['2', 'B'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
            # Try transforming B into '1A3AC' and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, ['1', 'A', '3', 'A', 'C'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
        elif first_trans == 'C':
            # Try transforming C into '2' and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, ['2'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
            # Try transforming C into '3BC' and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, ['3', 'B', 'C'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
            # Try transforming C into '12A' and see if it leads to a solution
            if simulate_transformations(seq, ['1', '2', 'A'] + trans_seq[1:]):
                return True
    else:
        if seq[0] == int(first_trans): # Convert string to int for comparison
            return simulate_transformations(seq[1:], trans_seq[1:])
        else:
            return False
    return False

# Read from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    sequences = [[int(num) for num in file_in.readline().strip().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        # Try starting with each magical pearl and see if it leads to a solution
        result = any(simulate_transformations(seq, [magical_pearl]) for magical_pearl in ['A', 'B', 'C'])
        file_out.write(f'{int(result)}\n')
```

This revised solution ensures that we are always working with strings for the magical pearls and integers for the normal pearls. When we do comparisons or transformations, we make sure to convert between types as necessary. The `simulate_transformations` function will now correctly handle the transformations according to the rules.

The initial approach was incorrect because it did not accurately represent the transformation rules for the magical pearls, and the recursive solution was too complex and error-prone. We need a more straightforward algorithm to verify whether a sequence can be obtained using the magical pearl transformations.

The key to solving this problem is to realize that each magical pearl transformation either leaves the same number of magical pearls (transformation B into 2B) or reduces the number of magical pearls by one (transformation A into a normal pearl, transformation B into 1A3AC, transformation C into 2, 3BC, or 1 2A). Given this, we can reduce the problem to a counting one where we verify the number of occurrences of each normal pearl and infer whether they can be generated by a sequence of transformations starting with a magical pearl.

Let's fix the algorithm with this understanding.

```python
def check_sequence(seq):
    # Count the number of normal pearls
    count_1 = seq.count(1)
    count_2 = seq.count(2)
    count_3 = seq.count(3)
    
    # Check the number of 2s and 3s to infer the presence of B and C pearls
    # Since B can create an endless amount of 2s but only one B can be initially chosen,
    # there must be at least as many 1s and 3s as there are excess 2s.
    excess_2 = count_2 - count_1 - count_3
    
    # If there are more 2s than 1s and 3s combined, it's not possible
    # (because we can't generate extra 2s without using up an A or a C pearl)
    if excess_2 > 0:
        return False
    
    # If there are not enough 3s to account for every C transformation, it's not possible
    # (because a C transformation always results in at least one 3)
    if count_3 < -excess_2:
        return False
    
    # Otherwise, it's possible to generate the sequence with a valid series of transformations
    return True

# Read from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    sequences = [[int(num) for num in file_in.readline().strip().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        # Check if the sequence can be obtained
        result = check_sequence(seq)
        file_out.write(f'{int(result)}\n')
```

This revised solution uses a counting approach to determine if the sequence of normal pearls can be generated by a series of transformations starting with a single magical pearl. It checks the number of each type of normal pearl and applies the rules of transformation to infer whether the sequence is possible. If the conditions are met, the sequence can be obtained. If not, it cannot be obtained, and we write `0` to the output file. If the conditions are met, we write `1` to the output file.

The difference between the expected and found result is due to an incorrect check for the third test case. The test case with input `1 3` expects an output of `1`, indicating that the sequence can be achieved. However, the algorithm incorrectly outputs `0`. This discrepancy suggests that the current checks are incomplete or incorrect.

Upon revisiting the problem, we need to consider that a magical pearl:

- Type A can transform into any single normal pearl (1, 2, or 3).
- Type B can transform into a sequence of pearls including at least one normal pearl 2 and can reproduce itself (potentially leading to more 2s).
- Type C can transform into a sequence of pearls that does not include a normal pearl 2 without reproducing itself (resulting in a net decrease of magical pearls).

Considering these rules, we can make the following conclusions:

- If there is an equal or greater number of 1s and 3s combined compared to the number of 2s, we can always start with a type B magical pearl, as it can reproduce more 2s while transforming the overabundance of 1s and 3s using A and C pearls.
- If there are more 2s than the combination of 1s and 3s, it's not possible to achieve the sequence because we would run out of magical pearls to convert into 2s.

Let's implement a revised solution with this logic.

```python
def is_sequence_possible(sequence):
    count_1 = sequence.count(1)
    count_2 = sequence.count(2)
    count_3 = sequence.count(3)
    # There must be at least as many 1s and 3s together as there are 2s to be able to generate the sequence.
    return count_2 <= count_1 + count_3

# Read from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline())
    sequences = []
    for _ in range(n):
        _, *sequence = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
        sequences.append(sequence)

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        file_out.write(f'{int(is_sequence_possible(seq))}\n')
```

This solution should now produce the correct output, as it considers the correct counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s needed to determine if a sequence can be obtained from transformations of magical pearls. It should output `1` for the sequence `1 3` because we can start with a type A magical pearl that transforms into a normal pearl 3.
