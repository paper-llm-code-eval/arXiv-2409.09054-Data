Graniţa nu se trece uşor. Asta pentru că Balaurul Arhirel (mare pasionat de informatică) nu lasă pe nimeni să treacă decât după ce răspunde la nişte întrebări...

În acea ţară există $3$ tipuri de perle normale (le vom nota cu $1$, $2$ şi $3$) şi $3$ tipuri de perle magice (le vom nota cu $A$, $B$ şi $C$). Perlele magice sunt deosebite prin faptul că se pot transforma în alte perle (una sau mai multe, normale sau magice):
- Perla magică de tipul $A$ se poate transforma în orice perlă normală (una singură);
- Perla magică de tipul $B$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $B$, sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una magică de tipul $A$, una normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $A$ şi una magică de tipul $C$;
- Perla magică de tipul $C$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $B$ şi una magică de tipul $C$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $A$.

Ca să rezumăm cele de mai sus putem scrie:
```
A -> 1  | 2     | 3
B -> 2B | 1A3AC
C -> 2  | 3BC   | 12A
```

Balaurul Arhirel ne lasă la început să ne alegem o perlă magică (una singură), iar apoi folosind numai transformările de mai sus trebuie să obţinem un anumit şir de perle normale. Când o perlă magică se transformă, perlele din stânga şi din dreapta ei rămân la fel (şi în aceeaşi ordine). De asemenea ordinea perlelor rezultate din transformare este chiar cea prezentată mai sus.

De exemplu, dacă balaurul ne cere să facem şirul de perle `21132123`, putem alege o perlă magică de tipul $B$ şi următorul şir de transformări: `B -> 2B -> 21A3AC -> 21A3A12A -> 21132123`.

Întrucât Balaurul nu are prea multă răbdare, el nu ne cere decât să spunem dacă se poate sau nu obţine şirul respectiv de perle.

# Cerință

Să se determine pentru fiecare şir de intrare dacă se poate obţine prin transformările de mai sus sau nu (alegând orice primă perlă magică, la fiecare şir).

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `perle.in` are următoarea structură:
* Pe prima linie numărul $N$, reprezentând numărul de şiruri din fişierul de intrare;
* Urmează $N$ linii; a $i$-a linie dintre cele $N$ descrie şirul $i$, printr-o succesiune de numere naturale despărţite de câte un spaţiu. Primul număr reprezintă lungimea şirului $L_i$, iar următoarele $L_i$ numere sunt tipurile de perle normale, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `perle.out` va conţine $N$ linii. Pe linia $i$ se va scrie un singur număr $1$ sau $0$ ($1$ dacă se poate obţine şirul respectiv (al $i$-lea) şi $0$ dacă nu se poate).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq L_i \leq 10 \ 000$, pentru oricare $i$;

It appears that the initial approach was incorrect, and the logic used to determine whether a sequence can be constructed was flawed. To address this, we need to adjust the strategy.

Given the transformation rules for magical pearls:

```
A -> 1  | 2     | 3
B -> 2B | 1A3AC
C -> 2  | 3BC   | 12A
```

We can deduce the following:
- Pearl B can generate a sequence starting and ending with 2.
- Pearl C can generate a sequence starting with 2 and ending with 3.
- Pearl A can generate sequences of length 1.

So, we can generate any sequence that starts with 2 and can use a combination of B and C (with the necessary A's in between if needed) to generate sequences of 1s and 3s flanked by 2s.

Here are the steps needed to correctly implement the solution:

1. Count the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s in each sequence.
2. Consider the possible sequences that can be generated from each magical pearl (A, B, and C).
3. Check if the given sequence fits any of the generatable sequence patterns from the magical pearls.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
# Code to solve the pearl transformation problem

def check_transform_possible(pearl_sequence):
    count_1 = pearl_sequence.count(1)
    count_2 = pearl_sequence.count(2)
    count_3 = pearl_sequence.count(3)
    
    # Check if the sequence can be generated from A.
    if len(pearl_sequence) == 1 and (count_1 == 1 or count_2 == 1 or count_3 == 1):
        return True

    # Check if the sequence can be generated from B or C.
    # It should start with 2, end with 2 or 3, and should not have 1s and 3s at the same time without a 2 in between.
    if count_2 == 0 or count_1 + count_3 > count_2:
        return False

    prev_pearl = 2
    for pearl in pearl_sequence:
        if (prev_pearl == 1 or prev_pearl == 3) and pearl == prev_pearl:
            return False
        prev_pearl = pearl
    
    # The sequence is valid if it starts with 2 and doesn't have consecutive 1s or 3s without a 2 in between.
    return True

# Read from file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline())
    sequences = [[int(x) for x in line.split()[1:]] for line in file_in]

# Write to file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        file_out.write(f'{int(check_transform_possible(seq))}\n')
```

This code will read the input from `perle.in`, check for each sequence if it can be transformed from a magical pearl by applying the correct logical checks, and then write the output to `perle.out`. The implemented logic now takes into account the correct conditions under which a sequence can be created from the magical pearls.

The previous solutions failed to correctly determine whether the sequences can be generated from any magical pearl. A correct algorithm should account for specific sequences that can be generated by each type of magical pearl. 

Here are the transformation rules with additional insight:

- A magical pearl of type A can be replaced with any single normal pearl (1, 2, or 3).
- A magical pearl of type B can generate an arbitrary number of 2's since `B -> 2B`. It can also be expanded to a sequence `1A3AC` which has the notable property of containing one more 1 than 3's. This is because the A's here can become either 1's or 3's, but we will always be left with one extra 1.
- A magical pearl of type C can generate a sequence ending with one more 3 than 2's because `C -> 3BC` allows us to have additional 3's over 2's. Given that `C -> 2` and `C -> 12A` are also possible, C can create any sequence of a single 2 or sequences starting with 1 and ending with 2, but with an excess of 3's over 2's.

To check whether a given sequence can be generated, we need to verify if the counts and order of 1's, 2's, and 3's match any combination of these rules. The key insights are that a sequence can only be generated if it starts with a 2 (from B or C) or a 1 (from A or C), and the number of 2's cannot be less than the number of 1's and 3's combined unless the sequence starts with a 1, in which case it can be generated by a single A.

Let's implement a correct algorithm based on these rules:

```python
def can_transform(seq):
    count_1 = seq.count(1)
    count_2 = seq.count(2)
    count_3 = seq.count(3)
    
    if count_1 == count_3 and count_2 >= count_1:
        return True  # B can generate equal numbers of 1s and 3s with enough 2s
    if count_1 - 1 == count_3 and count_2 >= count_3:
        return True  # B's sequence 1A3AC can generate one more 1 than 3s if 2s are sufficient
    if count_3 - 1 == count_1 and count_2 <= count_3:
        return True  # C can generate one more 3 than 1s if 2s are fewer or equal to 3s
    if count_1 == 0 and count_3 == 0:
        return True  # Only 2s can be generated by C
    if count_1 == 1 and count_2 == 0 and count_3 == 0:
        return True  # Single 1 can be generated by A
    if count_3 == 1 and count_2 == 0 and count_1 == 0:
        return True  # Single 3 can be generated by A
    
    return False  # No other combination is possible

# Read from file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline())
    sequences = [[int(x) for x in line.split()[1:]] for line in file_in]

# Write to file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        file_out.write(f'{int(can_transform(seq))}\n')
```

This updated solution incorporates the understanding of what each magical pearl can generate and checks the given sequences against these possibilities. This should now correctly determine for each sequence if it can be obtained through the transformations defined by the magical pearls A, B, and C.

The results differ because the previous solution did not correctly determine all the possible sequences that can be generated by the magical pearls. Specifically, the rule for pearl B was incorrectly implemented. B can generate an arbitrary number of 2s, but once a sequence deviates from just 2s by using `B -> 1A3AC`, the number of 3s cannot surpass the number of 1s in the rest of the sequence because A can only transform into a single pearl.

To fix the solution, we need to implement a new strategy that respects the transformation abilities of each magical pearl:

- Pearl A can turn into a single pearl of any type.
- Pearl B can create a sequence of 2s indefinitely (`B -> 2B`), and it can also create a sequence that starts with a 1 followed by some 2s and ends with a 3, but with one more 1 than 3s due to the fixed transformation `B -> 1A3AC`.
- Pearl C can create a sequence that starts with either a 2 or a 1 followed by a 2, and ends with a 3, with one more 3 than 1s due to the fixed transformation `C -> 3BC`.

Therefore, for a sequence to be possible, it must conform to one of these patterns, given that we can choose which magical pearl to start with:

1. If there is an equal number of 1s and 3s, the sequence can be made starting with B, generating 2s as needed.
2. If there is one more 1 than 3s, the sequence can be made starting with B, as it can generate an extra 1 via `B -> 1A3AC`.
3. If there is one more 3 than 1s, the sequence can be made starting with C, as it can generate an extra 3 via `C -> 3BC`.
4. If the sequence consists only of 2s, it can be made starting with B, generating 2s indefinitely.
5. If the sequence has only one 1 or one 3, it can be made starting with A, transforming into the respective single pearl.
6. Other sequences are impossible because they require more 1s or 3s than can be provided by the fixed transformation rules.

Let's implement the correct solution based on this analysis:

```python
def can_transform(sequence):
    count_1 = sequence.count(1)
    count_2 = sequence.count(2)
    count_3 = sequence.count(3)
    
    # Cases where the sequence is possible
    if count_1 == count_3 and count_2 >= count_1:  # B can generate equal 1s and 3s with sufficient 2s
        return True
    if count_1 == count_3 + 1:  # B can generate one more 1 than 3s
        return True
    if count_3 == count_1 + 1 and count_2 <= count_3:  # C can generate one more 3 than 1s
        return True
    if count_1 == 0 and count_3 == 0:  # Only 2s, possible with B
        return True
    if count_1 == 1 and count_2 == 0 and count_3 == 0:  # Single 1, possible with A
        return True
    if count_3 == 1 and count_2 == 0 and count_1 == 0:  # Single 3, possible with A
        return True
    
    # If none of the conditions are met, it's impossible
    return False

# Read from file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline())
    sequences = [[int(x) for x in line.split()[1:]] for line in file_in]

# Process each sequence and write to file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for sequence in sequences:
        result = can_transform(sequence)
        file_out.write(f'{int(result)}\n')
```

This corrected solution processes each sequence according to the rules for transforming magical pearls into normal pearls, writes 1 if a sequence is possible, and 0 if not. It should now produce the expected output for the given input data.

The previous solutions didn't correctly handle the constraints imposed by the transformation rules. The key to solving this challenge lies in identifying a pattern that can be generated by each type of magical pearl and ensuring that the given sequence fits that pattern.

Magical pearl A can transform into any single normal pearl, so it can generate any sequence of length 1.

Magical pearl B can generate sequences with an arbitrary number of 2s, but once it transforms into `1A3AC`, it can generate a sequence with one more 1 than 3. Note that we cannot get rid of this extra 1, so for a sequence to be valid, there must be at least as many 1s as 3s, and if there are more 1s than 3s, the difference must be exactly 1.

Magical pearl C can generate sequences that either have an equal number of 2s and 3s or one additional 3 over the number of 2s. An equal number can be obtained directly through `C -> 2`, and one additional 3 can be obtained through `C -> 3BC`.

To check if the sequence is valid, we need to ensure that:
- The number of 1s is greater than or equal to the number of 3s.
- The number of 2s is at least equal to the number of 3s or the number of 1s, whichever is greater.
- If the number of 1s is greater than the number of 3s, the difference must be exactly 1 (to account for the B transform `1A3AC`).

Let's rewrite the solution with these constraints in mind:

```python
# Function to determine if a sequence can be formed by magical pearls
def can_form_sequence(sequence):
    count_1 = sequence.count(1)
    count_2 = sequence.count(2)
    count_3 = sequence.count(3)

    # Check for the pattern created by B: Equal number of 1s and 3s or one extra 1
    if count_1 >= count_3 and (count_2 >= count_1 or count_2 >= count_3):
        if count_1 == count_3 or count_1 == count_3 + 1:
            return True

    # Check for the pattern created by C: Equal number of 2s and 3s or one extra 3
    if count_3 >= count_1 and count_2 >= count_1:
        if count_3 == count_1 or count_3 == count_2:
            return True

    # Check if sequence can be created by A (only one pearl in sequence)
    if len(sequence) == 1:
        return True

    return False

# Read from file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    sequences = [[int(x) for x in file_in.readline().strip().split()[1:]] for _ in range(N)]

# Write to file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        result = can_form_sequence(seq)
        file_out.write(f'{int(result)}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly determine whether each sequence can be obtained through magical pearl transformations and write the appropriate results to `perle.out`.

To address the problem, we need to focus on the patterns that can result from using each magical pearl:

1. **Pearl A**: Can turn into any one of the normal pearls (1, 2, or 3).
2. **Pearl B**: Can generate sequences with an arbitrary number of 2s, and it can also transform into `1A3AC`. This means that B can generate a sequence that, at any point, has at least as many 1s as 3s, with a potential excess of a single 1.
3. **Pearl C**: Can generate sequences ending with a 2, or with `3BC` can generate a sequence that has an equal number of 2s and 3s or one more 3 than 2s.

However, the solution also needs to consider the ordering rules. When a pearl transforms, the pearls on the left and right remain unchanged (and in the same order). This means we can't just count the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s; their order is also relevant. 

For example, the sequence `2 2 2` cannot be created because there is no way to create three consecutive 2s without turning the magical pearl into another magical pearl (`B -> 2B`), which would introduce either a 1 or a 3 into the sequence.

Here is a solution that takes order into account:

```python
# Function to check if the sequence can be formed
def can_form_sequence(sequence):
    # The sequence can start with any normal pearl if it's a single pearl.
    if len(sequence) == 1:
        return True

    # If the sequence starts with 1, it must be transformable by an A at the beginning.
    if sequence[0] == 1:
        # After the initial A->1, the rest must follow a B-like pattern.
        sequence = sequence[1:]

    count_1 = sequence.count(1)
    count_2 = sequence.count(2)
    count_3 = sequence.count(3)

    # Check if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 form a pattern that can be created by B or C.
    # For pearl B, there must be at least as many 1s as 3s, and enough 2s for the rest.
    # For pearl C, there must be at least as many 3s as 1s, and at least as many 2s as 3s.
    return count_1 >= count_3 and count_2 >= count_1 or \
           count_3 >= count_1 and count_2 >= count_3

# Read from the input file, process each sequence, and write the result to the output file.
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in, open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    N = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(N):
        sequence = list(map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split()[1:]))
        file_out.write(f'{int(can_form_sequence(sequence))}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly identify sequences that can be created using magical pearls according to the task's rules and constraints. It should yield the expected output for the provided input data.

The previous solutions failed to properly account for the transformation rules and the specific sequence order. The key mistake was in the logic used to determine the possibility of generating the input sequences. We need a new approach that correctly applies the transformation rules and checks the sequence order.

We can observe the following about the transformation rules:

- A magical pearl of type A can become any single normal pearl.
- A magical pearl of type B can generate a sequence of `2`s indefinitely but can also generate a sequence with one `1` at the beginning, followed by one `3`, and another one at the end (`1A3AC`). This means that B can generate a sequence where the number of `2`s is greater than or equal to the sum of `1`s and `3`s minus one (since it can generate an extra `1`).
- A magical pearl of type C can generate a sequence where the number of `2`s is equal to the sum of `1`s and `3`s, or the number of `3`s is one more than the number of `2`s (`3BC`), or the number of `2`s is one more than the sum of `1`s and `3`s (`12A`).

Given these transformation rules, we can conclude:

- If the sequence starts with a `1`, we can use an A-type pearl.
- If the sequence starts with a `2`, we can either use B or C-type pearls to construct the sequence. We must ensure that the number of `2`s can cover the number of `1`s and `3`s, with the possibility of having one less `2` if the sequence starts with a `1`.
- The sequence `2 2 2` is impossible because there's no transformation that can generate three `2`s consecutively without an extra `1` or `3` being introduced.

Let's rewrite the solution using this information:

```python
def can_generate_sequence(sequence):
    # Count the number of each type of pearl
    count_1 = sequence.count(1)
    count_2 = sequence.count(2)
    count_3 = sequence.count(3)
    
    # Check if the sequence is just a single pearl
    if len(sequence) == 1:
        return True  # Any single pearl can be generated by A
    
    # Check if the sequence can be generated by magical pearl B or C
    # B can generate sequences with equal or more 1's than 3's
    # C can generate sequences with equal or more 3's than 1's
    if count_1 >= count_3 and count_2 >= count_1 - 1:
        return True
    if count_3 >= count_1 and count_2 >= count_3:
        return True
    
    return False

# Read from file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    sequences = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().strip().split()[1:])) for _ in range(N)]

# Check each sequence and write to file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for sequence in sequences:
        file_out.write(f'{int(can_generate_sequence(sequence))}\n')
```

This solution should correctly evaluate the given sequences according to the magical pearl transformation rules and produce the expected output for the input data.
