Un parc de formă dreptunghiulară este format din zone pietonale şi piste de biciclete. Reprezentând harta parcului într-un sistem cartezian, cu coordonata colţului stânga-jos `(0,0)`, pistele de biciclete sunt reprezentate prin dungi orizontale sau verticale colorate cu gri, iar zonele pietonale au culoarea albă, ca în figura din dreapta.

Vizitatorii parcului se pot plimba liber pe zonele pietonale în orice direcţie, însă pistele de biciclete se vor traversa, în linie dreaptă,  paralel cu axele. În figura alăturată avem un parc de dimensiuni `10 x 8`, cu piste de biciclete verticale între `2` şi `4` respectiv `5` şi `8`, şi  orizontale între `0` şi `1` respectiv între `2` şi `4`. Gigel se află în punctul `A(1 , 1)` şi poate sa ajungă pe drumul cel mai scurt la prietenul lui, în punctul `B(8 , 7)` deplasându-se astfel: porneşte din punctul `(1, 1)` şi parcurge un traseu format din segmente cu extremităţile în punctele de coordonate `(1.5 , 2) (1.5, 4) (2 , 5) (4 , 5) (5 , 7)` şi în final ajunge în punctul de coordonate `(8 , 7)`. 

Lungimea totală a drumului va fi aproximativ `11.4721359`.

# Cerinţă
Cunoscând dimensiunile parcului, coordonatele lui Gigel, coordonatele prietenului lui şi poziţiile pistelor de biciclete, să se calculeze lungimea drumului minim şi numărul drumurilor distincte de lungime minimă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `parc.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale `Xparc` şi `Yparc` separate prin spaţiu, reprezentând dimensiunile parcului în direcţiile `Ox` respectiv `Oy`.

Linia a treia va conţine un număr natural `m`, reprezentând numărul pistelor verticale. Următoarele `m` linii vor conţine perechi de valori de pe axa `Ox` ce delimitează câte o pistă de biciclete verticală. Următoarea linie va conţine un număr natural `n`, reprezentând numărul pistelor orizontale. Următoarele `n` linii vor conţine perechi de valori de pe axa `Oy` ce delimitează câte o pistă de biciclete orizontală.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python

# Function to write results to parc.out
def write_result(min_length, path_count):
    with open('parc.out', 'w') as f:

# Parse input from parc.in

# Function to calculate the number of distinct paths
@cache
def count_paths(x, y, px, py):
    # Base case: reached the end point
    if x == px and y == py:
        return 1

    paths = 0
    # Move right
    if x < px:
        nx = min(v[0] for v in vertical if v[0] > x) - 1
        paths += count_paths(nx, y, px, py)

    # Move left
    if x > px:
        nx = max(v[1] for v in vertical if v[1] < x) + 1
        paths += count_paths(nx, y, px, py)

    # Move up
    if y < py:
        ny = min(h[0] for h in horizontal if h[0] > y) - 1
        paths += count_paths(x, ny, px, py)

    # Move down
    if y > py:
        ny = max(h[1] for h in horizontal if h[1] < y) + 1
        paths += count_paths(x, ny, px, py)

    return paths

# Calculate the number of distinct minimal paths
num_min_paths = count_paths(xG, yG, xpr, ypr)

# Write results to parc.out
write_result(min_path_length, num_min_paths)
```

This solution takes into account the restrictions and requirements mentioned in the challenge. It calculates the minimal path length using Manhattan distance, since the paths are parallel to the axes, and uses memoization with `functools.cache` to count the number of distinct minimal paths. It then writes the results to `parc.out` as specified.

The differences in the results indicate that the previous implementation has two main issues:

1. The calculated minimal path length is incorrect because it uses a simple Manhattan distance calculation. However, the problem requires considering the constraints imposed by bike lanes, which the Manhattan distance does not account for. The actual minimal path length requires a more complex calculation involving the positions of bike lanes.

2. The calculated number of distinct minimal paths is zero, which is incorrect according to the expected output. This is likely because the implementation does not correctly count valid paths given the constraints of the bike lanes.

To address these issues, we need to implement an algorithm that correctly calculates the shortest path distance considering the bike lanes and counts the number of distinct minimal paths.

Let's reimplement the solution taking into account bike lanes. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path and count the number of distinct paths of minimal length.

```python
from collections import deque
from math import sqrt

# Read input data from parc.in
with open('parc.in') as f:
    Xparc, Yparc = map(int, f.readline().split())
    xG, yG, xpr, ypr = map(int, f.readline().split())
    m = int(f.readline().strip())
    vertical = [tuple(sorted(map(int, f.readline().split()))) for _ in range(m)]
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    horizontal = [tuple(sorted(map(int, f.readline().split()))) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the minimal path length considering bike lanes
def calc_min_path_length():
    path_length = sqrt((xG - xpr) ** 2 + (yG - ypr) ** 2)
    return path_length

# Calculate the number of distinct minimal paths
def calc_num_min_paths():
    visited = set()
    q = deque([(xG, yG, 0)])  # (x, y, path_length)
    min_path_count = 0
    shortest_path_length = float('inf')

    while q:
        x, y, path_length = q.popleft()
        # Check if we reached the destination
        if (x, y) == (xpr, ypr):
            if path_length < shortest_path_length:
                shortest_path_length = path_length
                min_path_count = 1
            elif path_length == shortest_path_length:
                min_path_count += 1
            continue

        # Add neighbors to the queue
        for dx in [-1, 1]:  # left, right
            nx = x + dx
            if 0 <= nx <= Xparc and not (x, min(y, y+1)) in vertical and (nx, y) not in visited:
                q.append((nx, y, path_length + 1))
                visited.add((nx, y))

        for dy in [-1, 1]:  # down, up
            ny = y + dy
            if 0 <= ny <= Yparc and not (min(x, x+1), y) in horizontal and (x, ny) not in visited:
                q.append((x, ny, path_length + 1))
                visited.add((x, ny))
    
    return min_path_count

# Calculate minimal path length
min_length = calc_min_path_length()

# Calculate the number of distinct minimal paths
path_count = calc_num_min_paths()

# Write results to parc.out
with open('parc.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(f"{min_length:.9f}\n{path_count}\n")
```

This revised solution first calculates the minimal path length using Euclidean distance, since we need to traverse diagonally across the bike lanes. Next, it uses BFS to explore all possible paths while keeping track of the shortest path found and the number of such paths. We make sure to not visit the same point twice to prevent infinite loops and only move to points that are not blocked by bike lanes. Finally, the results are written to `parc.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to an incorrect calculation of the minimal path length. The provided solution calculates the Euclidean distance directly between the points, which is not correct because the problem specifies that the paths must be parallel to the axes and navigate around bike lanes. 

Considering the constraints of the problem, the minimal path length will be greater than or equal to the Manhattan distance, but it may be longer due to the need to avoid bike lanes. We need to calculate the shortest path around the bike lanes.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to implement a pathfinding algorithm that takes the bike lanes into account. We will use an A* search algorithm with a Manhattan distance heuristic, which is more appropriate for a grid-based pathfinding problem with axis-aligned movements.

Let's reimplement the solution using the A* algorithm for the correct minimal path length and BFS to count the number of paths of that length:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from collections import deque

# Function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points
def manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)

# Function to check if a move is valid (not crossing a bike lane)
def is_valid_move(x1, y1, x2, y2, vertical, horizontal):
    if x1 == x2:  # Vertical move
        for lane_start, lane_end in vertical:
            if min(x1, x2) < lane_start and max(x1, x2) > lane_end and lane_start <= y1 < lane_end:
                return False
    else:  # Horizontal move
        for lane_start, lane_end in horizontal:
            if min(y1, y2) < lane_start and max(y1, y2) > lane_end and lane_start <= x1 < lane_end:
                return False
    return True

# A* search algorithm to find the shortest path length
def a_star_search(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, vertical, horizontal):
    open_set = []
    heappush(open_set, (0 + manhattan_distance(xG, yG, xpr, ypr), (xG, yG), 0))
    came_from = {}
    g_score = { (xG, yG): 0 }
    
    while open_set:
        _, current, current_g_score = heappop(open_set)
        if current == (xpr, ypr):
            return current_g_score  # Shortest path length found
        
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:  # Possible moves
            neighbor = (current[0] + dx, current[1] + dy)
            if not is_valid_move(current[0], current[1], neighbor[0], neighbor[1], vertical, horizontal):
                continue  # Not a valid move (crossing a bike lane)
            tentative_g_score = current_g_score + 1
            if neighbor not in g_score or tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
                # This path to neighbor is better than any previous one. Record it!
                came_from[neighbor] = current
                g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
                f_score = tentative_g_score + manhattan_distance(neighbor[0], neighbor[1], xpr, ypr)
                heappush(open_set, (f_score, neighbor, tentative_g_score))
    
    return None  # Path not found

# BFS to count the number of shortest paths
def bfs_shortest_paths(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, shortest_path_length, vertical, horizontal):
    queue = deque([(xG, yG, 0)])
    count = 0
    visited = set([(xG, yG)])
    
    while queue:
        x, y, path_length = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == (xpr, ypr):
            if path_length == shortest_path_length:
                count += 1  # Found a shortest path
            continue
        
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:  # Possible moves
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if (nx, ny) not in visited and is_valid_move(x, y, nx, ny, vertical, horizontal):
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny, path_length + 1))
    
    return count

# Implementing the solution
shortest_path_length = a_star_search(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, vertical, horizontal)
num_shortest_paths = bfs_shortest_paths(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, shortest_path_length, vertical, horizontal)

# Write results to parc.out
with open('parc.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(f"{shortest_path_length:.9f}\n{num_shortest_paths}\n")
```

This solution first uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path length while avoiding bike lanes. It utilizes the Manhattan distance as a heuristic for the A* search. After finding the shortest path length, it uses BFS to count all the paths that have this length, again considering the constraints of the bike lanes. Finally, the results are written to `parc.out`.

The `NameError` indicates that the variable `xG` is not defined in the scope where the `a_star_search` function is called. This happened because the code block was meant to be a continuous script, but it was split incorrectly, leading to variables not being defined in the latter part of the script.

Let's fix this by ensuring all the necessary variables are defined before they are used, and provide a complete implementation in a single code block.

This implementation defines all necessary functions and then uses a `main` function to orchestrate reading the input, executing the pathfinding algorithm, and writing the output. The `a_star` function is fixed to check for blocked paths correctly, and `is_blocked` is used to check if a move is valid considering the bike lanes. The `write_output` function writes the minimal path length and number of distinct minimal paths to `parc.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests that the A* search algorithm did not find a valid path, and therefore returned `inf` for distance and `0` for path count. This can happen if the pathfinding algorithm incorrectly treats all moves as blocked or if there's a logic error determining valid moves.

The `is_blocked` function, as implemented, directly uses the x-coordinate to check for vertical bike lanes and the y-coordinate for horizontal bike lanes. This logic is incorrect; we should check if the path between two points crosses a bike lane.

Here's a corrected implementation that uses a BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path and counts the number of shortest paths. This problem doesn't require an A* search algorithm as the paths are simple and only involve orthogonal moves:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read input data from parc.in
with open('parc.in') as f:
    Xparc, Yparc = map(int, f.readline().split())
    xG, yG, xpr, ypr = map(int, f.readline().split())
    m = int(f.readline().strip())
    vertical = [tuple(sorted(map(int, f.readline().split()))) for _ in range(m)]
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    horizontal = [tuple(sorted(map(int, f.readline().split()))) for _ in range(n)]

# Function to check if a move is blocked by a bike path
def is_move_blocked(bike_paths, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    if x1 == x2:  # vertical move
        for path in bike_paths:
            if path[0] <= y1 < path[1] or path[0] < y2 <= path[1]:
                if x1 == path[0] or x1 == path[1]:
                    return True
    else:  # horizontal move
        for path in bike_paths:
            if path[0] <= x1 < path[1] or path[0] < x2 <= path[1]:
                if y1 == path[0] or y1 == path[1]:
                    return True
    return False

# BFS to find the shortest path length and count the number of shortest paths
def bfs_shortest_path(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, vertical, horizontal):
    queue = deque([(xG, yG)])
    visited = {(xG, yG): (0, 1)} # (distance, path_count)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] # up, right, down, left
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        current_distance, current_count = visited[(x, y)]
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx <= Xparc and 0 <= ny <= Yparc:
                if not is_move_blocked(vertical if dy == 0 else horizontal, x, y, nx, ny):
                    if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                        visited[(nx, ny)] = (current_distance + 1, current_count)
                        queue.append((nx, ny))
                    else:
                        distance, count = visited[(nx, ny)]
                        if distance == current_distance + 1:
                            visited[(nx, ny)] = (distance, count + current_count)
    
    return visited.get((xpr, ypr), (0, 0))

# Calculate the shortest path length and the number of shortest paths
shortest_path_length, num_shortest_paths = bfs_shortest_path(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, vertical, horizontal)

# Calculate the true minimal path length as the Euclidean distance of the orthogonal path
min_length = shortest_path_length * sqrt(2)

# Write results to parc.out
with open('parc.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(f"{min_length:.9f}\n{num_shortest_paths}\n")
```

This implementation corrects the `is_move_blocked` function to properly check if a move from one coordinate to another is valid considering the bike lanes. We use BFS to find the shortest path and count the number of shortest paths. Since the shortest path in BFS is composed of orthogonal moves, the true minimal path length is the orthogonal distance times `sqrt(2)` to account for the diagonal moves at the bike lanes, as required by the problem description. Finally, the results are written to `parc.out`.

The error is caused by the `sqrt` function from the `math` module not being imported into the current namespace. Hence, when the code tries to use `sqrt(2)`, it fails with a `NameError` because Python doesn't recognize `sqrt` as a defined name.

Let's fix the code by importing the `sqrt` function at the start of the script and then run the corrected solution. Here's the complete, fixed implementation:

```python
from collections import deque
from math import sqrt

# Read input data from parc.in
with open('parc.in') as f:
    Xparc, Yparc = map(int, f.readline().split())
    xG, yG, xpr, ypr = map(int, f.readline().split())
    m = int(f.readline().strip())
    vertical = [tuple(sorted(map(int, f.readline().split()))) for _ in range(m)]
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    horizontal = [tuple(sorted(map(int, f.readline().split()))) for _ in range(n)]

# Function to check if a move is blocked by a bike path
def is_move_blocked(bike_paths, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    if x1 == x2:  # vertical move
        for path in bike_paths:
            if path[0] <= y1 < path[1] or path[0] < y2 <= path[1]:
                if x1 == path[0] or x1 == path[1]:
                    return True
    else:  # horizontal move
        for path in bike_paths:
            if path[0] <= x1 < path[1] or path[0] < x2 <= path[1]:
                if y1 == path[0] or y1 == path[1]:
                    return True
    return False

# BFS to find the shortest path length and count the number of shortest paths
def bfs_shortest_path(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, vertical, horizontal):
    queue = deque([(xG, yG)])
    visited = {(xG, yG): (0, 1)} # (distance, path_count)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] # up, right, down, left
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        current_distance, current_count = visited[(x, y)]
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx <= Xparc and 0 <= ny <= Yparc:
                if not is_move_blocked(vertical if dy == 0 else horizontal, x, y, nx, ny):
                    if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                        visited[(nx, ny)] = (current_distance + 1, current_count)
                        queue.append((nx, ny))
                    else:
                        distance, count = visited[(nx, ny)]
                        if distance == current_distance + 1:
                            visited[(nx, ny)] = (distance, count + current_count)
    
    return visited.get((xpr, ypr), (0, 0))

# Calculate the shortest path length and the number of shortest paths
shortest_path_length, num_shortest_paths = bfs_shortest_path(xG, yG, xpr, ypr, vertical, horizontal)

# Calculate the true minimal path length as the Euclidean distance of the orthogonal path
min_length = shortest_path_length * sqrt(2)

# Write results to parc.out
with open('parc.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(f"{min_length:.9f}\n{num_shortest_paths}\n")
```

This code now includes the `sqrt` function from the `math` module, and it should correctly calculate the minimal path and the number of distinct minimal paths. It then writes these values to the file `parc.out`.
