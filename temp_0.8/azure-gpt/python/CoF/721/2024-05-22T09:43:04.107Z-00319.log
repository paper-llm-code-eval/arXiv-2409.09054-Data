Se consideră un automat de criptare format dintr-un tablou cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane, tablou ce conţine toate numerele de la $1$ la $n^2$ aşezate ”şerpuit” pe linii, de la prima la ultima linie, pe liniile impare pornind de la stânga către dreapta, iar pe cele pare de la dreapta către stânga (ca în figura alăturată).

~[cff5d8861bae938b2eed0dd1708a990c.png]

Numim ”amestecare“ operaţia de desfăşurare în spirală a valorilor din tablou în ordinea indicată de săgeţi şi de reaşezare a acestora în acelaşi tablou, ”şerpuit” pe linii ca şi în cazul precedent.

De exemplu, desfăşurarea tabloului conduce la şirul: $1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 12 \ 13 \ 14 \ 15 \ 16 \ 9 \ 8 \ 7 \ 6 \ 11 \ 10$, iar reaşezarea acestuia în tablou conduce la obţinerea unui nou tablou reprezentat în cea de-a doua figură alăturată.

~[dfa4ef22ee11881dd041cd3cb27af121.png]

După orice operaţie de amestecare se poate relua procedeul, efectuând o nouă amestecare. S-a observat un fapt interesant: că după un număr de amestecări, unele valori ajung din nou în poziţia iniţială (pe care o aveau în tabloul de pornire). De exemplu, după două amestecări, tabloul de $4 \cdot 4$ conţine $9$ dintre elementele sale în exact aceeaşi poziţie în care se aflau iniţial (vezi elemente marcate din figură).

# Cerinţă

Pentru $n$ şi $k$ citite, scrieţi un program care să determine numărul minim de amestecări ale unui tablou de n linii necesar pentru a ajunge la un tablou cu exact $k$ elemente aflate din nou în poziţia iniţială.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `spirala.in` conţine pe prima linie cele două numere $n$ şi $k$ despărţite printr-un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `spirala.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul de amestecări determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq N \leq 50$
* Datele de intrare sunt alese astfel încât numărul minim de amestecări necesare să nu depăşească $2 \cdot 10^9$

The previous implementation has performance issues due to the full simulation of the shuffling process. This approach may not be efficient enough to handle larger values of `n` within a reasonable time frame. 

To address the issue and improve performance, we can take advantage of the cyclical nature of the problem. Instead of fully simulating each shuffle, we can calculate the cycles of each element's position in the matrix and determine the number of shuffles required for `k` elements to return to their original positions.

Here's the updated algorithm:

1. Compute the position of each element after one shuffle without fully simulating the shuffle.
2. Identify the cycle length for each element, which is the number of shuffles required for an element to return to its original position.
3. Use the cycle lengths to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the necessary cycles to get `k` elements back in their original positions.

Let's implement this new solution:

```python
from math import gcd

# Function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM)
def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

# Function to find the cycle length for a given position
def find_cycle_length(pos, size):
    cycle = 1
    initial_pos = pos
    while True:
        pos = next_position(pos, size)
        if pos == initial_pos:
            break
        cycle += 1
    return cycle

# Function to calculate the next position after one shuffle
def next_position(pos, size):
    row, col = divmod(pos, size)
    
    # Determine the direction of movement based on the row
    if row % 2 == 0:  # Moving right
        if col == size - 1:  # Last column, move down
            pos += size
        else:  # Move right
            pos += 1
    else:  # Moving left
        if col == 0:  # First column, move down
            pos -= (size - 1)
        else:  # Move left
            pos -= 1
    
    # Adjust for the spiral movement
    if pos >= size * size:
        pos -= size * size
    
    return pos

# Read from 'spirala.in'.
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
cycle_lengths = []

# Calculate cycle lengths for all positions
for i in range(n * n):
    cycle_lengths.append(find_cycle_length(i, n))

# Sort the cycle lengths and reverse to start with the largest cycles
cycle_lengths.sort(reverse=True)

# Find the LCM of the first k cycle lengths
shuffles_required = 1
for i in range(k):
    shuffles_required = lcm(shuffles_required, cycle_lengths[i])

# Write to 'spirala.out'.
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{shuffles_required}\n')
```

In this solution, we calculate the cycle length for each element in the matrix, which tells us how many shuffles it takes for that element to return to its original position. We then find the least common multiple of these cycle lengths, specifically for the first `k` elements with the longest cycles, which will give us the minimum number of shuffles needed for exactly `k` elements to be in their original positions.

Run this script with the `spirala.in` file containing:
```
6 36
```
And the `spirala.out` file should now contain the expected output:
```
330
```

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system due to it running out of memory, or it was killed by a system signal such as SIGKILL, which is often due to the process exceeding a memory or a time limit.

The issue in the previous solution lies in trying to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) for potentially a large number of cycle lengths, which can lead to extremely large numbers and overflow issues. Additionally, the algorithm may still be inefficient since it attempts to find cycle lengths for all elements, which is unnecessary.

A better approach would be to:

1. Determine the cycle length for each position in the matrix without explicitly simulating the shuffles.
2. Keep track of the number of positions with each cycle length.
3. Find the minimum number of shuffles required to get `k` elements back to their original positions by iterating through cycle lengths in decreasing order and using only as many as needed to reach `k` elements.

Here's the updated solution:

```python
from math import gcd
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM)
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function to find the cycle length for a given position
def find_cycle_length(pos, n):
    seen = set()
    steps = 0
    while pos not in seen:
        seen.add(pos)
        pos = next_pos(pos, n)
        steps += 1
    return steps

# Function to simulate the next position after one shuffle
def next_pos(pos, n):
    row, col = divmod(pos-1, n)
    if row % 2 == 0:  # even row, move right
        col = (col + 1) % n
        if col == 0:  # wrapped around to the next row
            row += 1
    else:  # odd row, move left
        col = (col - 1 + n) % n
        if col == n - 1:  # wrapped around to the next row
            row += 1
    new_pos = row * n + col + 1
    return new_pos

# Read from 'spirala.in'.
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate cycle lengths for all positions and count them
cycle_counts = defaultdict(int)
for pos in range(1, n*n + 1):
    cycle_length = find_cycle_length(pos, n)
    cycle_counts[cycle_length] += 1

# Sort cycle lengths in descending order and find the minimum number of shuffles
sorted_cycle_lengths = sorted(cycle_counts.keys(), reverse=True)

# Initialize variables for cycle length and number of elements to consider
result_lcm = 1
elements_to_consider = k
for cycle_length in sorted_cycle_lengths:
    count = cycle_counts[cycle_length]
    # Take as many elements with this cycle length as needed to reach k
    if elements_to_consider <= count:
        # This is the last cycle length we need to consider
        result_lcm = lcm(result_lcm, cycle_length)
        break
    else:
        # We take all the elements with this cycle length and reduce the remaining number
        result_lcm = lcm(result_lcm, cycle_length)
        elements_to_consider -= count

# Write to 'spirala.out'.
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{result_lcm}\n')
```

This solution should not cause a memory overflow since we don't track individual element positions, nor does it calculate the LCM of a large set of numbers. Instead, it uses a more efficient approach by considering cycle lengths and their counts, ensuring that the result stays within reasonable bounds. Run this script with the `spirala.in` file containing `6 36`, and it should produce the expected output.

The exit code 137 indicating that the program was killed, most likely due to excessive memory usage or running too long, suggests that even with the cycle counting approach, the program still might be inefficient or have a memory issue. One possible reason could be the calculation of LCM using large numbers, which might be causing the program to run out of memory or exceed time limits.

To fix the program, we need to optimize the cycle length detection and LCM calculation further. We'll calculate the cycle lengths for each position only once and store them, avoiding repeated calculation. Then, we'll determine the number of shuffles in a more efficient manner.

Here is an optimized solution that should bypass the memory and time constraints:

```python
from math import gcd
from collections import Counter

# Function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) for two numbers
def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

# Function to calculate the next position of an element in the matrix after one shuffle
def next_position(pos, size):
    row, col = divmod(pos - 1, size)
    if row % 2 == 0: # even row (0-indexed), move right
        col = (col + 1) % size
    else: # odd row, move left
        col = (col - 1 + size) % size
    # Moving down to the next row if we're at the beginning or end of one
    if col == 0 or col == size - 1:
        row += 1
    return row * size + col

# Function to find the number of shuffles for each element to return to its original position
def find_cycles(size):
    cycles = {}
    for i in range(size * size):
        pos = i
        count = 0
        while (pos not in cycles):
            cycles[pos] = -1
            pos = next_position(pos, size)
            count += 1
        if cycles[pos] == -1: # First time this cycle is completed
            cycle_length = count
            while cycles[pos] == -1:
                cycles[pos] = cycle_length
                pos = next_position(pos, size)
    return cycles

# Read from 'spirala.in'.
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Get the cycles for each position in the matrix
cycles = find_cycles(n)

# Count the frequencies of each cycle length
cycle_counts = Counter(cycles.values())

# Start with a shuffle count of 1 (identity) and find the LCM of the most common cycle lengths
shuffle_count = 1
for cycle_length, frequency in cycle_counts.most_common():
    if k <= 0:
        break
    if frequency >= k:
        shuffle_count = lcm(shuffle_count, cycle_length)
        break
    else:
        shuffle_count = lcm(shuffle_count, cycle_length)
        k -= frequency

# Write to 'spirala.out'.
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(shuffle_count) + "\n")
```

This solution should now efficiently calculate the cycle lengths and the number of shuffles needed to get `k` elements back to their original positions without causing any memory issues. It avoids recalculating the next position for elements that are already part of a known cycle, thus significantly reducing the number of operations required. The LCM is calculated only for the necessary cycle lengths, which helps to keep the numbers manageable.

Please run this script with the given input file `spirala.in`. It should work without causing an exit code 137 error and produce the expected output.

Given that the program is exiting with code 137 and there is no output to stdout or stderr, the most common cause would be that the program is terminated by the system for exceeding resource limits, most likely memory or time limits. This could be due to the inefficiency of the algorithm, particularly if there is a lot of unnecessary computation or large data structures in use.

To fix the program, we need to analyze the cycle detection algorithm. The previous solution attempted to calculate the cycle length for each element individually, which is unnecessary. Instead, we only need to track the cycle lengths of individual elements and find the number of cycles that include exactly `k` elements.

Here's a revised approach that should be more efficient:

1. Realize that in the shuffle, only the border elements change their positions, while the inner matrix (of size `(n-2)x(n-2)`) behaves like a smaller instance of the problem.
2. Only calculate the cycle lengths for the border elements, which are the ones that change positions in each shuffle.
3. Use a more efficient method to calculate LCMs on the fly for the border elements.

Here's the optimized solution:

```python
from math import gcd

# Function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) for two numbers
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function to calculate the cycle length for each border element
# For an nxn matrix, there are 4n - 4 border elements
def border_cycles(n):
    cycle_lengths = []
    
    # Top and bottom rows (excluding corners) have n-2 elements that cycle with a length of 4n-4
    cycle_lengths.extend([4*n - 4] * (n - 2))
    cycle_lengths.extend([4*n - 4] * (n - 2))
    
    # Left and right columns (excluding corners) have n-2 elements that cycle with a length of 2n
    cycle_lengths.extend([2*n] * (n - 2))
    cycle_lengths.extend([2*n] * (n - 2))
    
    # Four corners each cycle with a length of 2n
    cycle_lengths.extend([2*n] * 4)
    
    return cycle_lengths

# Function to find the minimum number of shuffles required for k elements
# to return to their original position
def min_shuffles(n, k):
    if k == n * n:
        return 0  # No shuffles needed if all elements must return
    
    total_elements = n * n
    current_lcm = 1
    for border_size in range(n, 1, -2):  # Reduce the border size by 2 each time
        # Calculate the cycles for the current border
        cycles = border_cycles(border_size)
        
        # Find the LCM of the cycle lengths for the current border
        for cycle in cycles:
            if total_elements - cycle >= k:
                current_lcm = lcm(current_lcm, cycle)
                total_elements -= cycle
            else:
                return current_lcm  # Found the minimum shuffles required
        # Subtract the number of border elements from the total_elements
        total_elements -= (border_size * 4 - 4)
        
    return current_lcm

# Read from 'spirala.in'.
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of shuffles required
shuffles_required = min_shuffles(n, k)

# Write to 'spirala.out'.
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{shuffles_required}\n')
```

This updated solution should be more efficient and address the resource constraint issues that led to the program's previous termination with exit code 137. By focusing only on the border elements, which actually participate in the cycles, and by calculating the LCM progressively and intelligently based on the problem's structure, we significantly reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of shuffles required for `k` elements to return to their original positions. Specifically, the border cycles logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the actual movement of elements on the border of the matrix during the shuffling process.

To fix the issue, we need to accurately determine the cycle lengths for the elements on the border of the matrix and calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths up to the point where we have included `k` elements.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct approach:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function to simulate the next position of an element after one shuffle
def next_position(row, col, size):
    if row == 0:
        if col < size - 1: return (row, col + 1)
        else: return (row + 1, col)
    elif row == size - 1:
        if col > 0: return (row, col - 1)
        else: return (row - 1, col)
    elif col == size - 1:
        if row < size - 1: return (row + 1, col)
        else: return (row, col - 1)
    elif col == 0:
        if row > 0: return (row - 1, col)
        else: return (row, col + 1)

# Function to find the cycle length for a position
def find_cycle_length(row, col, size):
    start_pos = (row, col)
    count = 0
    while True:
        row, col = next_position(row, col, size)
        count += 1
        if (row, col) == start_pos:

This revised solution calculates the cycle length for each element on the border of the matrix, counts the frequency of each cycle length, and then calculates the LCM of the cycle lengths considering up to `k` elements. It should now provide the correct minimum number of shuffles required for `k` elements to return to their original positions.

Please run this script with the input file `spirala.in` containing `4 9`. It should now produce the expected output of `2`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that there is a logical issue in the way the cycles are computed and combined to determine the minimum number of shuffles required for `k` elements to return to their original position.

The fundamental problem in the previous solution is that it assumes that combining cycle lengths using LCM will directly give us the minimum number of shuffles required for `k` elements to be back in their original positions. However, this is not necessarily the case, as some elements might return to their original positions after different numbers of shuffles, and we have to consider subsets of cycle lengths that bring exactly `k` elements back.

To solve this, we need to determine the unique cycle lengths and how many elements share each cycle length. Then, we have to find how many shuffles it takes for `k` or more elements to return to their original positions by combining these cycle lengths correctly.

Here's the revised solution that should accurately provide the minimum number of shuffles:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function to determine the cycle length for each position in the matrix
def get_cycle_length(pos, size):
    dir_x = [0, 1, 0, -1]  # Directions to move in the x (row)
    dir_y = [1, 0, -1, 0]  # Directions to move in the y (column)
    x, y = 0, 0  # Start from the top-left corner
    dir_idx = 0  # Index to keep track of direction
    for _ in range(1, pos):
        # Move to the next cell in the direction
        x += dir_x[dir_idx]
        y += dir_y[dir_idx]
        # Check for change of direction
        if (dir_idx == 0 and y == size - 1) or (dir_idx == 1 and x == size - 1) or \
           (dir_idx == 2 and y == 0) or (dir_idx == 3 and x == 0):
            dir_idx = (dir_idx + 1) % 4
    # Now that we are at the starting position, we can simulate the cycles
    start_x, start_y = x, y  # Remember the start position
    count = 0
    while True:
        # Move to the next cell in the direction
        x += dir_x[dir_idx]
        y += dir_y[dir_idx]
        count += 1
        # Check for change of direction
        if (dir_idx == 0 and y == size - 1) or (dir_idx == 1 and x == size - 1) or \
           (dir_idx == 2 and y == 0) or (dir_idx == 3 and x == 0):
            dir_idx = (dir_idx + 1) % 4
        # If we reached the start position, break
        if (x, y) == (start_x, start_y):
            break
    return count

# Function to find the minimum number of shuffles for k elements to return to original position
def find_min_shuffles(size, k):
    # Get the cycle lengths for each position
    cycle_lengths = [get_cycle_length(i + 1, size) for i in range(size * size)]
    # Count the occurrences of each cycle length
    cycle_count = {}
    for length in cycle_lengths:
        if length in cycle_count:
            cycle_count[length] += 1
        else:
            cycle_count[length] = 1
    # If we need all elements to return, we find the LCM of all cycle lengths
    if k == size * size:
        shuffles = 1
        for length in cycle_count:
            shuffles = lcm(shuffles, length)
        return shuffles
    # Otherwise, we find the LCM of the cycle lengths that cover at least k elements
    total_elements = 0
    shuffles = 1
    for length in sorted(cycle_count, reverse=True):
        if total_elements + cycle_count[length] >= k:
            return max(shuffles, length)
        shuffles = lcm(shuffles, length)
        total_elements += cycle_count[length]
    return shuffles

# Read the input data
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the minimum number of shuffles
shuffles = find_min_shuffles(n, k)

# Write the output data
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(shuffles) + '\n')
```

The `find_min_shuffles` function calculates the cycle lengths for all positions in the spiral matrix, counts how many times each cycle length occurs, and then finds either the LCM of all cycle lengths (if `k` equals the total number of elements) or the maximum cycle length that covers at least `k` elements (otherwise). This approach should now yield the correct result for the given problem.

Please run this corrected script with the input file `spirala.in` containing `4 9`. It should produce the expected output `2`.
