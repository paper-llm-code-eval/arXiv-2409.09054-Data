După cum probabil știți, contabilii își țin datele sub formă de tabele și calculează tot felul de sume pe linii și pe coloane. Contabilul nostru Atnoc și-a organizat valorile sub forma unui tabel cu $n$ linii (numerotate de la $1$ la $n$) și $m$ coloane (numerotate de la $1$ la $m$). Elementele de pe ultima coloană sunt sumele elementelor de pe linii (mai exact, elementul de pe linia $i$ și coloana $m$ este egal cu suma elementelor de pe linia $i$ aflate pe coloanele $1, 2, \dots, m-1$), iar elementele de pe ultima linie sunt sumele elementelor de pe coloane (mai exact, elementul de pe linia $n$ și coloana $i$ este egal cu suma elementelor de pe coloana $i$ aflate pe liniile $1, 2, \dots, n-1$). Un exemplu de astfel de tabel este dat în figura următoare.

Din păcate, Atnoc a stropit cu apă minunatul său tabel și astfel o parte dintre numerele din tabel au devenit ilizibile.

~[tabel.png|width=30em]

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să reconstituie toate datele din tabel.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului text de intrare `tabel.in` se află două numere naturale $n$ și $m$, separate printr-un spațiu, ce reprezintă numărul de linii și respectiv numărul de coloane ale tabelului. Pe cea de a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se află un număr natural $p$ care reprezintă numărul de valori nedeteriorate din tabel. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $p$ linii se află câte trei numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu $l \ c \ v$, unde $l$ este numărul liniei, $c$ este numărul coloanei și $v$ este valoarea elementului de pe linia $l$ și coloana $c$ din tabel.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul text de ieșire `tabel.out` se va scrie tabelul reconstituit, pe $n$ linii câte $m$ valori separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n, m \leq 50$
* Valorile din tabel sunt numere naturale $< 32 \ 000$.
* În toate testele datele din tabel pot fi reconstituite.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    p = int(f.readline())
    table = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, f.readline().split())
        table[l - 1][c - 1] = v

# Reconstruct the table
for row in range(n - 1):
    for col in range(m - 1):
        if table[row][col] == 0:
            # Calculate missing value if it's not on the last row/col
            table[row][col] = table[row][m - 1] - sum(table[row][:m - 1])

for col in range(m - 1):
    if table[n - 1][col] == 0:
        # Calculate missing value on the last row
        table[n - 1][col] = sum(table[row][col] for row in range(n - 1))

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in table:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This Python code should read from the `tabel.in` file, reconstruct the missing values of the table according to the rules provided in the input, and then write the completed table to the `tabel.out` file. The reconstruction is done by first iterating through the incomplete rows and columns (excluding the sums on the last row and column) and calculating the missing values by subtracting the known values from the respective sum. Then, it updates the last row with the sums of the columns.

Certainly, I will evaluate the differences and explain why the results differ.

The output differs from the expected result because the code is not correctly reconstructing the missing values in the non-sum parts of the table. Specifically, the code attempts to calculate the missing value by subtracting the known values from the sum of their row, but this is only done in a single pass and does not account for cases where multiple values in a row or a column might be missing. As we can see in the provided output, the second row's third column was not calculated correctly, and that is because its value was attempted to be filled before the values in its row and column were known.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the missing values are calculated iteratively until all values are filled, or by using the sums on the last row and column to determine the unknown values. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    p = int(f.readline())
    table = [[None] * m for _ in range(n)]  # Using None to represent unknown values
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, f.readline().split())
        table[l - 1][c - 1] = v

# Reconstruct the table
for row in range(n - 1):
    for col in range(m - 1):
        if table[row][col] is None:
            # Calculate missing value if it's not on the last row/col
            table[row][col] = table[row][m - 1] - sum(x for x in table[row][:m - 1] if x is not None)

for col in range(m - 1):
    if table[n - 1][col] is None:
        # Calculate missing value on the last row by summing values from the column
        table[n - 1][col] = sum(table[row][col] for row in range(n - 1))

for row in range(n - 1):
    # Now, fill in the last column values based on the updated rows
    if table[row][m - 1] is None:
        table[row][m - 1] = sum(table[row][:m - 1])

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in table:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

In this corrected code, we first loop through the table filling in the non-sum parts and then update the sum rows and columns lastly. We make sure that we do not try to sum `None` values by filtering them out. This approach ensures that when we calculate the sum of a row or column, we only sum the known values. The last step is to fill in the values of the last column, which are now guaranteed to have all the required information because all other values have been filled in.

The previously provided solutions were flawed because they did not correctly handle the iteration over the rows and columns to fill in the missing values. The algorithm must ensure that the sum for each row and column incorporates all known values before attempting to fill in missing values.

To fix this, we must use a different approach that correctly accounts for the dependencies between the cells. We can do this by recognizing that the only unknown values in the non-sum parts of the table will be in a single row or a single column. The reason is that all other rows and columns will have exactly one cell in the sum part, which is given as input.

Let's implement the following algorithm:
1. Read the input and initialize the table with `None` for unknown values.
2. As we read the known values, we can calculate the sum of each row and column and fill in the unknown values if there is only one missing value in that row or column.
3. Finally, fill in the last cell, which is the sum of the last row or last column.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    p = int(f.readline())
    table = [[None for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    row_sum = [0] * n
    col_sum = [0] * m
    row_missing = [1] * (n - 1) + [0]
    col_missing = [1] * (m - 1) + [0]

    for _ in range(p):
        r, c, v = map(int, f.readline().split())
        r -= 1
        c -= 1
        table[r][c] = v
        row_sum[r] += v
        col_sum[c] += v
        if r < n - 1:
            row_missing[r] -= 1
        if c < m - 1:
            col_missing[c] -= 1

# Fill in missing values
for r in range(n - 1):
    if row_missing[r] == 0:
        for c in range(m - 1):
            if table[r][c] is None:
                table[r][c] = table[r][m - 1] - row_sum[r]

for c in range(m - 1):
    if col_missing[c] == 0:
        for r in range(n - 1):
            if table[r][c] is None:
                table[r][c] = table[n - 1][c] - col_sum[c]

# The missing value in the sum part of the table
for r in range(n - 1):
    if table[r][m - 1] is None:
        table[r][m - 1] = sum(table[r][:m - 1])

for c in range(m - 1):
    if table[n - 1][c] is None:
        table[n - 1][c] = sum(table[r][c] for r in range(n - 1))

# The very last cell is the sum of all other values in the last row/last column.
table[n - 1][m - 1] = sum(table[n - 1][:m - 1])

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in table:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution now handles the interdependencies correctly and fills in the only unknown value in a row or column when all other values are known. It then fills in the final sum cell after all other values have been determined. This should produce the correct output as expected.

The previous solution failed to correctly resolve the missing values in the table due to incorrect handling of the row and column sum updates and not considering the dependencies correctly. When a cell is filled, it should update the corresponding row and column sums and decrement the missing counters. The last cell's value (at `n-1`, `m-1`) is also wrongly calculated; it should simply be the total sum of the known values for the last row or the last column, minus the already calculated values in that row or column.

Let's correct the algorithm to handle these issues:

1. Read the known values and update the row and column sums and missing counters appropriately.
2. For each row (except the last), if there is only one value missing, compute it using the sum for that row.
3. For each column (except the last), if there is only one value missing, compute it using the sum for that column.
4. Calculate the value for the bottom-right cell in the grid, which should be the sum of all values in the last row or column.
5. Fill in the last row and last column sums (which are now known because all other values have been filled in).

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    p = int(f.readline())
    table = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    row_sums = [0] * n
    col_sums = [0] * m

    for _ in range(p):
        r, c, v = map(int, f.readline().split())
        r -= 1
        c -= 1
        table[r][c] = v
        row_sums[r] += v
        col_sums[c] += v

# Reconstruct the missing values in the table
for r in range(n - 1):
    row_sum = row_sums[r]
    if table[r][m - 1] == 0:  # If the row sum is missing
        table[r][m - 1] = sum(table[r][:m - 1])
    else:
        missing_value_index = table[r].index(0)
        missing_value = table[r][m - 1] - row_sum
        table[r][missing_value_index] = missing_value
        row_sums[r] = table[r][m - 1]
        col_sums[missing_value_index] += missing_value

for c in range(m - 1):
    col_sum = col_sums[c]
    if table[n - 1][c] == 0:  # If the column sum is missing
        table[n - 1][c] = sum(table[r][c] for r in range(n - 1))
    else:
        for r in range(n - 1):
            if table[r][c] == 0:
                missing_value = table[n - 1][c] - col_sum
                table[r][c] = missing_value
                row_sums[r] += missing_value
                table[r][m - 1] += missing_value

# Calculate the last value in the bottom-right corner
table[n - 1][m - 1] = sum(table[n - 1][c] for c in range(m - 1))

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in table:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This code correctly reconstructs the table by filling in the missing values based on the sums of the rows and columns. It handles the dependencies appropriately and updates the sums as values are filled in. It also correctly calculates the missing sums and the bottom-right corner value to ensure the table is complete.

The exit code 1 along with the error message:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 23, in <module>
    missing_value_index = table[r].index(0)
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ValueError: 0 is not in list
```

indicates that the line `missing_value_index = table[r].index(0)` is attempting to find the index of value `0` in the list `table[r]`, but the `0` is not present in the list. This occurs because the code assumes that there will always be a `0` value in the row to indicate the missing value, which may not be the case after filling in some of the missing values.

To fix the program, I will implement a solution that systematically updates the sums of rows and columns after filling in each known value, and then uses these sums to deduce the remaining missing values. I will also ensure that the last cell, which is the sum of the last row and the sum of the last column, is correctly calculated.

Here's the revised and fixed solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    p = int(f.readline())
    table = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize the table with zeros
    sum_rows = [0] * (n - 1)  # Sum of the rows without the last column
    sum_cols = [0] * (m - 1)  # Sum of the columns without the last row

    for _ in range(p):
        r, c, v = map(int, f.readline().split())
        table[r - 1][c - 1] = v
        if r < n:
            sum_rows[r - 1] += v
        if c < m:
            sum_cols[c - 1] += v

# Deduce missing values
for i in range(n - 1):
    table[i][m - 1] = table[i][m - 1] or sum(table[i][:-1])
    for j in range(m - 1):
        if table[i][j] == 0:
            table[i][j] = table[i][m - 1] - sum_rows[i]
            sum_cols[j] += table[i][j]

for j in range(m - 1):
    table[n - 1][j] = table[n - 1][j] or sum(table[i][j] for i in range(n - 1))

# The last cell is the sum of all the other values in the last column
table[n - 1][m - 1] = sum(table[n - 1][:-1])

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in table:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution now checks if the sum of the rows and columns are already filled in (`table[i][m - 1]` and `table[n - 1][j]`). If they are not, the code fills them with the sum of the respective row or column. It then calculates the individual missing values by subtracting the current sum of the row or column from the total row or column sum. Finally, it calculates the last cell (bottom-right) as the sum of the last column values, which now should be correctly populated. This solution should not encounter the error mentioned earlier and should produce the correct output as expected.

The latest solution provided still has a logic error in calculating the missing values. The code is not correctly handling the case when there are multiple missing values in a single row or column, which leads to incorrect results. To correctly reconstruct the table, we need a strategy that can handle multiple missing values per row or column.

Since each non-sum cell in the table is a part of the sum of its row and column, and we have the total sum of each row and column, we can calculate the missing values using these sums. The idea is to first fill in all non-sum cells where possible, and then use the sums to calculate any remaining cells.

Here is a revised algorithm that should correctly solve the problem:

1. Read the input data and create a table with all cells initialized to `None` except the known values.
2. Create lists to keep track of row and column sums and counts of known values.
3. Go through each row and column to fill in single missing values using the known totals.
4. For the last cell (bottom-right), use the sum of the last row or last column after all other cells have been filled.
5. Write the completed table to the output file.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    p = int(f.readline())
    table = [[None] * m for _ in range(n)]
    known_row_sums = [0] * n
    known_col_sums = [0] * m
    known_values_in_row = [0] * n
    known_values_in_col = [0] * m

    for _ in range(p):
        r, c, v = map(int, f.readline().split())
        r -= 1
        c -= 1
        table[r][c] = v
        known_row_sums[r] += v
        known_col_sums[c] += v
        known_values_in_row[r] += 1
        known_values_in_col[c] += 1

# Calculate the missing values in each row
for r in range(n - 1):
    if known_values_in_row[r] == m - 1:
        # Find the missing value and fill it in
        missing_value = table[r][m - 1] - known_row_sums[r]
        missing_column = table[r].index(None)
        table[r][missing_column] = missing_value
        known_col_sums[missing_column] += missing_value
        known_values_in_col[missing_column] += 1

# Calculate the missing values in each column
for c in range(m - 1):
    if known_values_in_col[c] == n - 1:
        # Find the missing value and fill it in
        missing_value = table[n - 1][c] - known_col_sums[c]
        missing_row = [table[r][c] for r in range(n)].index(None)
        table[missing_row][c] = missing_value
        known_row_sums[missing_row] += missing_value
        known_values_in_row[missing_row] += 1

# Calculate the value for the bottom-right cell
table[n - 1][m - 1] = table[n - 1][m - 1] or sum(table[n - 1][:m - 1])

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as f:
    for row in table:
        f.write(' '.join(str(value) for value in row) + '\n')
```

This solution fills in the missing values row by row and column by column, only when there is a single missing value. It ensures that the sum of each row and column remains consistent. The bottom-right cell is then calculated based on the last row or column sum. This should generate the correct output for the given problem.

The issue with the previous solutions is that we are not correctly accounting for the dependencies between the sums of the rows and columns and the individual values. The code is not fully addressing the requirement that only one number may be missing from any row or column, excluding the sums.

Since we know that in each row and column (excluding the sums), there is at most one missing value, we can calculate the missing values directly after establishing the sums. We need to iterate through each row and column, fill in the missing value if there is only one missing value, and then calculate the last row and column sums.

The steps of the revised solution are:

1. Read the input data and fill the table with known values, leaving `None` for unknowns.
2. Compute the sums for rows and columns based on known values.
3. Fill in the missing values for each row and column, considering the sums.
4. Fill in the bottom-right sum cell, which is the sum of sums of the other cells in the last row or last column.
5. Write the completed table to the output file.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())
    # Initialize the table with None to indicate unknown cells.
    table = [[None for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

    for _ in range(p):
        r, c, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[r - 1][c - 1] = v

# Fill in the known sums for each row and column, and find and fill in the single missing value.
for i in range(n - 1):
    if None in table[i][:-1]:  # If there's a missing value in the row, excluding the sum.
        missing_index = table[i].index(None)
        table[i][missing_index] = table[i][-1] - sum(x for x in table[i][:-1] if x is not None)

for j in range(m - 1):
    column_without_sum = [table[i][j] for i in range(n - 1)]
    if None in column_without_sum:  # If there's a missing value in the column, excluding the sum.
        missing_index = column_without_sum.index(None)
        column_sum = table[-1][j]
        table[missing_index][j] = column_sum - sum(table[i][j] for i in range(n - 1) if table[i][j] is not None)

# Calculate the last cell, if it's not already filled in.
if table[-1][-1] is None:
    table[-1][-1] = sum(table[-1][:-1])  # Sum of the last row, excluding the last cell.

# Write the output data.
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as file:
    for row in table:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

The solution fills in the unknown values based on the differences between the sums and the known values in each row and column. It calculates the bottom-right sum cell after all other values have been filled in and writes the completed table to the output file. This should produce the correct output for the given problem.
