Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Să considerăm următorul şir:

`a`$,$ `b`$,$ `ba`$,$ `bab`$,$ `babba`$,$ `babbabab`$, \dots$

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine care este cel de-al $n$-lea termen al şirului

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `sir.in` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul natural $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `sir.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care se află al $n$-lea termen din şir

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 20$;

Example:
`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
bab
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read the input
with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())

# The base strings for a and b
a = 'a'
b = 'b'

# Function to generate the nth term of the sequence
def generate_seq(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 'a'
    elif n == 2:
        return 'b'
    else:
        return generate_seq(n - 1) + generate_seq(n - 2)

# Generate the nth term
result = generate_seq(n)

# Write the output
with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(result)
```

This code reads the number `n` from the file `sir.in`, generates the nth term of the sequence, and writes it to the file `sir.out`. The function `generate_seq` uses recursion to build the string by concatenating the previous two terms. Note that this code is written for clarity and understandability; there are more efficient ways to generate the sequence if performance is a critical issue, especially for larger values of `n`. However, given the restriction that `n` will not exceed 20, this solution is sufficient and will complete in a reasonable amount of time.
