Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Read the number n from file "sir.in"
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generating the n-th term of the sequence
def generate_sequence(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 'a'
    elif n == 2:
        return 'b'
    else:
        prev = generate_sequence(n - 1)
        return prev + prev[::-1]

# Writing the n-th term to file "sir.out"
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(generate_sequence(n))
```

This Python code block reads the number n from the file `sir.in`, generates the n-th term of the sequence by calling the `generate_sequence` function recursively, and writes the result to the file `sir.out`. The `generate_sequence` function bases its recursion on the way the sequence is constructed, appending the reverse of the previous term to itself each time, and handles the base cases for `a` and `b` individually. However, due to the constraints of the problem (n <= 20), this naive recursive solution is sufficient. For larger values of n, a more efficient approach that doesn't rely on recursion would be needed to avoid stack overflow errors and excessive computation.

The result differs from the expected output because the implemented function `generate_sequence` incorrectly constructs the sequence. Instead of appending the reverse of the entire previous term to itself, it should only append the reverse of the first character of the previous term.

A revised algorithm would need to construct each term by appending the reverse of the first character of the previous term, not the reverse of the entire previous term.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the number n from file "sir.in"
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generating the n-th term of the sequence
def generate_sequence(n):
    # Initialize the sequence with the first two elements
    sequence = ['a', 'b']
    # Build the sequence up to the nth element
    for i in range(2, n):
        # Add the reverse of the first character of the previous term to itself
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-1][0][::-1])
    return sequence[n-1]

# Writing the n-th term to file "sir.out"
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(generate_sequence(n))
```

This solution now correctly interprets the pattern of the sequence and generates the n-th term accordingly. It uses an iterative approach to build the sequence up to the requested term, which is more efficient than the initial recursive attempt, and it also avoids the potential issue of reaching the maximum recursion depth for higher values of n within the given constraints.

The output differs from the expected result because the logic to append the reverse of the first character of the previous term was incorrect. In the attempted fix, it was still reversing the whole string and then incorrectly accessing the first character.

To correct this, the generating function needs to take the previous term and append only the reverse of its first character. Here is the correct implementation:

```python
# Read the number n from file "sir.in"
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Function to generate the nth term of the sequence
def generate_nth_term(n):
    # Starting terms of the sequence
    if n == 1:
        return 'a'
    if n == 2:
        return 'b'
    
    # Generate the sequence iteratively
    seq = ['a', 'b']
    for i in range(2, n):
        # Append the reverse of the first character of the previous term
        seq.append(seq[-1] + seq[-1][0][::-1])
    
    return seq[-1]

# Generate the nth term and write it to "sir.out"
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(generate_nth_term(n))
```

This code should correctly calculate the n-th term in the sequence and write the result to "sir.out". The revised `generate_nth_term` function constructs the sequence iteratively, appending the reverse of the first character of the last term to itself to create the next term. This implementation should now correctly produce the expected output for the given input of 4, which is "bab".

The previous code still does not produce the correct output because it was incorrectly appending the reverse of the entire last term to itself. According to the pattern, for the nth term, we should take the (n-1)th term and append the reverse of it, and then take the first character of this new string and append it to the end.

Now let's implement the correct solution:

```python
# Read the number n from file "sir.in"
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generating the n-th term of the sequence
def generate_sequence(n):
    a, b = 'a', 'b'  # The first two elements of the sequence
    for _ in range(2, n):
        a, b = b, b + a[::-1]  # Generate next term
    return b

# Writing the n-th term to file "sir.out"
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(generate_sequence(n))
```

In this revised solution, we use an iterative approach to build the sequence. We keep track of the last two elements of the sequence, `a` and `b`, and in each iteration, we update `a` to be the previous `b`, and update `b` to be the concatenation of the previous `b` with the reverse of `a`. This correctly follows the sequence's pattern, and should now output "bab" for the input of 4.
