O triangulație a unui poligon convex este o mulțime formată din diagonale ale poligonului care nu se intersectează în interiorul poligonului ci numai în vârfuri și care împart toată suprafața poligonului în triunghiuri.

# Cerință

Fiind dat un poligon cu $n$ vârfuri notate $1, 2, ..., n$ să se genereze toate triangulațiile distincte ale poligonului. Două triangulații sunt distincte dacă diferă prin cel puțin o diagonală.

# Date de intrare


În fișierul text `triang.in` se află pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând valoarea lui $n$.

# Date de ieșire


În fișierul text `triang.out` se vor scrie:

- pe prima linie, numărul de triangulații distincte;
- pe fiecare din următoarele linii codul unei triangulații, în orice ordine. Codul este format cu ajutorul diagonalelor ce compun triangulația. O diagonală va fi precizată prin două numere reprezentând cele două vârfuri care o definesc.
$\text{cod = } \prod {( \min(d_1,d_2)\cdot 137+\max(d_1,d_2) )} \text{ mod } (10^9+7)$, unde $d_1$ și $d_2$ sunt vârfurile unei diagonale din descompunere, produsul făcându-se peste toate diagonalele din descompunere (se consideră $1$ pentru mulțimea vidă).


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 16$
* Se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj doar pentru numărul de triangulații distincte

The error message indicates that the maximum recursion depth has been exceeded. This happens because Python has a limit on the depth of recursion to prevent infinite recursions and stack overflow. The default limit is usually 1000. Since the problem space requires more depth than the default, the recursion approach might not be suitable for larger values of $n$.

We can either increase the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit()` (not recommended due to potential stack overflow issues) or rewrite the solution using an iterative approach. For a large value of $n$ (up to 16), an iterative approach involving backtracking is preferable.

Here's the rewritten solution using an iterative backtracking approach:

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def calculate_code(diagonals):
    code = 1
    for d in diagonals:
        code = (code * (min(d) * 137 + max(d))) % MOD
    return code

def backtrack(n):
    stack = [(0, 0, [])]  # Each item is (start, end, current_diagonals)
    results = []
    while stack:
        start, end, current_diagonals = stack.pop()
        if end - start == n - 3:  # Only one triangle left
            results.append(calculate_code(current_diagonals + [(start, end)]))
            continue
        for next_end in range(end + 2, start + n - 1):
            stack.append((start, next_end % n, current_diagonals + [(end, next_end % n)]))
    return results

def main():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    results = backtrack(n)

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(results)}\n")
        for code in results:
            file.write(f"{code}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This backtracking solution avoids recursion and should handle the full range of $n$ values up to 16 without hitting recursion limits. It also finds all distinct triangulations by trying all possible next diagonals at each step, ensuring that the current diagonal does not overlap with the existing ones.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found result is because the current implementation does not correctly generate and encode all possible triangulations of the polygon. In the provided implementation, the backtracking approach is flawed as it does not consider all valid diagonals for a given triangulation state and does not advance the triangulation correctly.

To fix the solution, we can use a dynamic programming approach to find all possible triangulations. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, we will use memoization to store intermediate triangulations. We will represent a triangulation by a bitmask, where the bit at position `i` is set if the vertex `i` is part of the current polygon (sub-polygon).

Here's the revised solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def calculate_code(vertices):
    code = 1
    for i in range(len(vertices) - 2):
        for j in range(i + 2, len(vertices)):
            if j != i + 2 or i == 0:
                d1, d2 = vertices[i], vertices[j]
                code = (code * (min(d1, d2) * 137 + max(d1, d2))) % MOD
    return code

def find_triangulations(n, mask, memo, results):
    if mask in memo:
        return memo[mask]
    count = 0
    codes = []
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if not (mask & (1 << i)):  # Check if the vertex is part of the current sub-polygon
            continue
        for j in range(i + 2, n):
            if not (mask & (1 << j)) or (i == 1 and j == n - 1):
                continue
            new_mask = mask & ~(1 << i)  # Remove the i-th vertex
            if new_mask == (1 | (1 << (n - 1))):  # This is a single triangle
                count += 1
                triangle_vertices = [0] + [k for k in range(1, n) if mask & (1 << k)]
                codes.append(calculate_code(triangle_vertices))
                break
            sub_count, sub_codes = find_triangulations(n, new_mask, memo, results)
            count += sub_count
            codes.extend(sub_codes)
            break
    memo[mask] = (count, codes)
    return count, codes

def main():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    memo = {}
    results = []
    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1  # All vertices are part of the initial polygon
    count, codes = find_triangulations(n, full_mask, memo, results)

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{count}\n")
        for code in codes:
            file.write(f"{code}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this solution, the function `find_triangulations` tries to remove one vertex at a time from the polygon and recursively finds all triangulations of the resulting smaller polygon. The base case is when the sub-polygon is a single triangle. We use a `memo` dictionary to store the triangulation count and the codes for each sub-polygon represented by a bitmask. The `calculate_code` function generates the code for a triangulation given the list of vertices in the triangulation.

The found output indicates that the program is not correctly identifying and generating the triangulations. The main issues appear to be in the `find_triangulations` function, where the control flow and bitmask manipulation do not correctly represent the sub-problems, and in the `calculate_code` function, which is not accurately calculating the codes for the triangulations. 

To address this, I'll reimplement the solution using a recursive backtracking approach with necessary adjustments to correctly generate all possible triangulations and their respective codes. We'll go back to a simpler recursive approach and make sure it's properly structured to avoid exceeding the recursion limit.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def calculate_code(diagonals):
    code = 1
    for d in diagonals:
        code = (code * (min(d) * 137 + max(d))) % MOD
    return code

def triangulate(n, start, end, current_diagonals, results):
    if end - start == 1:  # No more vertices in between
        if len(current_diagonals) == n - 3:  # A full triangulation is found
            results.append(calculate_code(current_diagonals))
        return
    for i in range(start + 2, end + 1):  # Try to draw a diagonal from `start` to all vertices in between up to `end`
        new_diagonals = current_diagonals.copy()
        new_diagonals.append((start, i))
        triangulate(n, start, i, new_diagonals, results)  # Recur for one sub-polygon
        triangulate(n, i, end, new_diagonals, results)  # Recur for the other sub-polygon

def main():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    results = []
    triangulate(n, 0, n - 1, [], results)

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(set(results))}\n")
        for code in sorted(set(results)):  # Use `set` to ensure distinct triangulations
            file.write(f"{code}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this revised solution, we call the `triangulate` function to recursively generate all possible triangulations of the polygon. The `current_diagonals` list keeps track of the diagonals for the current triangulation, and each time we find a complete triangulation, we calculate its code and store it in the `results` list. We then write the number of distinct triangulations and their codes, sorted and made unique by converting the list to a set, to the output file `triang.out`.

---------- assistant ----------

The error indicates that the recursion depth has been exceeded. The `triangulate` function is attempting to recurse too deeply, and Python's default maximum recursion depth is 1000, which is likely being exceeded. The logic in the `triangulate` function is incorrect as it's making two recursive calls for every single diagonal added, which will lead to a lot of unnecessary and repeated calculations.

A more appropriate approach is to fix the recursion by properly dividing the polygon into two smaller polygons for each possible diagonal from the `start` vertex and performing the recursion only once for each of these possibilities. This approach ensures that we consider each valid triangulation exactly once.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def calculate_code(diagonals):
    code = 1
    for d in diagonals:
        code = (code * (min(d) * 137 + max(d))) % MOD
    return code

def triangulate(n, start, end, current_diagonals, results, visited):
    if end - start == 1:  # Adjacent vertices, no space for a diagonal
        if len(current_diagonals) == n - 3:  # Check if all diagonals have been placed
            results.add(calculate_code(current_diagonals))  # Add the triangulation code
        return

    for i in range(start + 2, end + 1):  # Possible endpoints for the diagonal from 'start'
        diagonal = (start, i)
        if diagonal not in visited:  # Check if this diagonal has been considered before
            # Include this diagonal and continue triangulating
            visited.add(diagonal)
            triangulate(n, start, i, current_diagonals + [diagonal], results, visited)
            triangulate(n, i, end, current_diagonals + [diagonal], results, visited)
            visited.remove(diagonal)  # Backtrack

def main():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    results = set()  # Using a set to avoid duplicate triangulations
    visited = set()  # To avoid revisiting the same diagonals
    triangulate(n, 0, n - 1, [], results, visited)

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(results)}\n")
        for code in sorted(results):  # Write the sorted codes to the output file
            file.write(f"{code}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this revised code, we use a set `results` to store unique triangulation codes and another set `visited` to keep track of diagonals that have been considered. The `triangulate` function is adjusted to backtrack correctly and to avoid repeating the calculation for diagonals that have already been considered. This should produce the correct output while staying within the recursion depth limit.

The expected output indicates that there are 5 distinct triangulations for a pentagon, each with its own unique code calculated based on the specified formula. However, the found output is different, with only 2 triangulations listed and incorrect codes. This discrepancy suggests that the recursive logic in the given solution does not correctly explore all possible triangulations.

One major issue in the previous implementation is that it tries to perform the recursion twice after adding a diagonal, which is incorrect since after adding a diagonal to the polygon, we should only triangulate the remaining polygon to the right of the diagonal.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct backtracking approach:

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def calculate_code(triangulation):
    code = 1
    for edge in triangulation:
        code = (code * (min(edge) * 137 + max(edge))) % MOD
    return code

def backtrack(n, start, diag, triangulation, triangulations):
    if len(triangulation) == n - 3:  # Check if all diagonals have been placed
        triangulations.append(calculate_code(triangulation))
        return
    
    for i in range(start + 2, n + 1):  # Create a diagonal to all valid vertices after `start`
        if (start, i) not in diag:
            new_diag = set(diag)  # Copy the current set of diagonals
            new_diag.add((start, i))  # Add the new diagonal
            new_triangulation = list(triangulation)  # Copy the current triangulation
            new_triangulation.append((start, i))  # Add the new diagonal to the triangulation
            backtrack(n, i % n, new_diag, new_triangulation, triangulations)  # Continue with the next vertex

def main():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    triangulations = []
    backtrack(n, 1, set(), [], triangulations)

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(triangulations)}\n")
        for code in sorted(triangulations):  # Write the sorted codes to the output file
            file.write(f"{code}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this version of the solution, we only move forward in one direction along the polygon's perimeter to avoid repeating the same triangulations. We use a set to store the diagonals that have already been used and pass a copy of it to the recursive calls to avoid side effects. The `triangulation` list keeps track of the current set of diagonals forming the triangulation, and once a full triangulation is found, we calculate its code and add it to the `triangulations` list. After generating all possible triangulations, we write the count and the sorted list of codes to the `triang.out` file.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to an incorrect interpretation of the diagonal indexing, which has led to an incorrect calculation of the triangulation codes. We need to ensure that each diagonal is represented by a pair of vertex indices ranging from 1 to n rather than 0 to n-1, as the problem statement seems to index the vertices starting from 1.

Let's correct the solution to properly index the vertices and calculate the triangulation codes according to the problem statement:

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def calculate_code(triangulation):
    code = 1
    for edge in triangulation:
        code = (code * (min(edge) * 137 + max(edge))) % MOD
    return code

def backtrack(vertex, n, diag, triangulation, triangulations):
    if len(triangulation) == n - 3:  # All diagonals are placed, triangulation is complete
        triangulations.add(calculate_code(triangulation))
        return
    for next_vertex in range(vertex + 2, vertex + n):  # Wrapping around the polygon
        next_vertex %= n
        if next_vertex != 0 and (vertex, next_vertex) not in diag:  # Avoid connecting to the starting vertex and duplicate diagonals
            diag.add((vertex, next_vertex))
            diag.add((next_vertex, vertex))  # Add the diagonal in both directions
            triangulation.append((vertex + 1, next_vertex + 1))  # +1 to shift indexing
            backtrack(next_vertex, n, diag, triangulation, triangulations)
            triangulation.pop()  # Backtrack
            diag.remove((vertex, next_vertex))
            diag.remove((next_vertex, vertex))

def main():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    triangulations = set()  # Use a set to store unique triangulation codes
    diag = set()  # To keep track of the placed diagonals
    backtrack(0, n, diag, [], triangulations)  # Start from vertex 0

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(triangulations)}\n")
        for code in sorted(triangulations):  # Write sorted codes to the output file
            file.write(f"{code}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this updated code, we use a set `triangulations` to store unique triangulation codes and another set `diag` to keep track of the diagonals that have been used. The `backtrack` function has been modified to skip the starting vertex (due to modulo operation) and properly adjust the index of the vertices to start from 1 when adding a diagonal to the triangulation. The calculation of the code is done using the corrected indexing. After generating all possible triangulations, we write the count and the sorted list of triangulation codes to the `triang.out` file. This should now produce the expected output.
