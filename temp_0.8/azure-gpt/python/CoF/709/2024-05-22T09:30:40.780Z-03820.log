The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to an incorrect implementation of the algorithm to find the distinct triangulations of the polygon. Specifically, the algorithm currently implemented combines the triangulations of the left and right subpolygons with the newly added diagonal without ensuring the triangulations are compatible (i.e., that they do not cross each other within the polygon).

The problem with the previous implementation seems to be related to the recursive step combining left and right subpolygons, which may create invalid triangulations or miss some valid ones. To correct the solution, we should implement a more suitable algorithm for generating all the triangulations of a convex polygon, such as the one based on Catalan numbers.

However, this seems to be a tricky problem that would require a deeper investigation of the constraints and the characteristics of the problem. Since it's a complex backtracking problem, a dynamic programming approach is generally used to find all possible triangulations. Unfortunately, finding all distinct triangulations and their respective codes is not straightforward and may require a more advanced technique than the current approach.

Let's try to implement a different solution, which correctly solves the problem using dynamic programming and backtracking:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to calculate the hash of a given triangulation
def calc_hash(triangulation):
    result = 1
    for d in triangulation:
        result = (result * (min(d) * 137 + max(d))) % MOD
    return result

# Recursive function to perform backtracking and find all triangulations
def backtrack(n, start, end, visited, current, all_triangulations):
    if end - start == 1:
        all_triangulations.add(calc_hash(current))
        return
    for i in range(start + 1, end):
        diagonal = (start, i)
        if diagonal not in visited:
            visited.add(diagonal)
            current.append(diagonal)
            # Split into two subproblems
            backtrack(n, start, i, visited, current, all_triangulations)
            backtrack(n, i, end, visited, current, all_triangulations)
            # Backtrack
            current.pop()
            visited.remove(diagonal)

# Function to read input, find all triangulations, and write output
def process_triangulations():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())

    all_triangulations = set()
    visited = set()
    backtrack(n, 0, n - 1, visited, [], all_triangulations)

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{len(all_triangulations)}\n")
        for triangulation_hash in sorted(all_triangulations):
            fout.write(f"{triangulation_hash}\n")

# Call the function to execute the triangulation process
process_triangulations()
```

This new solution uses backtracking to ensure that only valid triangulations are considered. It separately handles the base case where the subpolygon is already a triangle (i.e., two consecutive edges with no vertices between) by adding the current triangulation to the set of all triangulations. It also uses a `visited` set to prevent revisiting the same diagonal, which would lead to duplicate triangulations.

The differences between the expected and found output indicate that my previous solution is still incorrect. The algorithm is not generating the correct triangulations, and the backtracking approach is not handling the shape of the polygon properly. It is not enough to just split the polygon into two and recursively solve each part. The algorithm needs to ensure that diagonals are added in such a way that they always result in valid triangulations without intersecting each other.

To fix this, we need to use a proper dynamic programming approach that takes into account the structure of the convex polygon and the nature of triangulations. Given the small input size (maximum `n=16`), we can attempt to generate all possible triangulations using a recursion with memoization strategy.

Let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to calculate the hash of a given triangulation
def calc_hash(diagonals):
    hash_value = 1
    for diag in diagonals:
        hash_value = (hash_value * (min(diag) * 137 + max(diag))) % MOD
    return hash_value

# Recursive function to generate triangulations with memoization
def generate_triangulations(start, end, memo):
    if (start, end) in memo:
        return memo[(start, end)]

    if end - start == 1:
        return [set()]

    triangulations = []
    for middle in range(start + 1, end):
        left_triangulations = generate_triangulations(start, middle, memo)
        right_triangulations = generate_triangulations(middle, end, memo)
        for left in left_triangulations:
            for right in right_triangulations:
                triangulations.append(left | right | {(start, end)})
    
    memo[(start, end)] = triangulations
    return triangulations

# Main function to process triangulations
def process_triangulations():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())

    # Generate all possible triangulations
    memo = {}
    complete_triangulations = generate_triangulations(0, n - 1, memo)

    # Calculate hashes for triangulations and remove duplicates
    hashes = set(calc_hash(t) for t in complete_triangulations)

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('triang.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{len(hashes)}\n")
        for triangulation_hash in sorted(hashes):
            fout.write(f"{triangulation_hash}\n")

# Execute the process
process_triangulations()
```

This solution uses a dictionary `memo` to store the previously computed triangulations, thus avoiding redundant calculations. The recursive function `generate_triangulations` creates all valid triangulations by selecting a 'middle' vertex and combining the triangulations from the left and right sub-polygons with the new diagonal (start, end). After generating all triangulations, we calculate their hashes, remove duplicates, and write them to the output file.

The differences between the expected and found output are due to a logic error in the algorithm. The recursive generation of triangulations is incorrect because it does not consider that a valid triangulation for a polygon with `n` vertices must consist of exactly `n-3` diagonals that partition the polygon into `n-2` triangles.

To ensure valid triangulations, the algorithm must be adapted so that it only adds diagonals that split the polygon into smaller polygons without creating intersections within the polygon. Additionally, the endpoints of the diagonals must be adjusted to account for the correct indices of the vertices in the polygon.

I will now provide a corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def calc_hash(triangulation):
    hash_value = 1
    for diag in triangulation:
        hash_value = (hash_value * (min(diag) * 137 + max(diag))) % MOD
    return hash_value

def generate_triangulations(n, memo):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n < 3:
        return [set()]
    triangulations = []
    for i in range(1, n - 1):  # Choose a diagonal from vertex 0 to vertex i
        left_triangulations = generate_triangulations(i + 1, memo)
        right_triangulations = generate_triangulations(n - i, memo)
        for left in left_triangulations:
            for right in right_triangulations:
                new_triang = {(0, i)} | \
                             {(i, n-1)} | \
                             {(l[0] + i, l[1] + i) for l in right if l[1] < n - 1} | \
                             left
                triangulations.append(new_triang)
    memo[n] = triangulations
    return triangulations

def process_triangulations():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())

    # Generate all possible triangulations
    memo = {}
    triangulations = generate_triangulations(n, memo)
    
    # Calculate hashes for triangulations and remove duplicates
    hashes = {calc_hash(t) for t in triangulations}

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('triang.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{len(hashes)}\n")
        for triangulation_hash in sorted(hashes):
            fout.write(f"{triangulation_hash}\n")

# Execute the process
process_triangulations()
```

In this corrected solution, I'm using a memoization approach to store already computed triangulations for a given number of vertices. For each polygon with `n` vertices, the algorithm selects all possible diagonals going from vertex `0` to vertex `i` and then generates the left and right sub-polygon triangulations recursively. Each right sub-polygon triangulation has its vertices reindexed before being joined with the left sub-polygon and the chosen diagonal to form a complete triangulation.

This solution should now correctly enumerate all distinct triangulations of the convex polygon and calculate their hash codes as per the problem statement.

The differences between the expected and found output suggest that the hashing function or the way of generating the triangulations is incorrect. It seems that the indices for the vertices are not properly handled when reindexing the right sub-polygon triangulations.

The reindexing process within the set comprehension `{(l[0] + i, l[1] + i) for l in right if l[1] < n - 1}` might be incorrectly offsetting the vertices of the right sub-polygon triangulations. Moreover, the problem statement defines the vertices of the polygon as being numbered from `1` to `n`, but my code treats them as if they are numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which affects the correctness of the generated triangulations and their hashes.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution, this time ensuring that vertices are numbered correctly and the reindexing is handled properly. We also need to ensure the base case for the triangulations is properly returned as a set containing an empty set.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to calculate the hash of a given triangulation
def calc_hash(triangulation):
    hash_value = 1
    for diag in triangulation:
        hash_value = (hash_value * (min(diag) * 137 + max(diag))) % MOD
    return hash_value

# Recursive function to generate triangulations with memoization
def generate_triangulations(start, end, memo):
    if (start, end) in memo:
        return memo[(start, end)]

    if end - start <= 1:
        return [set()]

    triangulations = []
    for middle in range(start + 1, end):
        left_triangulations = generate_triangulations(start, middle, memo)
        right_triangulations = generate_triangulations(middle, end, memo)
        for left in left_triangulations:
            for right in right_triangulations:
                # Merge left and right triangulations with the diagonal (start, middle, end)
                triangulations.append(left | right | {(start, end)})
    
    memo[(start, end)] = triangulations
    return triangulations

# Main function to process triangulations
def process_triangulations():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())

    # Generate all possible triangulations
    memo = {}
    complete_triangulations = generate_triangulations(1, n, memo)

    # Calculate hashes for triangulations and remove duplicates
    hashes = set(calc_hash(t) for t in complete_triangulations)

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('triang.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{len(hashes)}\n")
        for triangulation_hash in sorted(hashes):
            fout.write(f"{triangulation_hash}\n")

# Execute the process
process_triangulations()
```

This solution adjusts the vertex numbering to start from `1` and ensures the base case returns a set of an empty set. It handles the recursive generation of triangulations by properly merging left and right sub-polygon triangulations with the added diagonal between `start` and `end`. The memoization dictionary is indexed by `(start, end)` pairs to store and retrieve previously computed triangulations, thereby avoiding redundant calculations. After generating the complete triangulations, we calculate their hashes and write the unique hashes to the output file in sorted order.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to continued issues with the implementation of the triangulation generation and hashing functionality. Let's re-evaluate the problem, taking a step back, and making sure we follow the constraints and hash function described in the problem statement.

The vertices of the polygon are numbered from 1 to n, and we need to generate all possible triangulations without intersecting diagonals. To obtain the hash for each triangulation, we take the product of each diagonal's hash value, where the hash for a diagonal formed by vertices d1 and d2 is calculated as (min(d1, d2) * 137 + max(d1, d2)) modulo (10^9+7).

Let’s rewrite the solution with correct logic:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to calculate the product for the hash of a single diagonal
def diagonal_hash(d1, d2):
    return (min(d1, d2) * 137 + max(d1, d2)) % MOD

# Recursive function to find all triangulations of a polygon given by vertices
def triangulate(vertices, memo):
    if len(vertices) < 3:  # No diagonals possible
        return [1]
    if tuple(vertices) in memo:  # Check for memoized result
        return memo[tuple(vertices)]
    result = []
    for i in range(2, len(vertices)):
        left = vertices[:1] + vertices[i - 1:i + 1]  # Left polygon slice including vertices[0]
        right = vertices[i:] + vertices[:1]  # Right polygon slice including vertices[i]
        left_hashes = triangulate(left, memo)
        right_hashes = triangulate(right, memo)
        for h1 in left_hashes:
            for h2 in right_hashes:
                result.append((h1 * h2 * diagonal_hash(vertices[0], vertices[i])) % MOD)
    memo[tuple(vertices)] = result
    return result

# Function to read input, find triangulations and write output
def process_triangulations():
    with open('triang.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        vertices = list(range(1, n + 1))

    memo = {}
    triangulation_hashes = set(triangulate(vertices, memo))

    with open('triang.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f"{len(triangulation_hashes)}\n")
        for triangulation_hash in sorted(triangulation_hashes):
            fout.write(f"{triangulation_hash}\n")

# Call the function to execute the triangulation process
process_triangulations()
```

In this solution:

1. The `triangulate` function recursively finds all possible triangulations for the given set of vertices.
2. We use memoization to store the results for each vertex subset to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Each time we select a diagonal, we split the polygon into two smaller polygons, triangulate them separately, and then combine the results.
4. The hash for each triangulation is the product of hashes for all its diagonals, computed by the `diagonal_hash` function.
5. The main function `process_triangulations` reads the input, invokes the `triangulate` function, and writes the results to the output file.

This implementation should yield the correct triangulation hashes now, assuming the logic correctly uses the vertices in the range [1, n] and ensures that all diagonals are considered only once.

The exit code 1, accompanied by the traceback indicating a `RecursionError`, suggests that the current implementation of the `triangulate` function exceeds Python's maximum recursion depth. This typically happens when the recursion is too deep and the base case is not reached or correctly processed. In this case, the base case should be when the polygon is reduced to a triangle, which should not recursively call `triangulate` further.

The function should be updated to return a list with a single element (the hash of an empty triangulation, which is 1) when the polygon is indeed a triangle (i.e., when there are exactly 3 vertices). Let's correct the base case and rewrite the solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to calculate the hash of a given triangulation
def calc_hash(triangulation):
    hash_value = 1
    for diag in triangulation:
        hash_value = (hash_value * (min(diag) * 137 + max(diag))) % MOD
    return hash_value

# Recursive function to generate triangulations with memoization
def generate_triangulations(memo, s, e):
    if e - s == 1: # No more diagonals to add
        return [[]]
    if (s, e) in memo:
        return memo[(s, e)]

    result = []
    for m in range(s + 1, e):

This updated solution adds a correct base case check to ensure that we only proceed with recursion when there are more than two vertices between the start and end (i.e., `e - s > 1`). The function `generate_triangulations` is called recursively to combine the results of the left and right subproblems with the current diagonal `(s, e)`. The memoization dictionary `memo` is used to store previously computed results for each subproblem identified by the start and end vertices `(s, e)`. The hashes of the triangulations are then calculated and written to the output file. This should prevent the recursion error and produce the correct output.
