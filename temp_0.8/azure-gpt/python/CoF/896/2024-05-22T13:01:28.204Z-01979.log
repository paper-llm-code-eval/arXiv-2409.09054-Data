Mihai a primit de ziua lui un joc de puzzle. Jocul are $N$ piese confecționate prin lipirea unor bucăți de dimensiune $1 \cdot 1$ (ilustrate în figurile de mai jos prin `X`); aceste bucăți le vom numi în continuare, pe scurt, `X`-uri. Pentru confecționarea unei piese se respectă următoarele reguli:

* `X`-urile sunt așezate unul peste altul, formând coloane ce pot avea înălțimi diferite, apoi coloanele se aliniază în partea de jos și se lipesc între ele, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta;
* Pe o coloană sunt cel mult $9$ `X`-uri;
* Toate piesele au același număr de coloane.

~[puzzle.jpg|align=center]

În figurile $1, 2, 3, 4$ sunt piese de puzzle care respectă regulile descrise, iar în figura $5$ și în figura $6$ **NU** sunt piese de puzzle, pentru că nu pot fi obținute prin lipirea unor coloane de $X$-uri, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta.
Fiind mic, Mihai nu poate rezolva puzzle-ul, dar poate face o singură operație: alege două piese și le îmbină în dreptul laturilor de sus, răsturnând una dintre piese sus-jos (fără să o rotească sau să o răstoarne stânga-dreapta). Dacă în urma acestei operații el obține un dreptunghi format din coloane complete de $X$-uri, toate coloanele având aceeași înălțime, este mulțumit. De exemplu, piesa din figura $1$ și cea din figura $2$ pot fi îmbinate în modul descris.
În figura $7$ este piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos. În figura $8$ este ilustrat dreptunghiul care se obține din piesa din figura $1$ și piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos.
Observați că, dacă am roti piesa din figura $4$, am putea să o îmbinăm cu piesa din figura $1$, dar rotația nu este permisă.
Vom codifica o piesă printr-un număr natural, fiecare cifră din număr reprezentând (în ordine de la stânga la dreapta) câte $X$-uri se află pe coloana corespunzătoare din piesă.
De exemplu:
- piesa din figura $1$ este codificată $4232$;
- piesa din figura $2$ este codificată $1323$;
- piesa din figura $3$ este codificată $4444$;
- piesa din figura $4$ este codificată $3231$.

# Cerință

Determinați care este numărul de moduri în care Mihai poate alege câte două piese dintre cele $N$ pentru a face o operație în modul descris mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `puzzle.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă numărul de piese din joc. Pe linia a doua se găsesc $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, reprezentând codificările celor $N$ piese.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `puzzle.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris numărul cerut.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$;
* Numerele care reprezintă codificările pieselor au același număr de cifre (cel mult $5$) și nu conțin cifra $0$.
* Într-o operație nu contează care dintre piese este răsturnată, ca urmare perechea formată din piesa $a$ și piesa $b$ este considerată ca fiind aceeași cu perechea formată din piesa $b$ și piesa $a$.
* Dreptunghiul obținut în urma unei operații poate avea înălțimea mai mare decât $9$.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $N \leq 1 \ 000$.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it seems that my initial approach was incorrect. The logic for the formation of the rectangle was based on the sum of the flipped and original columns, which is not correct. Instead, I should have been checking whether the heights of the columns could complement each other to form a rectangle of the same height.

I will reimplement the solution using a different approach:

1. Iterate through each piece and determine its flipped representation, where the flipped value for a column with height `h` is `10 - h`.
2. For each piece, create a tuple that represents its flipped state.
3. Store these tuples in a dictionary to count occurrences of each flipped state.
4. Iterate through the dictionary and for each flipped state, check if there is a matching original state that complements it to form a rectangle. A flipped state is a match for an original state if the sum of corresponding column heights equals 10.
5. Use combination formula to count the total possible pairs for each matching state.

Here is the revised solution:```python
# Read the input data from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(str, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Prepare a dictionary to store occurrences of each piece and its flipped state
piece_counts = {}
flipped_counts = {}

# Process each piece and its flipped version
for piece in pieces:
    flipped_piece = ''.join(str(10 - int(digit)) for digit in piece)
    piece_counts[piece] = piece_counts.get(piece, 0) + 1
    flipped_counts[flipped_piece] = flipped_counts.get(flipped_piece, 0) + 1

# Count the number of ways to combine pieces to form a rectangle
combos = 0
for piece, count in piece_counts.items():
    if piece in flipped_counts:
        # Each piece can be paired with any of its flipped counterparts
        combos += count * flipped_counts[piece]

# Since each pair is counted twice (once for each piece in the pair), divide by 2 
combos //= 2

# Write the output data to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(combos))
```

This solution will count each pair only once, as required by the problem statement, and should produce the correct number of combinations to form a rectangle.

Upon further evaluation, it appears that the previous implementation did not properly handle the problem's requirement of combining puzzle pieces by flipping one and checking if they can form a complete rectangle. Specifically, it incorrectly assumed that a piece and its flipped version could form a valid combination, which is not necessarily true.

Let's develop a correct algorithm:

1. Convert each piece into a tuple representing the count of 'X's in each column.
2. Create the flipped version of each piece by subtracting each 'X' count from the maximum height (which in this case is 9) to represent flipping the piece upside down.
3. Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each original and flipped piece representation.
4. Iterate over the dictionary to calculate combinations of pieces that can be paired to form a complete rectangle. For each piece representation, the height of any two columns can be paired if their heights add up to 9.
5. The final count of valid combinations will be the sum of these pairings.

Now, let's rewrite the solution:```python
def get_flipped_representation(piece):
    # Convert each digit to an integer and flip it by subtracting from 9
    return tuple(9 - int(digit) for digit in str(piece))

# Read the input data from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = [int(piece) for piece in file.readline().strip().split()]

# Use a dictionary to track the count of each piece representation and its flipped version
representation_count = {}

# Process each piece
for piece in pieces:
    # Get the representation of the piece as a tuple
    representation = tuple(int(digit) for digit in str(piece))
    # Get the flipped representation
    flipped_representation = get_flipped_representation(piece)

    # Increment the count for the piece's representation and its flipped version
    representation_count[representation] = representation_count.get(representation, 0) + 1
    representation_count[flipped_representation] = representation_count.get(flipped_representation, 0) + 1

# Count the number of ways to combine pieces to form a rectangle
combos = 0
for representation, count in representation_count.items():
    # Skip representations that can't be paired with others
    if count < 2:
        continue
    # Calculate combinations
    combos += count * (count - 1) // 2

# Output the number of combinations
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(combos))
```

This solution processes each piece, calculates its flipped representation, and uses a dictionary to count how many times each representation occurs. It then iterates through these counts, calculating the number of combinations for each representation using the combination formula. Finally, it outputs the result to `puzzle.out`.

It seems the previous solution still misunderstood the flipping mechanism of the puzzle pieces. To correctly solve the problem, we need to pair pieces in such a way that when one is flipped, the sum of corresponding column heights from both pieces equals 9 for each column. The solution should find flipped versions of each piece and pair them with original pieces that, when summed column-wise, give 9.

To fix this, we'll adapt the algorithm as follows:

1. For each piece, calculate the flipped piece where each column height is subtracted from 9.
2. Use this flipped piece as a key in a dictionary and store the original piece in the value list.
3. Iterate over all pieces, and for each piece, look up its flipped version in the dictionary to find potential matches.
4. For each match found, increment the count (while ensuring that no piece is paired with itself).
5. Write the result to the output file.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = file.readline().strip().split()

# Prepare a dictionary to map flipped pieces to their original versions
flipped_pieces = {}

# Process each piece to find its flipped version and store in the dictionary
for piece in pieces:
    flipped = ''.join(str(9 - int(x)) for x in piece)
    if flipped not in flipped_pieces:
        flipped_pieces[flipped] = []
    flipped_pieces[flipped].append(piece)

# Count the number of valid combinations
count = 0
for piece in pieces:
    flipped = ''.join(str(9 - int(x)) for x in piece)
    if flipped in flipped_pieces:
        # Exclude self-pairing
        count += len(flipped_pieces[flipped]) - flipped_pieces[flipped].count(piece)

# Each combination has been counted twice, so divide by 2
count //= 2

# Write the output data to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(count))
```

This solution now properly handles the flipping and pairing of puzzle pieces and should yield the expected result.

The previous solution incorrectly tried to match flipped versions of pieces with each other instead of checking if a piece can be combined with another to form a rectangle with the columns of 9 units high. The goal is not to find self-pairings or pairs of identical pieces, but to identify pairs of distinct pieces that complement each other when one is flipped.

The algorithm should:
1. Create a representation for each piece as a tuple of its column heights.
2. For each piece, calculate the complement that would be required to form a complete rectangle when one piece is flipped.
3. Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each original piece representation.
4. For each piece, check if its complement exists in the dictionary. If it does, add the number of these complements to the count.
5. Divide the result by 2, as each pair will be counted twice.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Read the input data from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces_str = file.readline().strip().split()

# Convert each piece to a tuple of its column heights
pieces = [tuple(int(char) for char in piece) for piece in pieces_str]

# Prepare a dictionary to count occurrences of each piece representation
piece_representation_count = {}
for piece in pieces:
    piece_representation_count[piece] = piece_representation_count.get(piece, 0) + 1

# Count the number of ways to combine pieces to form a rectangle
combos = 0
for piece in pieces:
    # Calculate the complement to form a rectangle of 9 units high
    complement = tuple(9 - column for column in piece)
    # Check if the complement exists
    if complement in piece_representation_count:
        if complement != piece:
            combos += piece_representation_count[complement]
        else:
            # If complement is the same as the piece, ensure not to count it with itself
            combos += piece_representation_count[complement] - 1

# Divide by 2 to account for duplicates (each pair is counted twice)
combos //= 2

# Write the output data to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(combos))
```

This solution should give the correct number of combinations that can form a complete rectangle, and thus should produce the expected output for the given input.

The previous attempts to solve the problem were incorrect because they failed to properly account for the fact that a piece and its complement (when one is flipped) should form a complete rectangle with all column heights summing up to 9. The problem lies in how we are accounting for these combinations and ensuring that each piece is only paired with another distinct piece.

To correctly solve the problem, we will:

1. Iterate over each piece and determine its "inverted" version, where 9 minus the height of each column of the piece gives us the height needed from another piece to complete the rectangle.
2. Store the counts of these inverted versions in a dictionary.
3. For each piece, look up its inverted version in the dictionary. If found, it means the original piece can be paired with the pieces corresponding to the inverted version to complete the rectangle.
4. Increment our counter for each valid pairing.
5. Since each pair is counted twice (once for each piece), we will divide the final count by 2.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations:

```python
# Read the input data from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = file.readline().strip().split()

# Function to calculate the inverted version of a piece
def inverted(piece):
    return ''.join(str(9 - int(x)) for x in piece)

# Calculate the inverted representation for each piece and count their occurrences
inverted_counts = {}
for piece in pieces:
    inv = inverted(piece)
    if inv in inverted_counts:
        inverted_counts[inv] += 1
    else:
        inverted_counts[inv] = 1

# Count the number of valid combinations
combos = 0
for piece in pieces:
    inv = inverted(piece)
    # Ensure we are not pairing a piece with itself
    if piece in inverted_counts:
        combos += inverted_counts[piece] - 1

# Since we counted each combination twice (once for each piece), divide by 2
combos //= 2

# Write the output data to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(combos))
```

This solution should correctly match pieces with their complements and account for the number of ways Mihai can combine them to form a complete rectangle, producing the expected output of 3 for the given input.

The results continue to differ because the previous solutions have not correctly identified pairings of distinct pieces. The inverted piece should not simply be the flipped version of a piece, but instead, it should represent the complement piece needed to form a complete rectangle when one piece is flipped upside down. The inverted piece should therefore have column heights that, when added to the corresponding heights of the original piece, equal 9.

Let's revise the approach:

1. Convert each piece's representation into a tuple of integers representing the column heights.
2. Calculate the complement of each column height (9 minus the height) to represent the piece that would complete it when flipped.
3. Use a dictionary to store the counts of these complements.
4. For each piece, check if its complement is in the dictionary, which indicates a potential match.
5. Increment the count for each match found, excluding self-pairings.
6. Since each pair is counted twice, divide the final count by 2.

Here is the fixed solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Read the input data from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = map(str, file.readline().strip().split())

# Convert each piece to a tuple of its column heights and calculate the complement
complements = {}
for piece in pieces:
    piece_tuple = tuple(map(int, piece))
    complement = tuple(9 - height for height in piece_tuple)
    # If the complement exists, this is a valid pairing
    if complement in complements:
        complements[complement] += 1
    else:
        complements[complement] = 1

# Count the number of valid pairings
count = 0
for piece in complements:
    # The complement of a complement is the original piece,
    # so we can just check if the piece is its own complement
    if piece in complements:
        if piece != tuple(9 - height for height in piece):  # Ensure not counting self-pairings
            count += complements[piece] * complements[tuple(9 - height for height in piece)]
        else:
            # For self-complementing pieces, we need to handle them separately
            count += complements[piece] * (complements[piece] - 1)

# Divide the count by 2 because each pair has been counted twice
count //= 2

# Write the output data to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(count))
```

This solution should now properly count the number of ways Mihai can combine the pieces to form a complete rectangle, giving us the expected result of 3 for the given input.
