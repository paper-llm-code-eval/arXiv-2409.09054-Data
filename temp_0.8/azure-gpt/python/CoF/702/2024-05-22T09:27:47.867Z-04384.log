Directorul unei școli dorește să premieze la sfârșitul anului școlar pe cei mai buni elevi la învățătură. Pentru acest lucru el are de rezolvat două probleme:

1. Să determine câți elevi vor fi premiați dintre cei $n$ elevi ai școlii. După discuții aprinse cu ceilalți profesori se hotărăște în Consiliul Profesoral ca numărul premianților să fie $n - k$, unde $k$ este cel mai mare număr pătrat perfect mai mic strict decât $n$. De exemplu, pentru $n = 150$, $k$ este $144$ (pentru că $144$ = $12^2$), deci vor fi premiați $150 - 144 = 6$ elevi.
2. Pentru a fi cât mai multă liniște la premiere, în Consiliul Profesoral se ia decizia ca elevii care nu vor fi premiați să fie așezați pe terenul de sport pe rânduri de câte $p$ elevi (unde $p^2 = k$). În acest scop, directorul a numerotat elevii nepremiați de la $1$ la $k$ și a hotărât ca elevii să fie așezați în ordinea descrescătoare a numerelor asociate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de elevi din școală și calculează numărul de elevi premiați precum și modul de așezare a elevilor nepremiați.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `lascoala.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `lascoala.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul de elevi premiați, iar pe următoarele linii așezarea elevilor nepremiați.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 700$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# lascoala.py
import math

# Read input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the largest square less than n
p = math.isqrt(n - 1)  # Integer square root
k = p * p              # Largest square less than n
premiati = n - k       # Number of awarded students

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of awarded students
    file.write(f"{premiati}\n")
    
    # Write the arrangement of non-awarded students
    for row in range(p, 0, -1):
        for col in range(p):
            file.write(f"{row + col * p} ")
        file.write("\n")
```

Please ensure that `lascoala.in` contains the input number as specified and `lascoala.out` is the desired output file. The script does not use `input()` or `print()` to interact with the files.

The output differs because the arrangement of non-awarded students is in ascending order from left to right, while it should be in descending order. To fix this, we can calculate the value to be written by starting from `k` (the largest square less than `n`) and subtracting rather than adding the row and column indices.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# lascoala.py
import math

# Read input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the largest square less than n
p = math.isqrt(n - 1)  # Integer square root
k = p * p              # Largest square less than n
premiati = n - k       # Number of awarded students

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of awarded students
    file.write(f"{premiati}\n")
    
    # Write the arrangement of non-awarded students
    for row in range(p - 1, -1, -1):
        for col in range(p - 1, -1, -1):
            file.write(f"{k - (row * p + col)} ")
        file.write("\n")
```

This updated code writes the non-awarded students' arrangement in descending order as required. Please run this script in an environment where the `lascoala.in` file is present with the input data. The script will produce the `lascoala.out` file with the correct expected output.

I apologize for the oversight. In the previous solution, I did not properly reverse the order of the students. Let's correct this mistake.

To ensure the arrangement starts with the highest number (`k`) at the top-right and ends with `1` at the bottom-left, we need to iterate through each row from `p` to `1` and within each row from `p` to `1` in their respective loops. We also need to calculate the student's number by subtracting the current position from `k + 1`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
import math

# Read input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the largest square less than n
p = math.isqrt(n - 1)  # Integer square root
k = p * p              # Largest square less than n
premiati = n - k       # Number of awarded students

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of awarded students
    file.write(f"{premiati}\n")
    
    # Write the arrangement of non-awarded students
    # Start from k and decrement
    num = k
    for _ in range(p):
        for _ in range(p):
            file.write(f"{num} ")
            num -= 1
        file.write("\n")
```

This code now correctly calculates the seating arrangement such that the highest number is at the top-right, and the lowest number (1) is at the bottom-left, meeting the problem's requirements. Please save this script in the same directory as the `lascoala.in` file, and it will produce the `lascoala.out` file as expected.

My apologies for any confusion. The output in the latest solution provided matches the expected output presented in your example. However, I notice an inconsistency in the way the output is displayed. In the expected output, there is no space after the last number in each row. To adhere to this format, we should adjust the code to not add a space after the last number in each row.

Here's the corrected solution that takes care of the trailing space:

```python
import math

# Read input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the largest square less than n
p = math.isqrt(n - 1)  # Integer square root
k = p * p              # Largest square less than n
premiati = n - k       # Number of awarded students

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the number of awarded students
    file.write(f"{premiati}\n")
    
    # Write the arrangement of non-awarded students
    # Start from k and decrement
    for row in range(p, 0, -1):
        for col in range(p, 0, -1):
            num = (row - 1) * p + col
            if col > 1:
                file.write(f"{num} ")
            else:
                file.write(f"{num}")
        file.write("\n")
```

This code will now correctly format the output to not include a trailing space at the end of each line, matching the expected output format. Please save this script to a `.py` file, place it in the same directory as the `lascoala.in` file, and it will produce the `lascoala.out` file as required.
