Directorul unei școli dorește să premieze la sfârșitul anului școlar pe cei mai buni elevi la învățătură. Pentru acest lucru el are de rezolvat două probleme:

1. Să determine câți elevi vor fi premiați dintre cei $n$ elevi ai școlii. După discuții aprinse cu ceilalți profesori se hotărăște în Consiliul Profesoral ca numărul premianților să fie $n - k$, unde $k$ este cel mai mare număr pătrat perfect mai mic strict decât $n$. De exemplu, pentru $n = 150$, $k$ este $144$ (pentru că $144$ = $12^2$), deci vor fi premiați $150 - 144 = 6$ elevi.
2. Pentru a fi cât mai multă liniște la premiere, în Consiliul Profesoral se ia decizia ca elevii care nu vor fi premiați să fie așezați pe terenul de sport pe rânduri de câte $p$ elevi (unde $p^2 = k$). În acest scop, directorul a numerotat elevii nepremiați de la $1$ la $k$ și a hotărât ca elevii să fie așezați în ordinea descrescătoare a numerelor asociate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de elevi din școală și calculează numărul de elevi premiați precum și modul de așezare a elevilor nepremiați.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `lascoala.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `lascoala.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul de elevi premiați, iar pe următoarele linii așezarea elevilor nepremiați.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 700$;

The discrepancy in the output arises from the arrangement logic within the `write_arrangement` function. The current logic prints the numbers in a different order than required. To match the expected output, we need to adjust the inner loop to generate numbers in descending order for each row.

Let's fix the `write_arrangement` function so that it populates the rows as expected:

```python
import math

# Function to write arrangement of non-premiated students to the file
def write_arrangement(k, file):
    p = int(math.sqrt(k))
    for row in range(p, 0, -1):
        for col in range(p - 1, -1, -1):
            # Calculate the student number and write it in the correct order
            file.write(str(p * col + row) + " ")
        file.write("\n")  # Newline after each row

# Main function to process the input and output files
def main():
    with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    # Calculate the largest perfect square less than n
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    premiated = n - k  # Number of premiated students

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(premiated) + "\n")  # Number of premiated students
        write_arrangement(k, file)  # Arrangement of non-premiated students

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each row, we are printing the numbers starting from the highest `p * col + row` to the lowest in that row, which should match the expected output.

The output differs because the order of the numbers within each row is incorrect. The rows are being populated column by column, while the requirement is to populate them row by row in descending order. We must adjust the logic to fill each row from right to left.

Here's the revised solution with the necessary fix:

```python
import math

# Function to write arrangement of non-premiated students to the file
def write_arrangement(k, file):
    p = int(math.sqrt(k))
    # Start with the highest number and decrease
    for number in range(k, 0, -1):
        file.write(str(number) + " ")
        # After writing p numbers, insert a newline
        if number % p == 1:
            file.write("\n")

# Main function to process the input and output files
def main():
    with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    # Calculate the largest perfect square less than n
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    premiated = n - k  # Number of premiated students

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(premiated) + "\n")  # Number of premiated students
        write_arrangement(k, file)  # Arrangement of non-premiated students

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This new solution directly writes the numbers in descending order, ensuring that each row is filled from the highest number on the right to the lowest number on the left. After every `p` numbers, a newline is inserted to start a new row. The corrected code will produce the expected output as per the given example.

It appears there was an oversight in the previous solution's output formatting. The issue is related to the additional space at the end of each line.

To match the expected output exactly, we need to ensure that there is no trailing space at the end of each row. Let's fix the `write_arrangement` function to handle this:

```python
import math

# Function to write arrangement of non-premiated students to the file
def write_arrangement(k, file):
    p = int(math.sqrt(k))
    for row in range(p, 0, -1):
        line = " ".join(str(row + p * col) for col in range(p - 1, -1, -1))
        file.write(line.strip() + "\n")  # Stripping any extra spaces before writing the line

# Main function to process the input and output files
def main():
    with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    # Calculate the largest perfect square less than n
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    premiated = n - k  # Number of premiated students

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(premiated) + "\n")  # Number of premiated students
        write_arrangement(k, file)  # Arrangement of non-premiated students

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With this adjustment, each line is stripped of any trailing spaces before being written to the file, which should provide the expected output format.

The previous solution had a bug in the ordering of the numbers within each row. The numbers should be written in descending order starting from $k$ and going down to $1$, filling each row from left to right. The corrected `write_arrangement` function should create each row by determining the starting number for that row and then counting down by one until the row is filled.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
import math

# Function to write arrangement of non-premiated students to the file
def write_arrangement(k, file):
    p = int(math.sqrt(k))
    for start in range(k, 0, -p):  # Determine the starting number for each row
        row_numbers = [str(start - i) for i in range(p)]  # Create list of numbers in the row
        file.write(" ".join(row_numbers) + "\n")  # Write the row to the file

# Main function to process the input and output files
def main():
    with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

    # Calculate the largest perfect square less than n
    k = int(math.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2
    premiated = n - k  # Number of premiated students

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(premiated) + "\n")  # Write the number of premiated students
        write_arrangement(k, file)  # Write the arrangement of non-premiated students

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of the solution should produce the expected output, with numbers in each row listed in descending order from left to right, and each row beginning with the next lower number from the previous row's starting number.
