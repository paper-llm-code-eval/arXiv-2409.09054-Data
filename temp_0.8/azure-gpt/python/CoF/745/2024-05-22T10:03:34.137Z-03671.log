Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

    # The last movement is only a horizontal jump, so we can consider the minimum from the last row excluding the last column
    min_cost = float('inf')

It seems there was a mistake in my initial solution. I did not correctly handle the traversal logic, specifically for the horizontal jumps. According to the rules, we cannot jump from a cell to itself, which was not taken into account. Let's correct the algorithm and rewrite the solution considering this rule.

```python
def read_matrix_and_dimensions():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    return matrix, m, n

def write_minimum_sum(min_sum):
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(min_sum))

def find_minimum_traversal_sum(matrix, m, n):
    # Initializing the cost matrix with the values from the input matrix
    cost = [[float('inf') for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

    # Pre-filling the second row (as the first jump can only go down)
    for column in range(1, n):
        cost[1][column] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][column]
    
    # Dynamic programming to fill in the rest of the cost matrix
    for row in range(2, m):
        for from_column in range(n):
            for to_column in range(n):
                if from_column != to_column:
                    new_cost = cost[row - 1][from_column] + matrix[row - 1][to_column] + matrix[row][to_column]
                    if new_cost < cost[row][to_column]:
                        cost[row][to_column] = new_cost
    
    # Final jump to the bottom-right corner
    min_sum = float('inf')
    for column in range(n - 1):
        if cost[m - 1][column] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1] < min_sum:
            min_sum = cost[m - 1][column] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1]

    return min_sum

# Read the matrix and its dimensions
matrix, m, n = read_matrix_and_dimensions()
# Calculate the minimum sum for the traversal
min_sum = find_minimum_traversal_sum(matrix, m, n)
# Write the minimum sum to the output file
write_minimum_sum(min_sum)
```

This corrected solution reads the input from `lacusta.in`, finds the minimum sum for the traversal using dynamic programming, and writes the calculated minimum sum to `lacusta.out`. The fix involved correctly handling the horizontal jumps and not jumping from a cell to itself, as well as properly handling the pre-filling of the second row and the final jump to the bottom-right corner.

Apologies for the oversight. It appears I misunderstood the rules of the traversal. After re-evaluating the problem, I realized that the traversal should consider the minimum path sum while avoiding horizontal jumps to the same cell.

Let's correct the algorithm. We need to find the two smallest values in the previous row (excluding the current column), then add the smaller of the two to the current cell if the current cell is not in the same column as the smallest, otherwise add the second smallest.

```python
# Corrected Python solution

def calculate_min_traversal(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # The cost of the first cell is its value
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

    # Calculate cost for the second row
    for col in range(1, n):
        cost[1][col] = cost[0][0] + matrix[1][col]

    # Calculate minimum cost for the rest of the rows
    for row in range(2, m):
        for col in range(n):
            # Find two smallest values in the previous row excluding the current column
            smallest, second_smallest = float('inf'), float('inf')
            for k in range(n):
                if cost[row-1][k] < smallest:
                    second_smallest = smallest
                    smallest = cost[row-1][k]
                elif cost[row-1][k] < second_smallest:
                    second_smallest = cost[row-1][k]

            # If current column is the smallest, use the second smallest
            if cost[row-1][col] == smallest:
                cost[row][col] = second_smallest + matrix[row][col]
            else:
                cost[row][col] = smallest + matrix[row][col]

    # Calculate the final jump to the bottom-right cell
    final_costs = [cost[m-2][col] + matrix[m-1][col] for col in range(n-1)]
    min_cost = min(final_costs) + matrix[m-1][n-1]

    return min_cost

# Function to read the matrix from the input file
def read_matrix(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    return matrix, m, n

# Function to write the result to the output file
def write_result(file_path, result):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

# Main function to solve the problem
def main():
    matrix, m, n = read_matrix('lacusta.in')
    result = calculate_min_traversal(matrix, m, n)
    write_result('lacusta.out', result)

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This updated solution first reads the matrix from `lacusta.in`, then it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum path sum according to the traversal rules, and finally writes the result to `lacusta.out`. The critical update is in the selection of the two smallest values from the previous row to correctly calculate the minimum cost of each cell in the current row.

I apologize for the confusion. After carefully reviewing the problem and the previous attempts, it seems that I made a mistake in handling the algorithmic part, specifically in selecting the two smallest values from the previous row. The selection of the smallest and second smallest needs to be done carefully to ensure that we don't pick the value from a column that leads to the current cell.

Let's implement the solution with a corrected approach and validate it against the given example:

```python
def read_matrix_from_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())  # Read dimensions
        matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]  # Read the matrix
    return matrix, m, n

def write_result_to_file(file_name, result):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def find_min_cost(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the DP array with infinity
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The cost of the first cell is its value
    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
    
    # Fill the second row based on the problem's unique movement rule
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[1][j] = dp[0][0] + matrix[1][j]
    
    # Start calculating the path from the third row to the last row
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # We need to find the minimum two values in the previous row
            # while ensuring we are not taking the same column
            previous_row = dp[i-1][:]
            previous_row[j] = float('inf')  # Exclude same column jump
            min1 = min(previous_row)
            min1_idx = previous_row.index(min1)
            previous_row[min1_idx] = float('inf')
            min2 = min(previous_row)
            dp[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + min(min1, min2)
    
    # Final step is to reach the bottom-right corner from the second last row
    last_row = dp[m-1][:]
    last_row[-1] = float('inf')  # Exclude last cell, can't jump to itself
    result = matrix[m-1][n-1] + min(last_row)
    
    return result

# Main logic
matrix, m, n = read_matrix_from_file('lacusta.in')  # Read input
min_sum = find_min_cost(matrix, m, n)  # Process input to find solution
write_result_to_file('lacusta.out', min_sum)  # Write output
```

This solution should now correctly compute the minimum cost to traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner following the problem's traversal rules. It avoids horizontal jumps to the same cell and considers the minimum path sum at each step. The final result is written to `lacusta.out`.

I apologize again for the oversight. Let's re-evaluate the problem and come up with a corrected solution. In the traversal from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, we have to ensure we're taking the minimum path that adheres to the constraints, which are:

1. We cannot move to the same column in a horizontal jump.
2. We must visit 2 cells in each row, except the last row, where we just make a horizontal jump to the rightmost cell.

Given these constraints, we need to find the minimum cost to reach the penultimate row, then perform a horizontal jump to the last cell in the rightmost column. We need to adjust the algorithm to handle these constraints properly. Let's try a different approach:

```python
def read_input():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    return matrix, m, n

def write_output(min_cost):
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(min_cost))

def find_min_cost(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    costs = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The cost of the first cell is its value
    costs[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
    
    # Calculate the costs for the second row
    for col in range(1, n):
        costs[1][col] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][col]

    # Calculate the minimum costs for each cell starting from the third row
    for row in range(2, m):
        for col in range(n):
            # Find the minimum cost for the current cell
            for prev_col in range(n):
                if prev_col != col:
                    cost = costs[row - 1][prev_col] + matrix[row][col] + matrix[row - 1][col]
                    if cost < costs[row][col]:
                        costs[row][col] = cost

    # The last move is to pick the smallest cost in the penultimate row excluding the last column
    min_cost_last_row = min(costs[m - 2][col] for col in range(n - 1))

    # Add the cost of the last cell in the matrix to the minimum cost found
    min_cost_last_row += matrix[m - 1][n - 1]

    return min_cost_last_row

matrix, m, n = read_input()
min_cost = find_min_cost(matrix, m, n)
write_output(min_cost)
```

This updated solution should now correctly calculate the minimum traversal cost for the given matrix by following the provided constraints. The input is read from the file `lacusta.in`, the processing is done to find the minimum cost, and the output is written to `lacusta.out`.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and devise a correct approach. The challenge requires us to traverse the matrix in a specific way, ensuring that we cannot jump from a cell to itself horizontally, and we need to consider the cost of both cells visited in each row except for the last jump to the bottom-right corner.

Given these rules, we need to calculate the minimum cost for each cell properly. Here's a revised solution:

```python
def read_matrix():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    return matrix, m, n

def write_min_cost(min_cost):
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(min_cost))

def calculate_min_cost(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost_matrix = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The cost of the first cell is its own value
    cost_matrix[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
    
    # Pre-fill the second row using the first cell's value
    for col in range(1, n):
        cost_matrix[1][col] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][col] * 2

    # Calculate the cost for the rest of the rows
    for row in range(2, m):
        for col in range(n):
            # Find the minimum cost to reach the current cell from the previous row
            for prev_col in range(n):
                if prev_col != col:  # We cannot jump to the same column
                    new_cost = cost_matrix[row - 1][prev_col] + matrix[row][col] + matrix[row - 1][col]
                    if new_cost < cost_matrix[row][col]:
                        cost_matrix[row][col] = new_cost
    
    # Add the minimum cost from the penultimate row (excluding the last column) to the last cell's value
    min_cost = min(cost_matrix[m - 2][:n - 1]) + matrix[m - 1][n - 1]

    return min_cost

# Read matrix from input file
matrix, m, n = read_matrix()
# Calculate the minimum cost
min_cost = calculate_min_cost(matrix, m, n)
# Write minimum cost to output file
write_min_cost(min_cost)
```

This solution reads the matrix from `lacusta.in`, computes the minimum cost to traverse according to the given rules, and writes the result to `lacusta.out`. The main change here is that we fill the second row using the value of the first cell, and for every other row, we calculate the minimum cost while considering the need to avoid jumping to the same column. The final cost is determined by adding the minimum value from the penultimate row (excluding the last column) to the value of the bottom-right corner cell.

It appears the previous solutions were incorrect due to misunderstanding the traversal rules and how to apply them algorithmically. I'll correct the solution by considering the unique traversal path and the minimum sum for each step. Let's re-evaluate the algorithm and fix the solution:

To summarize, the traversal rules are:
1. We can only move down or horizontally in the same row, but we cannot stay in the same column after moving horizontally.
2. We visit each row exactly twice, except the last row where we only move horizontally to the last column.

Here's a corrected Python solution:

```python
def calculate_min_path_cost(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the DP array with high values
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Start from the first cell
    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
    
    # The first move must be to the second row, so prefill the DP array accordingly
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][j]

    # Fill in the DP array for the rest of the rows
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # To find the minimum cost to reach (i, j), we need to consider all previous positions in row i-1
            # and take the minimum cost out of them, making sure that we are not coming from the same column j
            for k in range(n):
                if k != j:  # We can't move horizontally to the same column
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i-1][j])

    # To reach the final cell, we must come from any cell in the last row, except the final cell itself
    # So, we take the minimum value of the penultimate row and add the value of the final cell
    final_cost = min(dp[m-2][k] for k in range(n-1)) + matrix[m-1][n-1]

    return final_cost

# Read the matrix from the input file
matrix, m, n = read_matrix('lacusta.in')

# Calculate the minimum cost for the traversal
min_cost = calculate_min_path_cost(matrix, m, n)

# Write the result to the output file
write_result('lacusta.out', min_cost)
```

Make sure to include the `read_matrix` and `write_result` functions from the previous solutions.

This revised solution should now properly compute the minimum cost to traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner following the problem's traversal rules. It also ensures that we never jump to the same column when performing horizontal movements. After calculating the DP table with these rules, we find the minimum value in the penultimate row (excluding the last column) and add the bottom-right corner's value to find the final cost. The result is then written to `lacusta.out`.
