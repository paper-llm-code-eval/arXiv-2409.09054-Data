Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Code to solve the lacusta challenge

def find_min_sum(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]  # Start at the top-left corner

    # Fill the first row of the cost matrix
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[0][j] = matrix[0][j] + cost[0][j-1]

    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == m-1 and j == n-1:
                # Find the minimum for the bottom-right corner
                for k in range(n):
                    if k != j:
                        cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j])
            else:
                for k in range(n):
                    if k != j:
                        # Find the minimum cost to reach the current cell
                        cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i+1][j])
    
    return cost[m-1][n-1]

with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as infile:
    m, n = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, infile.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

min_sum = find_min_sum(matrix, m, n)

with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(min_sum))
```

This code reads the matrix from `lacusta.in`, computes the minimum sum for the traversal as per the specified rules, and writes the result to `lacusta.out`. It ensures that the last movement is only a horizontal jump to the bottom-right corner, and it takes into account the constraint that each move consists of a horizontal jump followed by a vertical step (except the last move). The cost matrix keeps track of the minimum sum to reach each cell, and the final result is the value in the bottom-right corner of the cost matrix.

The error shown indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means that the code is attempting to access an index in the matrix that does not exist. This is happening because the code is trying to access `matrix[i+1][j]` when `i + 1` is out of range for the last row.

To correct the issue, we need to adjust the logic to ensure we don't access an index beyond the last row. Additionally, we should address the logic for the first row and first column, as the traversal starts at the top-left corner and it is not allowed to jump from the first cell to itself.

Here's the revised and corrected solution:

```python
# Code to solve the lacusta challenge

def find_min_sum(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = 2 * matrix[0][0]  # Start at the top-left corner, cost doubled as we visit it twice

    # Fill the first column of the cost matrix
    for i in range(1, m):
        cost[i][0] = matrix[i][0] + cost[i-1][0]

    # Calculate the minimum cost for each cell
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            # For the last row, we can only jump horizontally
            if i == m - 1:
                for k in range(n):
                    if k != j:
                        cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j])
            else:
                # Find the minimum cost to reach the cell below the current one
                for k in range(n):
                    if k != j:
                        cost[i+1][j] = min(cost[i+1][j], cost[i][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i+1][j])

    # The traversal ends at the last row, so we take the minimum cost at the bottom-right corner
    return cost[m-1][n-1] - matrix[0][0]  # Subtract the doubled cost of the starting cell

# Read from lacusta.in
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as infile:
    m, n = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, infile.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Find the minimum sum
min_sum = find_min_sum(matrix, m, n)

# Write to lacusta.out
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(min_sum))
```

This corrected version initializes the cost matrix correctly, taking into account that we visit the starting cell twice. It also properly handles the first column and the last row of the matrix. The result is then written to `lacusta.out` as required.

The provided solution didn't adhere to the problem's constraints, particularly around the traversal rules. The key issue here is that the traversal for each row is incorrectly implemented. According to the problem, we must make a horizontal jump (to any cell in the same row), followed by a vertical step to the cell immediately below it. This continues until we reach the last row, at which point we make a final horizontal jump to the bottom-right corner cell.

The previous solution was incorrectly updating the cost for cells in the same row and making vertical steps at the same time, which is not allowed. We need to calculate the minimum cost for a horizontal jump to every cell in the next row after making the vertical step.

Let's rewrite the solution with a proper implementation:

```python
# Code to solve the lacusta challenge

def find_min_sum(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The starting cell is visited only once at the beginning
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

    # Process the second row, which is the first one where Lacusta can land after a jump and a step
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][j] + matrix[0][j]

    # Compute the cost for the subsequent rows
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Find the minimum cost for a horizontal jump for the next step
            for k in range(n):
                if k != j:
                    # The cost of reaching the current cell and making a jump to the next row
                    temp_cost = cost[i - 1][j] + matrix[i][k]
                    # Update the cost of the cell in the next row if it's lower than the current
                    cost[i][k] = min(cost[i][k], temp_cost)

            # Add the cost of the vertical step to all cells in the next row
            for j in range(n):
                cost[i][j] += matrix[i][j]

    # Calculate the final jump to the bottom-right corner
    min_final_jump = float('inf')
    for k in range(n - 1):  # We don't consider the last column as we can't jump from it to itself
        min_final_jump = min(min_final_jump, cost[m - 1][k])

    return min_final_jump + matrix[m - 1][n - 1]

# Read from lacusta.in
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as infile:
    m, n = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, infile.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Find the minimum sum
min_sum = find_min_sum(matrix, m, n)

# Write to lacusta.out
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(min_sum))
```

This solution first sets the cost of moving from the starting cell to all possible cells in the second row. Then, for each subsequent row, it computes the cost of horizontal jumps from every cell in the previous row, and adds the vertical step cost to the current row. Finally, it finds the minimum cost required to make the last jump to the bottom-right corner. This cost is then written to `lacusta.out`.

The issue with the previous implementations is that the logic for calculating the cost matrix did not correctly implement the movement constraints. According to the problem, each move consists of a horizontal jump followed by a vertical step (except the last move which is just a horizontal jump to the bottom-right corner). This means the cost of moving to the next row must consider the minimum cost from all possible previous positions, excluding the cost of jumping to the same column.

I will now implement a corrected solution with an explanation:

1. Initialize two rows for DP, `prev_row` and `curr_row` to store minimum costs.
2. The first cell (0,0) is visited without a cost, so we can set it to `0` (since we return to it).
3. Start filling `prev_row` from the second cell (0,1) with horizontal moves from the first cell.
4. For each subsequent row, calculate the cheapest cost to reach each cell using the following steps:
   a. Find two minimum values in `prev_row` excluding the current column.
   b. For each cell in the current row (`curr_row`), calculate the cost as the value of the cell plus the second minimum if the cell's column matches the column of the first minimum, otherwise add the first minimum.
5. Remember to process the last row separately since it will not involve a vertical step.
6. Write the minimum cost from the last row's DP values to the output file.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
# Code to solve the lacusta challenge

def find_two_smallest(exclude_index, values):
    # Find the smallest and second smallest values excluding the one at exclude_index
    smallest = second_smallest = float('inf')
    for idx, val in enumerate(values):
        if idx != exclude_index:
            if val <= smallest:
                smallest, second_smallest = val, smallest
            elif val < second_smallest:
                second_smallest = val
    return smallest, second_smallest

def find_min_sum(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize DP rows
    prev_row = [float('inf')] * n
    # The starting cell is visited without a cost, we will add this cost at the end
    prev_row[0] = 0

    # Process the first row (horizontal jumps)
    for j in range(1, n):
        prev_row[j] = matrix[0][j] + matrix[0][0]

    # Compute the cost for the subsequent rows
    for i in range(1, m):
        curr_row = [float('inf')] * n
        # Find two smallest values from previous row
        smallest, second_smallest = find_two_smallest(-1, prev_row)
        for j in range(n):
            # Choose the second smallest if we're in the same column as the smallest
            prev_min = second_smallest if prev_row[j] == smallest else smallest
            curr_row[j] = matrix[i][j] + prev_min

        prev_row = curr_row

    # Add the cost to jump back to the starting cell (0,0) which is excluded from the path
    return prev_row[n-1] + matrix[0][0]

# Read from lacusta.in
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as infile:
    m, n = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, infile.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Find the minimum sum
min_sum = find_min_sum(matrix, m, n)

# Write to lacusta.out
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(min_sum))
```

This solution focuses on the constraints of the problem and uses dynamic programming to only store necessary row information. It avoids unnecessary computation by keeping track of the two smallest values in the previous row. This should provide the correct output as per the problem statement.

Upon evaluating the problem again, I found that my previous implementation still did not follow the traversal rules correctly. I apologize for the oversight, and I'll provide a new solution now.

For this problem, we need to keep track of the cost of reaching each cell in the matrix. Because we can't jump to the same column we're currently in, we need to find the minimum cost of reaching the cells in the next row from other columns in the current row.

The correct approach for this problem is to use dynamic programming. We can calculate the minimum cost to reach each cell in the current row by looking at all possible previous row cells (excluding the same column) and then adding the cost of the current cell. In addition, for the last row, we only consider horizontal jumps to reach the last cell at the bottom-right corner.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Code to solve the lacusta challenge

def find_min_sum(matrix, m, n):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The starting cell is visited without a cost
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

    # Process the second row separately as it's the base case for our DP approach
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][j] + matrix[0][j]

    for i in range(2, m):
        # For each cell in the current row
        for j in range(n):
            # Find the minimum cost to reach this cell from the previous row (excluding the same column)
            for k in range(n):
                if k != j:  # Exclude the same column
                    cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i-1][j])

    # For the last move, find the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right corner
    # excluding the cost of moving to the last column as we can't jump from it to itself
    last_move_cost = float('inf')
    for j in range(n - 1):  # Exclude the last column
        last_move_cost = min(last_move_cost, cost[m-1][j] + matrix[m-1][n-1])

    return last_move_cost

# Read from lacusta.in
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as infile:
    m, n = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, infile.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Find the minimum sum
min_sum = find_min_sum(matrix, m, n)

# Write to lacusta.out
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(min_sum))
```

This implementation attempts to address the traversal rules correctly. It calculates the minimum cost for each row, excluding jumps to the same column, and considers the last move separately since it's just a horizontal jump to the bottom-right corner. The solution should now provide the correct output.
