Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

The difference between the expected and found result stems from a flaw in the function `find_min_path_cost` that calculates the cost of the last move. The error is due to the fact that the function incorrectly tries to target the bottom-right corner directly from the second-to-last row, which is not allowed by the problem's rules.

According to the problem statement, we must visit exactly $2 \cdot m$ cells. This means that when we're on the second-to-last row, we cannot directly jump to the last cell in the last row. Instead, we have to make a horizontal jump to any cell on the last row except for the last one, then move vertically down to the last row, and then make the final horizontal jump to the bottom-right corner.

Let's correct the implementation by considering this constraint, and rewrite the code to include this fix.

```python
# Function to find the minimum path cost
def find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat):
    # Initialize a matrix to store the minimum cost at each cell
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The first cell cost is its value since it's the starting point
    cost[0][0] = mat[0][0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to the second row
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = mat[1][j] + mat[0][0]

    # Calculate the minimum cost for each cell starting from the third row
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Find the minimum cost to reach the previous row excluding the direct column
            min_prev_row = min(cost[i - 1][k] for k in range(n) if k != j)
            # Update the cost of the current cell
            cost[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min_prev_row

    # To calculate the cost for the bottom-right corner, first find the minimum cost to get
    # to any cell in the last row from a cell in the second to last row (excluding the last column)
    # Then add the value of the bottom-right corner cell
    last_row_costs = [cost[m - 2][j] + mat[m - 1][j] for j in range(n - 1)]
    second_to_last_min = min(last_row_costs)
    bottom_right_corner_cost = mat[m - 1][-1]
    
    # The minimum path cost will be the sum of the minimum cost to get to the last row
    # plus the cost to move to the bottom-right corner
    total_min_cost = second_to_last_min + bottom_right_corner_cost

    # Now find the position where we have this second to last minimal cost
    pos = last_row_costs.index(second_to_last_min)

    # And add the cost of moving to that position from its left neighbor in the second to last row
    total_min_cost += mat[m - 1][pos] if pos > 0 else mat[m - 1][pos + 1]

    return total_min_cost

# Read data from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Write the result to 'lacusta.out'

Upon reviewing the implementation, I see the bug comes from not considering the correct set of moves during the last horizontal jumps. The correct approach should also include the minimal cost of a horizontal jump on the second-to-last row (excluding the last column and the column corresponding to the position that was used to get to the second-to-last row).

Let's fix the implementation by correctly handling the last set of jumps and provide the correct solution:

```python
# Function to find the minimum path cost
def find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat):
    # Initialize a matrix to store the minimum cost at each cell
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The first cell cost is its value since it's the starting point
    cost[0][0] = mat[0][0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost for the first move to the second row
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = mat[1][j] + mat[0][0]

    # Calculate minimum cost for each cell starting from the third row
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Find the minimum cost to reach the (i-1)th row excluding the current column
            min_prev_row = min(cost[i-1][k] + mat[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j)
            # Update the cost of the current cell
            cost[i][j] = min_prev_row

    # The last move must be handled differently. We cannot end the path on the last column of the second-to-last row.
    # We must account for two horizontal jumps: one on the second-to-last row and one on the last row.
    # We find the minimum cost of reaching any cell in the second-to-last row excluding the last cell.
    min_cost_second_last_row = min(cost[m-2][j] for j in range(n-1))

    # Then, we find the minimum cost among the possible horizontal jumps we can make on the last row.
    # We need to consider the cost of landing on any cell in the last row (excluding the last cell) from the second-to-last row
    # plus the cost of jumping from that cell to the last cell of the matrix.
    min_cost_last_row = min(cost[m-2][j] + mat[m-1][k] for j in range(n-1) for k in range(n) if k != j)

    # The total minimum cost is the sum of the two costs found above
    total_min_cost = min_cost_second_last_row + min_cost_last_row

    return total_min_cost

# Read data from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Find the minimum path cost
min_path_cost = find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat)

# Write the result to 'lacusta.out'
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_path_cost))
```

This solution implements the correct understanding of the problem's constraints and should now produce the expected output.

It seems there was a misunderstanding about the rules for the last moves. The rules state that the last move only consists of a horizontal jump to the last cell of the matrix, without a vertical move. The calculations need to be done in two parts: first, we consider all horizontal jumps except the last one, and then we consider the final jump separately.

Here is the fixed implementation that adheres to the problem's rules:

```python
# Function to find the minimum path cost
def find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat):
    # Initialize a matrix to store the minimum cost at each cell
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # The first cell cost is its value since it's the starting point
    cost[0][0] = mat[0][0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost for the first move to the second row
    for j in range(n):
        if j != 0: # We can't jump to the starting cell
            cost[1][j] = mat[1][j] + mat[0][0]

    # Calculate minimum cost for each cell starting from the third row
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Find the minimum cost to reach the (i-1)th row excluding the current column
            cost[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min(cost[i-1][:j] + cost[i-1][j+1:])

    # The last move must be handled differently: we need the minimum horizontal jump on the last row
    # that lands anywhere except the last cell, plus the value of the last cell.
    # We also need to add the minimum cost to reach the second-to-last row, excluding the column
    # of the chosen landing cell on the last row.
    min_cost = float('inf')

    # Calculate minimum cost for the last move
    for j in range(n-1):  # Loop excludes last column
        for k in range(n):  # Loop for choosing the penultimate column
            if k != j:
                min_cost = min(min_cost, cost[m-2][k] + mat[m-1][j] + mat[m-1][-1])

    return min_cost

# Read data from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Find the minimum path cost
min_path_cost = find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat)

# Write the result to 'lacusta.out'

The issue with the previous solutions is that they did not correctly account for the transition costs from each cell in the second-to-last row to the cells in the last row (except the bottom-right corner), followed by the cost of moving from those cells to the bottom-right corner. 

Let's correct the approach:

1. We will calculate the minimum cost to reach each cell in the matrix.
2. For the second-to-last row, we also need to consider the cost of moving to each cell in the last row (except the bottom-right corner) and then add the cost of moving from there to the bottom-right corner. 
3. We need to find the minimum of these costs across all cells in the second-to-last row.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the minimum path cost
def find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat):
    # Initialize a matrix to store the minimum cost at each cell
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = mat[0][0]

    # Populate the cost for the second row (only horizontal jumps are possible from the first cell)
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = mat[0][0] + mat[1][j]

    # Calculate minimum cost for each cell from the third row onwards
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # We can jump from any cell except for the one directly above
            cost[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min(cost[i-1][:j] + cost[i-1][j+1:])
            
    # For the last move, calculate the minimum cost for landing in any cell in the last row
    # except for the bottom-right corner, then add the cost of jumping to the bottom-right corner
    last_move_costs = [cost[m-2][j] + mat[m-1][j] for j in range(n-1)]
    min_last_move = min(last_move_costs)

    # Add the cost of the bottom-right corner
    min_last_move += mat[m-1][n-1]

    # Find the column index of the second-to-last row that was used to achieve the min_last_move
    col_index = last_move_costs.index(min_last_move - mat[m-1][n-1])

    # We need to add the minimum cost of a second horizontal jump on the second-to-last row,
    # excluding the column that was used to jump to the last row
    second_horizontal_jump = min(cost[m-2][:col_index] + cost[m-2][col_index+1:-1])
    min_path_cost = min_last_move + second_horizontal_jump

    return min_path_cost

# Read data from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Calculate the minimum path cost
min_path_cost = find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat)

# Write the minimum path cost to 'lacusta.out'
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_path_cost))
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the minimum path cost, considering all the rules provided, and produce the expected result.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's re-evaluate the problem and find an accurate solution.

Given a matrix with m rows and n columns, we need to traverse from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, making exactly 2m-1 moves. Since we need to move to the cell immediately below our current cell (a vertical move) and we can also move to any cell on the same row (a horizontal move), we can summarize the rules as follows:

1. The first move is a given, as we start from the top-left corner (first cell).
2. For each subsequent row until the last row, we can move to any cell in that row, then we must move down one row.
3. On the last row, we make only a horizontal move to reach the bottom-right corner.

To find the minimum cost, we need to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell, considering that the last cell visited cannot be the same as the cell we're moving to horizontally.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat):
    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # Base case: cost of the first cell
    cost[0][0] = mat[0][0]
    
    # Base case: cost of the second row (only horizontal moves)
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = cost[0][0] + mat[1][j]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost for the rest of the matrix
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # We can move horizontally to any cell except the one directly above
            for k in range(n):
                if k != j:  # We cannot move vertically
                    cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + mat[i][j])

    # Calculate the cost of the last horizontal move to the bottom-right corner
    last_row_costs = [cost[m-2][j] + mat[m-1][j] for j in range(n-1)]  # Exclude the last column
    min_cost_last_row = min(last_row_costs)

    # Add the cost of the bottom-right corner cell
    total_min_cost = min_cost_last_row + mat[m-1][n-1]

    return total_min_cost

# Read data from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Calculate the minimum path cost
min_path_cost = find_min_path_cost(m, n, mat)

# Write the minimum path cost to 'lacusta.out'
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_path_cost))
```

This solution should now align with the problem's requirements and produce the expected output.
