Un elev în clasa a V-a, Rareş, s-a gândit să studieze mersul trenurilor ce trec prin gara din oraşul său, într-o zi. Gara are $2$ linii, numerotate cu $1$ şi $2$, pe care sosesc şi pleacă trenurile. În acea zi, în gară sosesc $T$ trenuri. Pentru fiecare tren din cele $T$, Rareş cunoaşte linia $L$ pe care va sosi, momentul sosirii, adică ora $H$ şi minutul $M$, precum şi durata de timp $S$ de staţionare (exprimată în minute). El a decis ca perioada de studiu a celor $T$ trenuri să înceapă cu momentul sosirii primului tren în gară din cele $T$ şi să se încheie odată cu momentul plecării ultimului tren din cele $T$.

Din sala de aşteptare Rareş poate vedea cele $2$ linii. Rareş are însă o problemă: atunci când un tren se află în gară pe linia $1$, el nu poate vedea trenul staţionat în acelaşi timp pe linia $2$. De exemplu, dacă un tren ajunge în gară pe linia $1$ la ora $14:21$ şi staţionează $5$ minute atunci trenul va pleca din gară la ora $14:26$. Astfel, în intervalul de timp [$14:21-14:26$], Rareş nu poate vedea ce se întâmplă pe linia $2$. Trenul de pe linia $2$ va putea fi vizibil începând cu minutul următor, adică de la $14:27$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine pentru un număr $T$ de trenuri care trec prin gară în perioada de studiu din acea zi:

* numărul maxim de trenuri $Z$ care au staţionat pe aceeaşi linie;
* numărul $X$ de trenuri pe care Rareş le vede;
* durata de timp maximă $Y$ (exprimată în număr de minute consecutive), din perioada de studiu, în care Rareş nu a văzut niciun tren.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `tren.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $T$ de trenuri şi pe fiecare din următoarele $T$ linii, în ordinea sosirii trenurilor în gară, câte patru numere naturale $L$, $H$, $M$ şi $S$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, ce reprezintă linia $L$ pe care soseşte trenul, momentul sosirii trenului (ora $H$ şi minutul $M$) şi durata de timp $S$ de staţionare.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `tren.out` conţine pe prima linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu, valorile cerute $Z$, $X$ și $Y$ (în această ordine).

# Restricții și precizări


* $2 \leq T \leq 100$; $0 \leq H \leq 23$; $0 \leq M \leq 59$; $1 \leq S \leq 9$;
* în acelaşi moment de timp nu pot pleca/sosi mai multe trenuri;
* în acelaşi moment de timp nu poate pleca un tren şi altul să sosească;
* pe aceeaşi linie nu pot staţiona mai multe trenuri în acelaşi moment de timp;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $Z$ se acordă 20% din punctajul pe test;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $X$ se acordă 40% din punctajul pe test;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $Y$ se acordă 40% din punctajul pe test.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The logic for checking visibility is incorrect. We need to check if the other line is visible when a train arrives. If the other line is occupied by a train that has not left yet, we cannot see the train on the other line.
2. The count of visible trains needs to be updated correctly based on the visibility check.
3. The calculation of the maximum consecutive time when no trains are visible is incorrect.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('tren.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline())
    trains = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(T)]

# Initialize variables
line_counts = [0, 0]  # Count of trains for each line
visible_trains = 0
max_invisible_time = 0
visibility = [False, False]  # Visibility for each line
last_departure = -1

# Sort the trains by arrival time
trains.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[2]))  # Sort by hour and minute

# Process each train
for L, H, M, S in trains:
    # Convert time to minutes
    arrival_time = H * 60 + M
    departure_time = arrival_time + S

    # Check if the train on the other line is visible at the arrival time
    if not visibility[L % 2]:  # Using L % 2 to get the other line (0 or 1)
        visible_trains += 1  # This train is visible

    # Update visibility status for each line
    visibility[L-1] = False  # Current line is now blocked by the arrived train
    visibility[L % 2] = (departure_time <= arrival_time)  # Check if other line is free

    # Update line train count
    line_counts[L-1] += 1

    # Calculate consecutive time when no trains are visible
    if last_departure >= 0 and arrival_time > last_departure:
        invisible_time = arrival_time - last_departure
        if invisible_time > max_invisible_time:
            max_invisible_time = invisible_time

    # Update the last departure time
    last_departure = max(last_departure, departure_time)

# The maximum number of trains that have stationed on the same line
Z = max(line_counts)

# Write results to file
with open('tren.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{Z} {visible_trains} {max_invisible_time}\n')
```

This solution reads from 'tren.in', processes the input considering visibility and correct time intervals, and writes the corrected values of Z (max trains on the same line), visible_trains (total visible trains), and max_invisible_time (longest consecutive time with no visible trains) to 'tren.out'.

The previous correction still has an issue with calculating the `max_invisible_time`, the count of visible trains, and visibility status for each line. The logic for calculating the maximum time of invisibility should account for periods when Rareş cannot see either line, which happens when the visibility of both lines is blocked.

Here's the updated solution with the necessary corrections:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('tren.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline())
    trains = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(T)]

# Initialize variables
line_counts = [0, 0]  # Count of trains for each line
visible_trains = 0
max_invisible_time = 0
visibility = [True, True]  # Visibility for each line, initially True
last_departure = [0, 0]  # Last departure time for each line

# Process each train
for L, H, M, S in trains:
    # Convert time to minutes
    arrival_time = H * 60 + M
    departure_time = arrival_time + S
    L_index = L - 1

    # Update line train count
    line_counts[L_index] += 1

    # Check if the train is visible
    if visibility[L_index]:
        visible_trains += 1
        # Update visibility for this and the other line
        visibility[L_index] = False
        visibility[1 - L_index] = departure_time <= last_departure[1 - L_index]

    # Calculate consecutive time when no trains are visible
    if not visibility[0] and not visibility[1]:
        # Both lines are not visible, update invisible time
        invisible_start = max(last_departure[0], last_departure[1])
        if arrival_time > invisible_start:
            max_invisible_time = max(max_invisible_time, arrival_time - invisible_start)

    # Update the last departure time for the line
    last_departure[L_index] = departure_time

# After processing all trains, check if there's any remaining invisible time
end_of_study_period = max(last_departure)
invisible_time_at_end = end_of_study_period - min(last_departure)
if invisible_time_at_end > max_invisible_time:
    max_invisible_time = invisible_time_at_end

# The maximum number of trains that have stationed on the same line
Z = max(line_counts)

# Write results to file
with open('tren.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{Z} {visible_trains} {max_invisible_time}\n')
```

This updated solution tracks the visibility of each line properly, correctly counts the visible trains, and accurately calculates the maximum consecutive time when no trains are visible. It writes the corrected values to 'tren.out'.

The previous attempts to solve the problem had logical errors in calculating the maximum consecutive invisible time and the count of visible trains. The maximum invisible time should be calculated by checking periods when both lines are simultaneously blocked. The count of visible trains is only incremented if the other line is visible at the moment a train arrives.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('tren.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline())
    trains = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(T)]

# Sort trains by arrival time
trains.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] * 60 + x[2]))  # Sort by hour and minute

# Initialize variables
line_status = {1: [], 2: []}  # Departure times for trains on each line
Z = X = Y = 0  # Max trains on same line, visible trains, max invisible duration
last_seen = None  # Last minute a train was seen

# Process each train
for L, H, M, S in trains:
    # Convert arrival time to minutes
    arrival_time = H * 60 + M

    # Update visible train count
    can_see_other_line = not line_status[3 - L] or line_status[3 - L][-1] <= arrival_time
    if can_see_other_line:
        X += 1

    # Update the status of the line with the current train's departure time
    departure_time = arrival_time + S
    line_status[L].append(departure_time)
    
    # Update maximum trains on the same line count
    Z = max(Z, len(line_status[L]))

    # Calculate maximum invisible duration
    if last_seen is not None and can_see_other_line:
        Y = max(Y, arrival_time - last_seen)
    if can_see_other_line or not line_status[1] or not line_status[2]:
        last_seen = departure_time

# Handle the case where the last train of the day leaves and no more trains are seen
final_departure = max(line_status[1][-1], line_status[2][-1])
if last_seen is not None:
    Y = max(Y, final_departure - last_seen)

# Write results to file
with open('tren.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{Z} {X} {Y}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly compute the number of visible trains, the longest consecutive time with no visible trains, and the maximum number of trains stationed on the same line. The values are then written to 'tren.out'.

The previous solution failed to consider that visibility could only change when a train departs, not when it arrives. Also, the logic for calculating the maximum invisible time was incorrect. Let's correct these issues.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('tren.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline())
    events = []
    for _ in range(T):
        L, H, M, S = map(int, file.readline().split())
        arrival_time = H * 60 + M
        departure_time = arrival_time + S
        # Events are (time, event type, line), event type: 1 for arrival, -1 for departure
        events.append((arrival_time, 1, L))
        events.append((departure_time, -1, L))

# Sort events by time, then by event type (departures before arrivals)
events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

# Initialize variables
Z = X = Y = 0
in_station = [0, 0]  # Trains in station for both lines
last_time = events[0][0]  # Last event time
max_trains_on_line = 0  # Max trains on a single line

for time, event_type, L in events:
    L -= 1  # Convert line number to index (0 or 1)
    if event_type == 1:  # Train arrival
        in_station[L] += 1
        max_trains_on_line = max(max_trains_on_line, in_station[L])
        # If both lines are occupied, Rareş can't see the train
        if in_station[1 - L] == 0:
            X += 1  # Rareş can see this train
        
    else:  # Train departure
        in_station[L] -= 1
        # Calculate the invisible time if Rareş couldn't see any train
        if in_station[0] == 0 and in_station[1] == 0:
            Y = max(Y, time - last_time)
        last_time = time

# The maximum number of trains that have stationed on the same line
Z = max_trains_on_line

# Write results to file
with open('tren.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{Z} {X} {Y}\n')
```

This solution processes events sorted by time, which include both arrivals and departures. It updates the number of trains in the station for each line and calculates the number of visible trains. It tracks the maximum number of trains on a single line and calculates the maximum invisible time correctly. It then writes the results to 'tren.out'.

The previous solution incorrectly calculated the maximum number of trains on a single line (Z), and the maximum invisible time (Y) was not correctly handled. We need to keep track of the moments in time when Rareș cannot see any train due to a train being on line 1, and update Y accordingly.

Let's reimplement the solution with an accurate algorithm that considers these factors.

```python
# Read data from file
with open('tren.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline())
    trains = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(T)]

# Convert train data into events and sort by time
events = []
for L, H, M, S in trains:
    arrival = H * 60 + M
    departure = arrival + S
    events.append((arrival, 'arrival', L))
    events.append((departure, 'departure', L))
events.sort()

# Initialize variables
line_occupation = {1: 0, 2: 0}
last_departure = {1: -1, 2: -1}
max_trains_on_line = Z = X = Y = 0
last_time_train_seen = None

# Process events
for time, event_type, L in events:
    if event_type == 'arrival':
        # Increase occupation of the line
        line_occupation[L] += 1
        # Check if this train is visible (previous train on the other line has departed)
        if last_departure[3 - L] < time:
            X += 1
            last_time_train_seen = time  # Update last time a train was seen
        # Update max trains on a single line
        Z = max(Z, line_occupation[L])
    else:  # 'departure'
        # Decrease occupation of the line
        line_occupation[L] -= 1
        # Update last departure for the line
        last_departure[L] = time
        # If both lines are free, update the maximum invisible time
        if line_occupation[1] == 0 and line_occupation[2] == 0:
            if last_time_train_seen is not None:
                Y = max(Y, time - last_time_train_seen)
            last_time_train_seen = time  # Reset last time a train was seen

# Write results to file
with open('tren.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{Z} {X} {Y}\n')
```

This solution properly counts the number of trains on a single line (Z), visible trains (X), and the maximum consecutive minutes not seeing any trains (Y) by tracking train arrivals and departures as events in chronological order. The results are then correctly written to 'tren.out'.

There seems to be a misunderstanding in the way the previous solutions attempted to solve the problem. The main issue lies in tracking the visibility of trains, counting the maximum number of trains on a line, and calculating the maximum invisible time. Let's re-implement the solution, incorporating a correct approach.

```python
# Read data from file
with open('tren.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline())
    trains = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(T)]

# Sort trains by arrival time
trains.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[2]))  # Sort by hour and minute

# Initialize variables
trains_on_line = [0, 0]  # Trains currently on line 1 and 2
Z = X = last_time_seen = 0
invisibility_start = None

# Process each train
for i, (L, H, M, S) in enumerate(trains):
    arrival_time = H * 60 + M
    departure_time = arrival_time + S

    # Update Z (max trains on the same line)
    trains_on_line[L - 1] += 1
    Z = max(Z, trains_on_line[L - 1])

    # Update X (visible trains)
    # A train is visible if there is no train on the other line at the time of its arrival
    other_line = 0 if L == 2 else 1
    if i == 0 or (trains[i - 1][0] != 3 - L and arrival_time > trains[i - 1][1] * 60 + trains[i - 1][2] + trains[i - 1][3]):
        X += 1
        last_time_seen = departure_time
        if invisibility_start is not None:
            Y = max(Y, arrival_time - invisibility_start)
            invisibility_start = None
    else:
        if invisibility_start is None:
            invisibility_start = last_time_seen

    # Update the departure time for trains on the same line
    trains[i] = (L, H, M, departure_time)

# Check for last invisibility period until the end of the study period
if invisibility_start is not None:
    Y = max(Y, trains[-1][3] - invisibility_start)

# Write results to file
with open('tren.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{Z} {X} {Y}\n')
```

This solution first sorts the trains by arrival time. It then goes through each train in order, updating the count of trains on each line and checking if the train is visible based on the other line's status. It also keeps track of the last time Rareș saw a train and updates the maximum invisible time accordingly. Finally, it writes the computed `Z`, `X`, and `Y` values to the `tren.out` file.
