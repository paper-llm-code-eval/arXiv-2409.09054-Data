Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.

            operations.append((i + 1, left + 1))
            buckets[left] += buckets[i]
            buckets[i] = 0

    # No valid pouring found
    return False

# Prepare an array to represent the buckets
buckets = [1] * n

# Find the operations to achieve the target effort
if not pour_water(buckets, e, operations, 0, n - 1):

This is a Python solution to the problem. It reads the input from `galeti.in`, then it attempts to recursively find a series of pouring operations that result in the desired total effort `e`. If it finds a solution, it writes it to `galeti.out`; if no solution is found, it writes "No solution found". The solution uses a recursive approach to find the sequence of pouring operations and avoids using `input()` and `print()` as required by the problem statement.

The recursive approach I initially provided appears to be incorrect in finding a valid sequence of pouring operations that result in the desired total effort `e`. The base cases and the recursive strategy do not properly account for the constraints of the problem, that is, ensuring that only non-empty buckets to the right of empty buckets are poured into the first non-empty bucket to their left.

Given that the recursive depth could be very large for big inputs and might lead to stack overflow or performance issues, it would be more appropriate to find a non-recursive solution.

The problem can be solved by observing that the total effort `e` needs to be broken down into powers of 2, since each bucket starts with 1 liter, and each pouring operation doubles the amount of water in some bucket. We can represent `e` in binary, and that will give us the sequence of pourings to make, with each bit corresponding to a bucket (except the last bit, which will always be 1).

Here is an alternative solution that uses this observation:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, e = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize the result list
operations = []

# Convert the effort to binary, skipping the least significant bit (always 1)
effort_binary = bin(e)[3:]

# Initialize the list of buckets with 1 liter in each
buckets = [1] * n

# Perform the operations
current_bucket = 1  # We start pouring into the second bucket
for bit in effort_binary:
    if bit == '1':
        # Pour from the current bucket into the first bucket
        operations.append((current_bucket + 1, 1))
        buckets[0] += buckets[current_bucket]
        buckets[current_bucket] = 0
    # Regardless of whether we poured or not, double the current bucket
    current_bucket += 1
    operations.append((current_bucket, current_bucket - 1))
    buckets[current_bucket - 1] += buckets[current_bucket - 1]

# Write the operations to the output file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
    for op in operations:
        fout.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
```

This code reads the number of buckets and the desired effort from the `galeti.in` file, then computes the required pour operations, and writes them to the `galeti.out` file. It assumes the existence of a valid solution and does not include error handling if no solution exists, as the problem guarantees at least one solution is possible. The approach is based on converting the effort to its binary representation and using the bits to determine which buckets to pour into the first bucket.

The output of the provided code does not match the expected output. The reason for this is that the approach does not correctly implement the rule stating that we can only pour water from a bucket to another if all the buckets between them are empty. The binary representation idea is creative, but it does not directly apply to this problem.

We need to rethink the strategy. To achieve a certain effort exactly, we need to consider that every pouring action we take will contribute to the total effort. We can use a greedy strategy, where we first pour all the water from the last bucket into the second last bucket, and so forth, until we reach the first bucket. This way, the amount of water doubles in the buckets we are pouring into. We continue doing this until the sum of the efforts made by pouring equals `e`.

Let's try implementing this:

```python
def write_output(operations):
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
        for op in operations:
            fout.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")

# Read input data from file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, e = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
operations = []
current_effort = 0
buckets = [1] * n

# While we haven't reached the effort and there are buckets to pour
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    while current_effort + buckets[i] <= e and buckets[i] > 0:
        # Pour from the ith bucket to the (i-1)th bucket
        operations.append((i + 1, i))
        buckets[i - 1] += buckets[i]
        current_effort += buckets[i]
        buckets[i] = 0

# Check if the last operation can be performed to reach the exact effort
if current_effort < e and buckets[1] > 0:
    operations.append((2, 1))
    current_effort += buckets[1]
    buckets[0] += buckets[1]
    buckets[1] = 0

# Verify if we have reached the required effort
if current_effort == e:
    write_output(operations)
else:
    # If we cannot reach the exact effort, write an error message
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write("No solution found\n")
```

The revised solution carefully pours water from the rightmost non-empty bucket to its immediate left neighbor, only if doing so does not exceed the total effort `e`. Once all possible water has been poured in this way, it checks if a final pour from the second to the first bucket can achieve the exact effort required. If the algorithm reaches the exact effort, it outputs the sequence of operations; otherwise, it reports that no solution could be found.

The previous iterative solution does not successfully find the correct sequence of operations because it does not ensure that each pour only happens between buckets where the intermediate buckets are empty. Additionally, it is not correctly constructing the sequence of operations that lead to the exact effort `e`.

To address this, we can use a different strategy. We can start by considering the most significant bit (MSB) of the effort `e` in its binary representation (excluding the least significant bit, as it will be 1 by default because we always have to pour the last bucket into the first one). Each bit in `e` from MSB to LSB represents a doubling of the water if it's a 1. We start with the MSB and set up our buckets so that by pouring from the bucket corresponding to the current bit to the first bucket, we get that part of the effort. After setting up all buckets according to the bits in `e`, we do the pours.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, e = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize the result list and buckets list
operations = []
buckets = [1] * n  # Start with 1 liter in each bucket

# Find the highest power of 2 in e (minus the last bit)
effort = e - 1  # Subtract 1 because the last bucket will always pour into the first
highest_power = 1
while (1 << (highest_power + 1)) <= effort:
    highest_power += 1

# Place the water in the correct buckets according to the binary representation of e
for i in range(highest_power, -1, -1):
    if (1 << i) & effort:  # If the bit is 1 in the effort
        # Determine the source bucket based on the current power of 2
        source_bucket = highest_power - i + 1
        # Pour all intermediate buckets into the source bucket to double its water
        for j in range(source_bucket, highest_power + 1):
            operations.append((j + 1, source_bucket))
            buckets[source_bucket - 1] += buckets[source_bucket - 1]
            
        # Pour the source bucket into the first bucket
        operations.append((source_bucket + 1, 1))
        buckets[0] += buckets[source_bucket]
        buckets[source_bucket] = 0

# Fill in the remaining operations by pouring the water back to the first bucket
for i in range(2, highest_power + 2):
    if buckets[i - 1] != 0:
        operations.append((i, 1))
        buckets[0] += buckets[i - 1]
        buckets[i - 1] = 0

# Write the operations to the output file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
    for op in operations:
        fout.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
```

This solution breaks down the effort `e` into contributions from each bucket, as indicated by the binary representation of `e`, and arranges a sequence of pouring operations accordingly. It assumes there is a solution (as guaranteed by the problem statement) and writes the sequence of operations to `galeti.out`.

The output of the revised algorithm still does not match the expected output due to incorrect bucket selection for pouring operations. The algorithm incorrectly assumes that it can always double the water by pouring adjacent buckets into each other, but this is not always the case.

To solve this problem correctly, we must follow the rules for pouring and consider the restrictions that buckets in between must be empty. We need to use an algorithm that can handle this.

Let's try a different approach where we work backward from the total effort `e`:

1. We start by filling the last bucket with enough water such that pouring it into the first bucket gives us the remaining effort after subtracting the efforts from the pours that led to filling the last bucket.
2. We know that each bucket `i` can be filled by pouring from bucket `i+1`, doubling the content of bucket `i`. We do this until we cannot double anymore (when the effort becomes smaller than the next doubling).
3. When we can no longer double, we move to the next bucket and repeat the process.

The following steps implement this idea:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, e = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
operations = []
remaining_effort = e
buckets = [1] * n  # All buckets start with 1 liter

# Start from the last bucket and move backwards
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    # Calculate the water needed in bucket i to contribute to the effort
    while remaining_effort - buckets[i] >= 2**(i - 1):
        # Pour water from the next bucket to double the content
        operations.append((i + 1, i))
        remaining_effort -= buckets[i]
        buckets[i - 1] += buckets[i]
        buckets[i] *= 2

# Write the operations to the output file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
    for op in reversed(operations):  # Reverse the operations to correct order
        fout.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
```

This solution starts at the last bucket and works backward, doubling the contents of each bucket until it can no longer do so without exceeding the remaining effort. It records each operation and then writes them in reverse order, as they were recorded in reverse. This should conform to the restrictions that only non-empty buckets to the right of empty buckets are poured and that the effort for pouring from bucket `i` to `j` is exactly `a_i`.

The revised solution still fails to produce the expected output. The operations performed do not correctly follow the rules of the problem, specifically the rule that ensures we can only pour from a bucket to another non-empty bucket if all the buckets in between are empty.

The correct strategy for this problem is to consider the sequence of pours needed to concentrate all water into the first bucket with a total effort of `e`. We can start with the rightmost bucket, pour its water into the closest left bucket that is not empty, and repeat this process until the first bucket has all the water. We must choose which buckets to pour from and to in a way that the total effort adds up to `e`.

Here's an algorithm that accomplishes this:

1. Start from the rightmost bucket `n` and attempt to pour it into the first non-empty bucket to its left.
2. Calculate the effort of pouring each bucket into the first bucket on the left.
3. Keep track of the total effort. If at any point the calculated effort would exceed `e`, skip to the next non-empty bucket on the left.
4. Repeat this process until all water is in the first bucket and the total effort equals `e`.

Let's try implementing this solution:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, e = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
operations = []
total_effort = 0
buckets = [1] * n  # All buckets start with 1 liter

# Go through the buckets from right to left
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # Calculate the effort to pour the current bucket into the bucket to its left
    while i > 1 and total_effort + buckets[i - 1] <= e:
        # Pour the current bucket into the previous non-empty bucket on the left
        operations.append((i, i - 1))
        total_effort += buckets[i - 1]
        buckets[i - 2] += buckets[i - 1]
        buckets[i - 1] = 0
        i -= 1  # Move to the next bucket on the left

# Check if the total effort matches the desired effort
if total_effort != e:
    # If there is no solution, write an error message
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write("No solution found\n")
else:
    # If a solution is found, write the operations to the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
        for op in operations:
            fout.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
```

This solution should correctly pour water from right to left according to the rules, keeping track of the total effort and ensuring it matches `e` exactly. The operations are written to the output file in the order they are performed.

The previous implementations failed to find the correct sequence of pouring operations. The problem lies in not correctly considering the rules for pouring while also achieving the exact effort `e`. To address this, we need to implement a solution that tries to fill the găleți (buckets) in such a way that we can reach the exact amount of effort `e` by pouring the water back to the first bucket.

Let's implement an algorithm that systematically fills the buckets by pouring from right to left, and then pours back to the first bucket, ensuring that the efforts add up to `e`, and that we only pour from a bucket if the buckets in between are empty.

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, e = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Initialize operations array and the effort array
operations = []
buckets_effort = [1] * n  # buckets_effort[i] will store the effort to pour bucket i+1 into bucket 1

# Calculate the effort to pour each bucket into the first one directly
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    buckets_effort[i - 1] = buckets_effort[i - 2] * 2

# Start from the last bucket and try to pour water into the first bucket
# while keeping track of the used effort
used_effort = 0
for i in range(n, 1, -1):
    # Check if pouring from the current bucket to the first bucket is possible
    pour_effort = buckets_effort[i - 1]
    if used_effort + pour_effort <= e:
        operations.append((i, 1))
        used_effort += pour_effort

# Now we need to do the intermediate pours to actually achieve the state
# represented by the operations array
for i in range(len(operations) - 1, 0, -1):
    from_bucket = operations[i][0]
    # Pour each intermediate bucket to the next non-empty bucket to the left
    for j in range(from_bucket - 1, 1, -1):
        operations.append((j, j - 1))

# After performing intermediate operations, pour remaining water to the first bucket
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    if used_effort + 1 <= e:
        operations.append((i, 1))
        used_effort += 1

# Check if we have achieved the exact effort
if used_effort == e:
    # Write the operations to the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
        for op in operations:
            fout.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
else:
    # If the exact effort cannot be achieved, write an error message
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write("No solution\n")
```

This solution first calculates the efforts to pour from each bucket directly to the first bucket. It then selects buckets to pour based on whether their pouring effort can be part of the total effort `e`. After deciding which buckets can be poured directly into the first bucket, it then performs the necessary intermediate pours. If the used effort equals the desired effort `e`, it writes the operations to the output file. If not, it reports no solution.
