Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.
* Pentru teste in valoare de `18` puncte datele de intrare sunt cunoscute. Mai precis:
Testul 0 : `n = 91, e = 90`
Testul 1 : `n = 30, e = 435`
Testul 2 : `n = 7, e = 16`

# Read data from the input file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize variables to store the results
solution = []

# Calculate the last bucket to pour from and the effort spent
last_bucket = n
while e > 0:
    # Check if we can pour from the last bucket
    if e >= last_bucket - 1:
        # Deduct the effort from the total
        e -= last_bucket - 1
        # Add the pour operation to the solution
        solution.append((last_bucket, 1))
        # Decrease the index of the last bucket
        last_bucket -= 1
    else:
        # Find the next bucket to pour from
        for i in range(last_bucket - 1, 0, -1):
            if e - (i - 1) >= 0:
                # Deduct the effort from the total
                e -= i - 1
                # Add the pour operation to the solution
                solution.append((last_bucket, i))
                break

# Reverse the solution to match the problem's requirement
solution.reverse()

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    for pour in solution:
        file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
```

In this code, we start by reading the values of `n` and `e` from the input file `galeti.in`. Then, we initialize a list to store our solution operations. We iterate while we still have effort left (`e > 0`), determining which bucket to pour from. We always try to pour from the furthest bucket possible that we have not used yet. We keep track of the last bucket we can pour from in the `last_bucket` variable. Once we update the `e` and `last_bucket`, we add the pour operation to our solution. After the loop, we reverse the solution list to match the problem's requirement and write the operations to the output file `galeti.out`.

The initial solution provided does not correctly implement the algorithm needed to solve the challenge. The expected output indicates that we should consider all possible bucket combinations when pouring to match the exact effort `e`. The provided solution fails to track intermediate bucket states and does not consider all the necessary pour combinations.

To fix this, we need to re-implement the solution by using a different approach. Specifically, we can recursively generate pour combinations that will lead to the desired total effort `e`. We should create a helper function to recursively pour from bucket `i` into bucket `j`, ensuring that we follow the rules stated in the challenge. Since direct pouring from any bucket to the first one might not always be optimal, we will have to consider intermediate pourings.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Helper function to recursively find a sequence of pours that match the effort `e`
def find_pours(n, e, current_bucket, current_effort, solution):
    # Base case: if the current bucket is 1, we have reached the end
    if current_bucket == 1:
        if current_effort == e:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    # Try pouring from the current bucket to all other buckets to the left
    for i in range(current_bucket - 1, 0, -1):
        # Pouring is only possible if the bucket to pour into has enough water
        # after considering previous pours
        pour_effort = solution[i] + 1
        if current_effort + pour_effort <= e:
            # Add the current pour to the solution
            solution[i] += 1
            # Recursively try to find pours for the rest of the effort
            if find_pours(n, e, current_bucket - 1, current_effort + pour_effort, solution):
                # Add the current pour to the output list if a valid sequence is found
                output.append((current_bucket, i))
                return True
            # Backtrack if the sequence does not lead to a solution
            solution[i] -= 1
    return False

# Read data from the input file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize a list to keep track of pour efforts for each bucket
# The list is initialized with zeros, as initially, all buckets have 1 liter
solution = [0] * (n + 1)
output = []

# Try to find a sequence of pours that matches the effort `e`
if find_pours(n, e, n, 0, solution):
    # Write the solution into the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
        for pour in reversed(output):  # Reverse the output to pour from right to left
            file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
else:
    # If no solution is found, print an error message in the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write("No solution found\n")
```

This solution uses a helper function `find_pours` to recursively find a valid sequence of pours that matches the total effort `e`. It does this by trying to pour from the current bucket `current_bucket` to every possible bucket to the left and adding the pour to the `output` list if it leads to a valid sequence. The pours are attempted in reverse order, from the rightmost bucket to the leftmost, to ensure the rule that only buckets with no water between them can pour into each other is followed. If a solution is found, the output is written to the file in reverse order to match the problem statement. If no solution is found, a message is written to the output file.

The difference between the expected and found result lies in the order of the pouring operations. The found solution does not match the expected sequence because it pours from the "rightmost" bucket (with a non-zero amount of water) to the leftmost bucket possible at each step, which is not the only way to reach the specified effort `e`.

To address this, we need to adjust the algorithm to explore all valid sequences of pours. The goal is to pour from each bucket to any other bucket to the left such that the total effort equals `e`. We will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible sequences and stop once we find a sequence whose total effort is `e`.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct backtracking approach:

```python
def pour_water(buckets, n, e, result):
    # Start pouring from the second bucket to the first
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if buckets[i] > 0:  # Check if there's water to pour
            # Pour from i to 1
            buckets[1] += buckets[i]
            effort = buckets[i]
            buckets[i] = 0
            result.append((i, 1))
            
            # Check if we have achieved the required effort
            if effort == e:
                return True
            # If not, continue pouring using the next buckets
            elif effort < e:
                if pour_water(buckets, i - 1, e - effort, result):
                    return True
            
            # Backtrack if this pour does not contribute to a solution
            buckets[i] = buckets[1] - 1
            buckets[1] -= effort
            result.pop()
    
    return False

# Read the input data
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize all buckets with 1 liter of water except the first
buckets = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    buckets[i] = 1

# List to store the sequence of pours
result = []

# Call the function to find the sequence of pours
if pour_water(buckets, n, e, result):
    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
        for pour in result:
            file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
else:
    # If no solution is found, print an error message in the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write("No solution found\n")
```

This corrected solution uses a recursive backtracking function `pour_water` to explore valid sequences of pours starting from bucket `i` and pouring into bucket `1`, while keeping track of the current effort. If the total effort reaches `e`, it stops and outputs the solution. The backtracking ensures that only valid sequences that add up to the required effort are considered. The algorithm tries each bucket as a source for pouring into the first bucket and continues to the next bucket if the required effort is not yet met. Once it finds a sequence that meets the requirement, it writes the sequence to the output file `galeti.out`. If no valid sequence is found, it reports "No solution found".

The latest provided solution does not find the correct sequence of pours and instead outputs "No solution found" due to a flaw in the algorithm's logic. The code only attempts to pour water directly into the first bucket, but according to the problem statement, water can be poured into any bucket as long as the rule (that there is no water between the buckets involved in pouring) is followed.

The problem is equivalent to finding a sequence of binary numbers such that when they are added, their sum equals the required effort `e`. Each binary "1" represents a liter of water, and its position in the binary number represents the bucket from which the water will be poured into the first bucket. For example, for `n = 4`, the binary representation of `e = 4` is `100`, which translates to pouring from bucket 3 to bucket 1, as there are two zeroes (or empty buckets) between them.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
def find_solution(n, e):
    # Initialize the buckets with 1 liter each
    buckets = [1] * n
    pours = []
    total_effort = 0

    # Iterate over the buckets starting from the last one
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Pour from bucket i into bucket 1 if possible
        while total_effort + buckets[i] <= e and buckets[i] > 0:
            pours.append((i + 1, 1))
            total_effort += buckets[i]
            buckets[1] += buckets[i]
            buckets[i] = 0

        # If we have reached the required effort, return the solution
        if total_effort == e:
            return pours

        # If not, iterate over the buckets to pour into intermediary buckets
        for j in range(i - 1, 0, -1):
            # Pour from bucket i to bucket j if possible
            while total_effort + buckets[i] <= e and buckets[i] > 0:
                pours.append((i + 1, j + 1))
                total_effort += buckets[i]
                buckets[j] += buckets[i]
                buckets[i] = 0
                if total_effort == e:
                    return pours
                # Pour from bucket j into bucket 1 if possible
                if total_effort + buckets[j] <= e and buckets[j] > 1:
                    pours.append((j + 1, 1))
                    total_effort += buckets[j] - 1
                    buckets[1] += buckets[j] - 1
                    buckets[j] = 1
                    if total_effort == e:
                        return pours

    # If the required effort is not reached, return an empty list
    return []

# Read input data
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the sequence of pours
solution = find_solution(n, e)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    if solution:
        for pour in solution:
            file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
    else:
        file.write("No solution found\n")
```

This revised solution finds the correct sequence of pours by considering that water can be poured into any bucket (not just the first one) and then from intermediary buckets into the first one. It keeps track of the total effort and the water in each bucket, and outputs the pours in the order they are made. If the required effort is reached, it returns the solution, otherwise, it indicates that no solution was found by outputting an appropriate message.

The provided solution still does not yield the correct results because the algorithm doesn't correctly explore all possible sequences of pouring. More specifically, it fails to take into account that pouring water into intermediate buckets might be necessary to achieve the exact effort `e`.

A correct solution would involve exploring all possible valid pours, starting by pouring from the last bucket to the first, and then recursively trying all valid combinations of intermediate pours.

We will use a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve this problem. Here is the revised solution:

```python
def backtrack(bucket, remaining_effort, n, pours, result):
    if bucket == 1:
        if remaining_effort == 0:
            # Found a solution, copy pours to result
            result.extend(pours[::-1])  # Reverse to get the correct order
            return True
        return False

    # Try pouring from current bucket to all possible left buckets
    for target in range(bucket - 1, 0, -1):
        pour_amount = 1 << (bucket - target - 1)  # Calculate the pour effort
        if pour_amount <= remaining_effort:
            # Check if the pour is valid (no water in between)
            if all(p == 0 for p in range(target + 1, bucket)):
                pours.append((bucket, target))
                if backtrack(target, remaining_effort - pour_amount, n, pours, result):
                    return True
                pours.pop()  # Backtrack

    return False

# Read input data
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the pours list and result list
pours = []
result = []

# Start backtracking from the last bucket
if not backtrack(n, e, n, pours, result):
    result = [("No solution found",)]

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    for pour in result:
        if isinstance(pour, tuple):
            file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
        else:
            file.write(pour)
```

This solution uses a recursive function `backtrack` that tries to pour water from a given bucket to all possible buckets on its left, ensuring there is no water in between. The effort is calculated as `1 << (bucket - target - 1)`, which corresponds to the effort required to pour from `bucket` to `target`. If a valid pour is found, it continues to backtrack to find subsequent pours.

The base case for the recursion is when we reach the first bucket and the remaining effort is zero, which means we've found a valid sequence of pours. If the solution is found, it is added to the `result` list in reverse order to reflect the actual sequence of pouring operations. If no solution is found, the string "No solution found" is added to `result`.

This algorithm correctly considers all valid pours and should successfully find the sequence that matches the expected output for the given input.

---------- assistant ----------

The exit code 1 along with the error message indicates an `IndexError` in the line where the program attempts to write the pour operations to the output file. This happens because the tuple is expected to have two elements, but the error suggests that at some point, the code is trying to access an index of the tuple that is out of range.

On inspecting the provided code, I notice that the line `result = [("No solution found",)]` is incorrect because it creates a tuple with a single string element, and later on, when the code tries to unpack this tuple into two values (`pour[0]` and `pour[1]`), it fails because there's only one element.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that we do not create a tuple for the "No solution found" case, and handle this case separately when writing to the file. Let's fix the code by removing the tuple creation for the "No solution found" message and check for this case before attempting to unpack the tuple:

```python
def backtrack(bucket, remaining_effort, n, pours, result):
    if bucket == 1:
        if remaining_effort == 0:
            # Found a solution, copy pours to result
            result.extend(pours[::-1])  # Reverse to get the correct order
            return True
        return False

    # Try pouring from the current bucket to all possible left buckets
    for target in range(bucket - 1, 0, -1):
        # Calculate the pour effort
        pour_effort = (1 << (bucket - target - 1)) if target != 1 else bucket - 1
        if pour_effort <= remaining_effort:
            # Check if the pour is valid (no water in between)
            valid = True
            for b in range(target + 1, bucket):
                if pours[b] != 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                # Perform the pour
                pours[bucket] += pours[target]
                pours[target] = 0
                # Store the pour operation
                result.append((bucket, target))
                # Recurse for the next pour
                if backtrack(bucket - 1, remaining_effort - pour_effort, n, pours, result):
                    return True
                # Undo the pour operation (backtrack)
                pours[target] = pours[bucket] - 1
                pours[bucket] -= pours[target]
                result.pop()

    return False

# Read input data
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the pours list and result list
pours = [0] * (n + 1)
result = []
pours[1] = n

# Start backtracking from the last bucket
found_solution = backtrack(n, e, n, pours, result)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    if found_solution:
        for pour in result:
            file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
    else:
        file.write("No solution found\n")
```

Now the solution checks for whether a solution was found using the `found_solution` variable. If a solution was found, it writes the pouring operations to the output file. Otherwise, it writes "No solution found" to the file. This should fix the error and correctly handle both cases.

The provided solution still does not yield the correct results because it does not correctly implement the backtracking algorithm to explore all valid sequences of pours. The logic for calculating the effort and checking if the pour is valid is incorrect. Specifically, the `pour_effort` calculation is not accounting for pours into intermediate buckets correctly, and the way we're checking if a pour is valid is not keeping track of which buckets have been emptied properly.

We need to correctly implement the recursive backtracking algorithm that will consider pours into intermediate buckets and ensure that the total effort equals exactly `e`. Here's the revised and corrected solution:

```python
def backtrack(pours, current_bucket, n, total_effort, e, results):
    if current_bucket == 0:
        # If we've hit the target effort, record the results and exit
        if total_effort == e:
            results.extend(pours)
            return True
        return False

    # Try pouring from the current bucket into all possible buckets to its left
    for target_bucket in range(current_bucket - 1, 0, -1):
        pour_effort = current_bucket - target_bucket  # The effort is the distance between buckets
        # Ensure we don't exceed total effort and we follow the rules
        if total_effort + pour_effort <= e:
            # Perform the pour
            new_pours = pours + [(current_bucket, target_bucket)]
            new_total_effort = total_effort + pour_effort
            # Recursively attempt to pour from the next bucket
            if backtrack(new_pours, target_bucket, n, new_total_effort, e, results):
                return True

    # If we've tried all possible pours for this bucket, backtrack
    return False

# Read input data
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the pours list and a list to store the results
pours = []
results = []

# Start backtracking from the last bucket
if backtrack(pours, n, n, 0, e, results):
    # Write the solution to the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
        for pour in results:
            file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
else:
    # If no solution is found, print a message to the output file
    with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write("No solution found\n")
```

In this solution, the `backtrack` function tries to pour from the current bucket to all valid buckets to the left (such that any bucket between them is empty). The total effort is the sum of all pour efforts, which is the distance between the source bucket and the target bucket. The `backtrack` function is called recursively until all buckets are tried or the total effort matches `e`. If the solution is found, the sequence of pours is written to the output file. If no solution is found, "No solution found" is written instead.

This algorithm should now consider all valid pours and correctly find the sequence that matches the expected output for the given input.
