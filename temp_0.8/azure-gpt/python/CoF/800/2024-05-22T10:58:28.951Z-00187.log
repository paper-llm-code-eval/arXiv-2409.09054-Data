Zarul folosit la diverse jocuri este un cub care are desenat pe fiecare față a sa $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ sau $6$ puncte. Pe un zar nu există două fețe cu același număr de puncte și suma punctelor de pe oricare două fețe opuse este egală cu $7$.

Pe o masă de joc este desenat un traseu în formă de pătrat, cu latura de dimensiune $n$. Fiecare latură a traseului este împărțită în $n$ pătrățele identice, care au latura egală cu cea a zarului. Zarul este așezat inițial în colțul din stânga sus al traseului și apoi rostogolit de pe o față pe alta, din pătrățel în pătrățel, de-a lungul traseului parcurs în sensul acelor de ceasornic.

În orice moment ne-am uita la zar, putem vedea numărul punctelor desenate pe trei din fețele sale (așa cum se vede în desenul de mai sus).

Notăm cu $f_1$ fața cubului orientată spre noi, $f_2$ fața superioară a cubului, respectiv cu $f_3$ fața laterală din dreapta. Pentru exemplul din figură: $n = 4$, fața dinspre noi ($f_1$) conține trei puncte, fața superioară ($f_2$) conține două puncte, fața laterală din dreapta ($f_3$) conține un punct, iar sensul de deplasare este cel precizat prin săgeți.

# Cerință

Cunoscând dimensiunea $n$ a traseului și numărul punctelor de pe cele trei fețe ale zarului în poziția inițială, determinați după $k$ rostogoliri numărul punctelor ce se pot observa pe fiecare din cele trei fețe ale zarului.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `zar.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $n$ și $k$ despărțite printr-un spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află trei numere naturale separate prin spații ce corespund numărului de puncte de pe fețele $f_1, f_2$, respectiv $f_3$ ale zarului în poziția inițială.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `zar.out` va conține o singură linie cu trei numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă numărul punctelor ce se pot observa pe fețele $f_1$, $f_2$ și $f_3$ (în această ordine) după ce au fost efectuate $k$ rostogoliri pe traseul dat.

# Restricții și precizări

I apologize for the oversight. After reviewing the original solution, it appears that there is an issue with the direction calculation and the face rotation logic. The direction calculation does not take into account the complete cycle around the square, and the face rotation logic is incorrect.

Here's the corrected Python code:
```python
# zar.py

def roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction):
    if direction == 'N':
        return f2, 7 - f1, f3
    elif direction == 'E':
        return 7 - f3, f2, f1
    elif direction == 'S':
        return 7 - f2, f1, f3
    else:  # direction == 'W'
        return f3, f2, 7 - f1

def get_direction(position, n):
    if position < n:
        return 'E'
    elif position < 2 * n - 1:
        return 'S'
    elif position < 3 * n - 2:
        return 'W'
    else:
        return 'N'

def calculate_faces_after_rolls(n, k, f1, f2, f3):
    position = k % (4 * (n - 1))
    direction = get_direction(position, n)
    
    for _ in range(position + 1):
        f1, f2, f3 = roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction)
        if _ != position:  # Change direction on corners except for the last roll
            direction = get_direction(_ + 1, n)
    
    return f1, f2, f3

# Read from zar.in
with open('zar.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Perform the calculations
result = calculate_faces_after_rolls(n, k, f1, f2, f3)

# Write to zar.out
with open('zar.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]} {result[2]}\n')
```

Explanation of differences and fix:
- The original direction calculation did not account for the modulo application to ensure that the dice position is wrapped around the square correctly. The new `get_direction` function corrects this.
- The original face rotation logic did not correctly handle the change in faces after a roll. The `roll_dice` function now correctly updates the faces according to the given direction.
- The loop has been modified to account for the actual position on the track and change directions at the corners.

Please use this corrected code to solve the challenge. Make sure to place this code in a file named 'zar.py' and provide an input file named 'zar.in' with the correct content. The output will be written to 'zar.out'.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's re-evaluate the rolling logic and correct the algorithm.

The dice have 6 faces, and when it's rolled, the top and bottom (opposite sides) always sum up to 7. If we start with faces `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, the initial opposite of `f3` (the right side) is `7 - f3`. When the dice roll, the new bottom face becomes the previous right face, the new right face is the previous top face, and the new top face is the opposite of the new bottom face.

To solve the problem, we first find the number of complete cycles the dice makes around the board. Each complete cycle brings the dice back to its original orientation, so they can be ignored for the final orientation. We then only need to consider the remaining rolls after completing the cycles.

Let's revise and simplify the code:

```python
# zar.py

def roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction):
    if direction == 'N':
        return 7 - f2, f1, f3
    elif direction == 'E':
        return f3, f2, 7 - f1
    elif direction == 'S':
        return 7 - f2, f1, f3
    else:  # direction == 'W'
        return f3, f2, 7 - f1

def calculate_faces_after_rolls(n, k, f1, f2, f3):
    # Calculate the number of full cycles
    full_cycle_rolls = (4 * (n - 1))
    remaining_rolls = k % full_cycle_rolls

    # Determine the sequence of directions for the remaining rolls
    sequence = 'E' * (n - 1) + 'S' * (n - 1) + 'W' * (n - 1) + 'N' * (n - 1)

    # Apply the remaining rolls to the dice
    for i in range(remaining_rolls):
        f1, f2, f3 = roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, sequence[i])

    return f1, f2, f3

# Read from zar.in
with open('zar.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Perform the calculations
result = calculate_faces_after_rolls(n, k, f1, f2, f3)

# Write to zar.out
with open('zar.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]} {result[2]}\n')
```

It appears that the previous solution still did not properly calculate the resulting faces after rolling the dice the specified number of times. We need to take into account the path taken by the dice and ensure that the direction changes at the corners of the square correctly. Moreover, the code did not handle the changes in the front and right faces correctly during a roll.

Let's reimplement the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
# zar.py

def roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, moves, n):
    # These represent the bottom face throughout the moves
    bottom_face = 7 - f2
    
    # Moves around one complete cycle
    cycle = 4 * (n - 1)

    # Normalize the number of moves to within one cycle
    moves %= cycle

    for _ in range(moves):
        if f3 == n:  # Moving south
            f1, f2, f3 = f2, 7 - f1, f3
        elif f1 == n:  # Moving west
            f1, f2, f3 = f1, f3, 7 - bottom_face
        elif f3 == 1:  # Moving north
            f1, f2, f3 = 7 - f2, f1, f3
        elif f1 == 1:  # Moving east
            f1, f2, f3 = f1, 7 - f3, bottom_face
        
        # Update the position of f1 and f3 after a move
        if _ < n - 1:  # Moving east
            f1 += 1
        elif _ < 2 * n - 2:  # Moving south
            f3 += 1
        elif _ < 3 * n - 3:  # Moving west
            f1 -= 1
        else:  # Moving north
            f3 -= 1
    
    return f1, f2, f3

# Read from zar.in
with open('zar.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Perform the calculations

# Write to zar.out

To address the incorrect output, let's reanalyze the problem and come up with a correct solution.

The dice rolling on a square path essentially follows a repeating pattern: East for \( n-1 \) times, South for \( n-1 \) times, West for \( n-1 \) times, and North for \( n-1 \) times. The positions where the dice changes direction are at the corners where it has moved \( n-1 \) steps in one direction. 

Given \( k \) moves, we need to find out how many complete cycles are made and the remainder of moves after these complete cycles, as a complete cycle brings the dice back to the starting orientation.

Now, let's correct the solution by properly keeping track of the dice's orientation after each roll and accounting for the corners correctly:

```python
# zar.py

def roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction):
    if direction == 'E':
        return f3, f2, 7 - f1
    elif direction == 'S':
        return 7 - f2, f1, f3
    elif direction == 'W':
        return 7 - f3, f2, f1
    elif direction == 'N':
        return f2, 7 - f1, f3

def calculate_faces_after_rolls(n, k, f1, f2, f3):
    # Normalize k to within one complete cycle
    k %= (4 * (n - 1))
    
    # Directions for a complete cycle around the path
    directions = 'E' * (n - 1) + 'S' * (n - 1) + 'W' * (n - 1) + 'N' * (n - 1)
    
    for i in range(k):
        direction = directions[i % len(directions)]
        f1, f2, f3 = roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction)
    
    return f1, f2, f3

# Read from zar.in
with open('zar.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Perform the calculations
f1, f2, f3 = calculate_faces_after_rolls(n, k, f1, f2, f3)

# Write to zar.out
with open('zar.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{f1} {f2} {f3}\n')

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's take another approach to solve this problem by considering the movements of the dice and the sequence of rolls correctly.

Given that the dice start in the top left corner and move in a clockwise direction, we can determine how the values on the dice faces change with each move.

1. When the dice rolls east (right), the top face becomes the new right face, the bottom face becomes the new top face, and the left face becomes the new bottom face.
2. When the dice rolls south (down), the top face becomes the new front face, the bottom face becomes the new top face, and the back face becomes the new bottom face.
3. When the dice rolls west (left), the top face becomes the new left face, the bottom face becomes the new top face, and the right face becomes the new bottom face.
4. When the dice rolls north (up), the top face becomes the new back face, the bottom face becomes the new top face, and the front face becomes the new bottom face.

We need to keep track of the current top, front, and right faces of the dice, update their values as the dice rolls, and handle the corners where the direction changes.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# zar.py

def next_face(current_face, direction):
    # The opposite face for each face value
    opposite = 7 - current_face
    if direction == 'E':  # Rolling east
        return opposite, current_face
    if direction == 'W':  # Rolling west
        return current_face, opposite
    if direction == 'N':  # Rolling north
        return opposite, current_face
    if direction == 'S':  # Rolling south
        return current_face, opposite

def calculate_faces_after_rolls(n, k, top, front, right):
    # Complete cycle rolls do not affect the final faces
    k %= (4 * (n - 1))
    
    # Determine the direction of the roll based on the remaining moves
    for _ in range(k):
        if right == n - 1:  # At the east corner, start rolling south
            top, front = next_face(top, 'S')
            right = 0
        elif front == n - 1:  # At the south corner, start rolling west
            top, right = next_face(top, 'W')
            front = 0
        elif right == 1 - n:  # At the west corner, start rolling north
            top, front = next_face(top, 'N')
            right = 0
        elif front == 1 - n:  # At the north corner, start rolling east
            top, right = next_face(top, 'E')
            front = 0
        else:  # Continue rolling in the current direction
            if _ < n - 1:  # Rolling east
                right += 1
            elif _ < 2 * (n - 1):  # Rolling south
                front += 1
            elif _ < 3 * (n - 1):  # Rolling west
                right -= 1
            else:  # Rolling north
                front -= 1
    
    return top, 7 - top, right  # Return the top, bottom (opposite of top), and right faces

I will re-evaluate the problem and provide a corrected solution.

The dice have six faces, and when rolled, the current top and bottom faces will switch according to the direction of the roll. The current front and right faces will also change depending on the roll. We need to keep track of these faces throughout the roll sequence to determine their final values.

We know that the sum of the numbers on two opposite faces is always 7, so if we know the number of one face, we immediately know the number on the opposite face.

Given the initial position of the dice and the direction of the roll, we can calculate the new positions of the faces. For example, when rolling east (right), the top becomes the new right, the front remains the front, the right becomes the bottom, and the bottom becomes the left (which becomes the new top when the dice is upright again).

We need to account for the number of rolls that complete the entire square border, as each full perimeter traversal (4 * (n - 1) rolls) will return the dice to its original orientation. After that, we only need to consider the remaining rolls.

I will provide the fixed solution below:

```python
# zar.py

# Given the top and front face, determine the right face
def get_right_face(top, front):
    right_face = 7 - (top + front)
    if right_face == 7 - top or right_face == 7 - front:
        right_face = 14 - (top + front)
    return right_face

# Roll the dice one step and update the top, front, and right faces
def roll(top, front, right, direction):
    if direction == 'E':  # Rolling east
        return right, front, 7 - top
    elif direction == 'S':  # Rolling south
        return front, 7 - top, right
    elif direction == 'W':  # Rolling west
        return 7 - right, front, top
    elif direction == 'N':  # Rolling north
        return 7 - front, top, right

# Perform rolls and return the final faces
def calculate_final_faces(n, k, top, front, right):
    # Calculate total moves in a single traversal of the square
    total_moves_in_cycle = 4 * (n - 1)
    
    # Calculate remaining moves after complete cycles
    remaining_moves = k % total_moves_in_cycle
    
    # Directions order
    directions = ['E'] * (n - 1) + ['S'] * (n - 1) + \
                 ['W'] * (n - 1) + ['N'] * (n - 1)
    
    # Perform the remaining moves
    for i in range(remaining_moves):
        top, front, right = roll(top, front, right, directions[i])
    
    return top, front, right

# Read from zar.in
with open('zar.in', 'r') as fin:
    n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# As the bottom face is not given in the input,
# we calculate the right face from top and front
right_face = get_right_face(f2, f1)

# Perform the calculations
final_top, final_front, final_right = calculate_final_faces(n, k, f2, f1, right_face)

# Write to zar.out
with open('zar.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{final_front} {final_top} {final_right}\n')
```

This revised solution should now correctly handle the dice rolls and determine the final faces after the given number of rolls. The `get_right_face` function is used to determine the correct initial right face, and `roll` updates the faces with each move. The `calculate_final_faces` computes the final faces after all remaining moves. Let's run this and check with the given input data.
