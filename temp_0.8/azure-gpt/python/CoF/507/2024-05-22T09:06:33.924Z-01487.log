Mihai s-a decis în sfârșit să compună o melodie. Fără să știe de unde să înceapă, a scris pe o foaie $n$ note muzicale. Fiecare notă muzicală este definită de două valori reprezentând durata și înălțimea acesteia astfel:
* **durata** este exprimată printr-o fracție de forma $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2^x}$, unde $x$ este un număr natural nenul;
* **înălțimea** este exprimată printr-un număr natural nenul $y$.

Durata unui grup de note este egală cu suma duratelor notelor din grup. Pentru a compune o melodie corect din punct de vedere muzical, el trebuie să distribuie toate notele în grupuri disjuncte, astfel încât durata fiecărui grup să fie $1$. Mihai definește **scorul unui grup** de note ca fiind suma înălțimilor tuturor notelor din grup, ridicată la pătrat. De asemenea, el definește **scorul unei melodii** ca fiind suma scorurilor tuturor grupurilor de note formate
care pot forma un grup.

Mihai vrea să afle care este scorul maxim al unei melodii pe care îl poate obține după gruparea tuturor notelor date.

# Cerință

Dându-se $n$ note sub forma a $n$ perechi de numere, $x$ și $y$, să se afișeze scorul maxim ce poate fi obținut după gruparea tuturor notelor date în grupuri disjuncte.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `partitura.in` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de note, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț, pentru fiecare din cele $n$ note.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `partitura.out` va conține un singur număr natural reprezentând scorul maxim cerut.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 300 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq x \leq 18$;
* $1 \leq y \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că se pot distribui toate notele date în grupuri de durată $1$.
* Pentru $20$ de puncte, $n \leq 4$, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $22$ de puncte, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, pentru toate notele, $x$ are aceeași valoare;
* Pentru $41$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

I've created a Python script that reads the notes from `partitura.in`, computes the maximum score according to the rules described, and writes the score to `partitura.out`. The script uses file operations for I/O as requested (no `input()` or `print()` functions are used).

To fix the issue, we need to properly aggregate the heights of the notes according to their durations, ensuring that we combine them in such a way as to maximize the sum of the squares of the groups' heights. The key to this problem is to recognize that we can always group notes with smaller durations together to make up a larger duration, and we should group the notes with the largest heights together to maximize the score.

We need to ensure that we add the largest heights together first before moving on to the smaller ones, so it's essential to sort the heights in descending order. We'll also need to track how many notes we can combine to form a full duration (which is 1 in this case), which means their combined duration fractions must add up to 1.

I'll rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read notes from the input file
def read_notes(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]
    return notes

# Write the score to the output file
def write_score(filename, score):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(score))

# Compute the maximum score for the given notes
def compute_maximum_score(notes):
    # Organize notes by their duration
    duration_buckets = defaultdict(list)
    for x, y in notes:
        duration_buckets[2**x].append(y)
    
    # Sort the heights in descending order within each duration bucket
    for duration in duration_buckets:
        duration_buckets[duration].sort(reverse=True)
    
    score = 0
    while duration_buckets:  # While there are still notes left
        # Start a new group
        current_group_heights = []
        remaining_duration = 2**18  # Start with the largest possible duration

        # Try to fill the current group with notes, starting with the largest duration
        for duration in sorted(duration_buckets.keys(), reverse=True):
            # Calculate how many notes of this duration we can put in the current group
            num_notes_to_take = min(len(duration_buckets[duration]), remaining_duration // duration)

            # Take the required number of notes with the largest heights and add them to the group
            current_group_heights.extend(duration_buckets[duration][:num_notes_to_take])
            # Remove the taken notes from the bucket
            duration_buckets[duration] = duration_buckets[duration][num_notes_to_take:]

            # Update the remaining duration for the current group
            remaining_duration -= num_notes_to_take * duration

            # If there are no more notes of this duration, remove the bucket
            if not duration_buckets[duration]:
                del duration_buckets[duration]

            # If we've filled the current group, stop and calculate its score
            if remaining_duration == 0:
                break
        
        # Calculate and add the score of the current group to the total score
        group_score = sum(current_group_heights) ** 2
        score += group_score
    
    return score

def main():
    notes = read_notes('partitura.in')
    score = compute_maximum_score(notes)
    write_score('partitura.out', score)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution maintains a `duration_buckets` dictionary, with keys being the note durations (in terms of their power of 2) and values being lists of heights sorted in descending order. For each group, we attempt to fill it with the largest possible notes first, ensuring that we maximize the group's score. We continue this process until all notes are grouped.

The found output indicates that the current solution is not optimally grouping the notes to achieve the maximum score. Specifically, the algorithm appears to be incorrectly selecting notes to form groups, which leads to a higher output score than expected. This suggests that the process of picking notes for each group does not ensure that the sum of the group's height squared is maximized.

To achieve the maximum score, we need to ensure that for each full group (equivalent to a duration of 1), we choose notes in such a way that we maximize the sum of heights in each group before squaring. One efficient way to do this is to use a greedy approach where we combine the highest available notes until we reach a full duration.

Here's the corrected solution that will use a priority queue (heap) to always pick the notes with the highest heights first:

```python
import heapq

# Read notes from the input file
def read_notes(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]
    return notes

# Write the score to the output file
def write_score(filename, score):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(score))

# Compute the maximum score for the given notes
def compute_maximum_score(notes):
    # Heap to store the negative height of notes, we use negative because heapq is a min-heap
    height_heap = []
    duration_counter = defaultdict(int)

    # Initialize the heap with the height of notes and count durations
    for x, y in notes:
        duration = 2**x
        heapq.heappush(height_heap, -y)
        duration_counter[duration] += 1

    score = 0
    # Process until we run out of notes
    while height_heap:
        current_sum = 0
        current_duration = 0
        group_notes = []

        # Combine notes until we reach the full duration
        while current_duration < 2**18 and height_heap:
            y = -heapq.heappop(height_heap)
            for duration, count in sorted(duration_counter.items(), reverse=True):
                if current_duration + duration <= 2**18 and count > 0:
                    current_duration += duration
                    current_sum += y
                    group_notes.append((duration, y))
                    duration_counter[duration] -= 1
                    if duration_counter[duration] == 0:
                        del duration_counter[duration]
                    break

        # Calculate and add the score of the current group to the total score
        score += current_sum**2

        # In case we used notes with smaller durations, they could form a group again
        for duration, y in group_notes:
            if current_duration > 2**18:
                leftover_duration = current_duration - 2**18
                current_duration -= leftover_duration
                heapq.heappush(height_heap, -y)
                duration_counter[leftover_duration] += 1

    return score

def main():
    notes = read_notes('partitura.in')
    score = compute_maximum_score(notes)
    write_score('partitura.out', score)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This updated algorithm uses a heap to always try to use the notes with the largest height first. It tracks the duration of the current group and stops adding notes when it reaches the full duration. If during the process, a note with a smaller duration could be added to make a full group, it is considered, and the remaining duration (if any) is added back to the heap to be used for the next group.

This should produce the correct maximum score for the melody, as it prioritizes combining the highest notes to reach a full duration, thereby maximizing the sum of squares of group heights.

---------- assistant ----------

The exit code 1 and the standard error output indicate a `NameError` because the `defaultdict` class is not defined. This is because the `collections` module, where `defaultdict` is defined, was not imported. To fix the issue, we need to add the following import statement at the beginning of the code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
```

With this import, `defaultdict` will be recognized, and the code should run without the `NameError`. I'll rewrite the full solution with this fix included:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

# Read notes from the input file
def read_notes(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]
    return notes

# Write the score to the output file
def write_score(filename, score):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(score))

# Compute the maximum score for the given notes
def compute_maximum_score(notes):
    # Priority queue to store (negative height, duration)
    pq = []
    # Push all notes into the priority queue with their heights negated (since heapq is a min-heap)
    for x, y in notes:
        duration = 2**(-x)  # Convert duration to fraction of 1
        heapq.heappush(pq, (-y, duration))

    score = 0
    current_duration = 0
    current_heights = []
    
    # Combine notes to form groups with a total duration of 1
    while pq:
        y, duration = heapq.heappop(pq)
        current_duration += duration
        current_heights.append(-y)
        
        # When the current group's total duration reaches 1, calculate its score
        if current_duration == 1:
            score += sum(current_heights) ** 2
            current_duration = 0
            current_heights = []
        elif current_duration > 1:  # This should not happen, as the input guarantees grouping is possible
            raise ValueError("Invalid note grouping")

    return score

def main():
    notes = read_notes('partitura.in')
    score = compute_maximum_score(notes)
    write_score('partitura.out', score)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code now correctly imports `defaultdict` and uses a priority queue (heap) to ensure that we are always taking the highest possible notes to create groups with a total duration of 1 before calculating their score contribution to the melody. If the total duration of a group exceeds 1, the code will raise an error, because according to the problem statement, it is guaranteed that all notes can be grouped into durations of 1.
