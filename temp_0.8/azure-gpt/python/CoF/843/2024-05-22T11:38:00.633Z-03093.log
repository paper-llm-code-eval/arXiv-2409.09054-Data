Fascinat de Egiptul Antic, Rareș vrea să construiască cât mai multe piramide din cartonașe pătratice identice. El are la dispoziție $N$ cartonașe numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, albe sau gri, așezate în ordinea strict crescătoare a numerelor.

Prima piramidă o va construi folosind primele trei cartonașe. Baza piramidei va fi formată din cartonașele $1$ și $2$ așezate alăturat, peste care va așeza cartonașul $3$ (vârful piramidei).

A doua piramidă va avea baza formată din cartonașele $4$, $5$ și $6$ așezate alăturat, deasupra cărora se vor așeza cartonașele $7$ și $8$, alăturate, peste care se va așeza cartonașul $9$ (vârful piramidei).

Mai departe, va construi în ordine piramidele complete cu bazele formate din $4$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $10$ la $13$), respectiv $5$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $20$ la $24$), $6$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $35$ la $40$) etc., cât timp va putea construi o piramidă completă. De exemplu, dacă Rareș are $N = 75$ cartonașe atunci el va construi piramidele complete $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ și $5$ din imaginile următoare. Din cele $75$ de cartonașe el va folosi doar primele $55$ de cartonașe, deoarece ultimele $20$ cartonașe nu sunt suficiente pentru a construi piramida $6$, cu baza formată din $7$ cartonașe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să citească numerele naturale $N$ (reprezentând numărul de cartonașe), $X$ (reprezentând numărul unui cartonaș), $K$ (reprezentând numărul de cartonașe albe), numerele celor $K$ cartonașe albe $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_K$ și care să determine: 

* numărul $P$ al piramidei complete ce conține cartonașul numerotat cu $X$; 
* numărul $M$ maxim de piramide complete construite de Rareș; 
* numărul $C$ de cartonașe nefolosite; 
* numărul $A$ al primei piramide complete care conține cele mai multe cartonașe albe.

A doua linie a fișierului conține, în ordine, cele $K$ numere $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_K$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând numerele celor $K$ cartonașe albe din cele $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `piramide.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul $P$ sau valoarea $0$ (zero) dacă niciuna dintre piramidele complete construite nu conține cartonașul cu numărul $X$.

It seems there is a logical error in the way the program calculates the number of the pyramid that contains the card number X, the maximum number of complete pyramids that can be built, the number of unused cards, and the first complete pyramid with the most white cards.

I will rewrite the functions to correctly address the logic for each part of the problem.

1. For finding the number `P` of the pyramid containing card `X`, we need to calculate how many cards are required to build each pyramid until we reach or surpass card `X`.
2. For finding `M`, the maximum number of complete pyramids, we calculate how many cards are needed for each pyramid until we run out of cards.
3. For `C`, the number of unused cards, we subtract the total number of cards used from `N`.
4. For `A`, the number of the first pyramid with the most white cards, we keep track of the number of white cards in each pyramid and find the pyramid with the largest count.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return N, X, K, white_cards

def write_output(filename, P, M, C, A):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f'{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n')

def find_pyramid_number(X):
    level = 1
    card_count = 0
    while True:
        cards_in_level = (level * (level + 1)) // 2
        if card_count < X <= card_count + cards_in_level:
            return level
        card_count += cards_in_level
        level += 1
    return 0

def find_pyramids_and_unused(N):
    level = 1
    card_count = 0
    while card_count + ((level * (level + 1)) // 2) <= N:
        card_count += (level * (level + 1)) // 2
        level += 1
    return level - 1, N - card_count

def find_max_white_pyramid(K, white_cards):
    max_white = 0
    max_white_pyramid = 0
    card_count = 0
    pyramid_white_count = 0
    level = 1
    for card in white_cards:
        while card_count + ((level * (level + 1)) // 2) < card:
            card_count += (level * (level + 1)) // 2
            if pyramid_white_count > max_white:
                max_white = pyramid_white_count
                max_white_pyramid = level
            pyramid_white_count = 0
            level += 1
        pyramid_white_count += 1
    if pyramid_white_count > max_white:
        max_white = pyramid_white_count
        max_white_pyramid = level
    return max_white_pyramid

def solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards):
    P = find_pyramid_number(X)
    M, C = find_pyramids_and_unused(N)
    A = find_max_white_pyramid(K, white_cards)
    return P, M, C, A

def main():
    N, X, K, white_cards = read_input('piramide.in')
    P, M, C, A = solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards)
    write_output('piramide.out', P, M, C, A)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This implementation should give the correct results according to the problem statement. I have corrected the logic in the `find_pyramid_number`, `find_pyramids_and_unused`, and `find_max_white_pyramid` functions to accurately carry out their respective calculations.

Upon reviewing the previous implementation, it's clear that the logic for finding the pyramid number containing card `X` and the pyramid with the most white cards is incorrect. We need to calculate the pyramid levels differently and keep track of white cards per pyramid correctly.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct logic:

1. For finding the pyramid number `P` containing card `X`, we need to sum successive terms of the series that defines the total number of cards in pyramids of increasing base until we find the term that includes card `X`.
2. For finding `M`, the maximum number of complete pyramids, similar logic applies, but we continue until we cannot build a complete pyramid with the remaining cards.
3. For `C`, the number of unused cards is simply the difference between `N` and the total number of cards used in complete pyramids.
4. For `A`, we need to track white cards per pyramid. We increment the base size for each pyramid and track white cards until we cannot build a complete pyramid with the remaining cards.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def read_input():
    with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
        N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        white_cards = set(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return N, X, K, white_cards

def write_output(P, M, C, A):
    with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")

def solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards):
    # Find P, M, C
    total_cards = 0
    level = 0
    P = M = C = 0
    while total_cards + (level + 1) * (level + 2) // 2 <= N:
        level += 1
        total_cards += level * (level + 1) // 2
        if total_cards < X <= total_cards + level * (level + 1) // 2:
            P = level
        M = level
    C = N - total_cards

    # Find A
    A = 0
    max_white = 0
    last_card = 1
    for i in range(1, level + 1):
        current_level_cards = i * (i + 1) // 2
        white_in_current_level = len(white_cards.intersection(set(range(last_card, last_card + current_level_cards))))
        if white_in_current_level > max_white:
            max_white = white_in_current_level
            A = i
        last_card += current_level_cards

    return P, M, C, A

def main():
    N, X, K, white_cards = read_input()
    P, M, C, A = solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards)
    write_output(P, M, C, A)

main()
```

This revised solution now correctly calculates the pyramid number containing card `X` by considering the pyramid structures and their card counts. It also correctly identifies the pyramid with the most white cards by checking the count of white cards at each level against the set of white cards. The solution should now match the expected output.

I apologize for the confusion. It appears that the implementation still contains errors. Let's attempt to correct the solution step by step.

The first mistake is in counting the white cards for each pyramid level and finding the first pyramid with the most white cards. Instead of using a set intersection, which has a computational complexity of O(n) in the size of the set, we can use a pointer to iterate through the sorted white cards and count how many belong to each pyramid level. This will be more efficient as we can do it in a single pass.

Let's implement the fix:

```python

    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return N, X, K, white_cards

def write_output(filename, P, M, C, A):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")

def solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards):
    total_cards, level, white_index, white_count = 0, 1, 0, 0
    P, M, C, A, max_white = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

    while total_cards + (level * (level + 1) // 2) <= N:
        cards_in_level = (level * (level + 1) // 2)
        if total_cards < X <= total_cards + cards_in_level:
            P = level
        total_cards += cards_in_level
        level += 1

    M = level - 1
    C = N - total_cards

    # Reset counts for white cards
    total_cards, white_count, level = 0, 0, 1
    white_cards.sort()

    for card in white_cards:
        while card > total_cards + (level * (level + 1) // 2):
            if white_count > max_white:
                max_white = white_count
                A = level
            total_cards += level * (level + 1) // 2

            white_count = 0

        if total_cards < card <= total_cards + (level * (level + 1) // 2):
            white_count += 1

# Main execution
def main():

    P, M, C, A = solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards)
    write_output('piramide.out', P, M, C, A)

main()
```

This code should now correctly calculate the number of the pyramid containing card `X`, the maximum number of complete pyramids `M`, the number of unused cards `C`, and the first complete pyramid with the most white cards `A`. It takes into account the structure of the pyramids and the number of cards used in each. It also efficiently counts the white cards in a single pass.

After reviewing the issue again, it seems the previous attempts failed to correctly identify the complete pyramid that contains card `X`, the maximum number of complete pyramids that can be constructed, the number of unused cards, and the complete pyramid that contains the most white cards.

Let's re-analyze and fix the solution. We need to iterate over the possible pyramids to find these values correctly. We will start from a pyramid with a base size of 1 and increase the size for each subsequent pyramid until we reach the card `N`.

Here is the corrected algorithm:

1. To find `P`, the pyramid number containing card `X`, we calculate the total number of cards needed to form all complete pyramids up to and including the one that would contain card `X`.

2. To find `M`, the maximum number of complete pyramids, we continue this process until the sum exceeds `N`.

3. To find `C`, the number of unused cards, we subtract the total number of cards used in complete pyramids from `N`.

4. For `A`, we need to find the pyramid with the most white cards. We'll maintain a count of white cards for each pyramid and update the maximum count accordingly.

Here is the re-implemented solution:

```python
def solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards):
    # Initialize variables
    P = M = C = A = 0
    max_white_in_pyramid = 0
    pyramid_base = 1
    card_count = 0
    white_in_current_pyramid = 0
    white_card_index = 0
    white_cards = sorted(white_cards)

    # Iterate over the pyramids
    while card_count + (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1) // 2) <= N:
        cards_needed = pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1) // 2
        if card_count < X <= card_count + cards_needed:
            P = pyramid_base
        card_count += cards_needed
        M = pyramid_base
        
        # Count white cards for the current pyramid
        while (white_card_index < K and 
               white_cards[white_card_index] <= card_count):
            white_in_current_pyramid += 1
            white_card_index += 1
        
        # Update the pyramid with the most white cards if needed
        if white_in_current_pyramid > max_white_in_pyramid:
            max_white_in_pyramid = white_in_current_pyramid
            A = pyramid_base
            
        white_in_current_pyramid = 0
        pyramid_base += 1

    C = N - card_count

    return P, M, C, (A if max_white_in_pyramid > 0 else 0)

# Read and write utilities are the same
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return N, X, K, white_cards

def write_output(filename, P, M, C, A):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")

# Solve the challenge and output the result
def main():
    N, X, K, white_cards = read_input('piramide.in')
    P, M, C, A = solve_challenge(N, X, K, white_cards)
    write_output('piramide.out', P, M, C, A)

main()
```

This solution should correctly calculate the required values and match the expected output. We ensure that we iterate through the sorted white cards within the loop of pyramid bases, updating the count of white cards and comparing it with the maximum after each pyramid is processed.
