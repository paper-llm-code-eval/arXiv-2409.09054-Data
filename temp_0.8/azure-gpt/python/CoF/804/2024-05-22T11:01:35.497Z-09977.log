Ion Petre, ca oricare adolescent, este pasionat atât de jocuri, cât şi de informatică. Ultimul astfel de joc este acela de a elimina dintr-un text cuvinte astfel încât fiecare cuvânt rămas să fie urmat de un cuvânt care începe cu aceeaşi literă cu care se termină cuvântul precedent. Face excepţie de la această regulă numai ultimul cuvânt.

# Cerinţă

Pentru un text dat:
1) afișați numărul **minim** de cuvinte ce pot fi eliminate astfel încât în textul rămas orice cuvânt (cu excepţia ultimului) să se termine cu aceeaşi literă cu care începe cuvântul următor;
2) afișați numărul de cuvinte din text;
3) afișați cuvintele din text rămase după eliminarea de la prima cerință, fiecare cuvânt fiind afişat pe câte o linie.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul `text.in` conţine un text scris pe mai multe linii. Pe fiecare linie se află cuvinte formate din litere mici ale alfabetului latin. Cuvintele sunt despărţite între ele prin exact câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `text.out` va conţine pe primele doua linii două numerele $x$ şi $y$, unde $x$ va fi numărul minim de cuvinte ce trebuie eliminate, iar $y$ numărul de cuvinte din text. Pe liniile următoare se vor afişa, în ordine, cuvintele rămase după eliminarea celor $y$ cuvinte, câte un cuvant pe o linie.

# Restricții și precizări

*	Numărul de cuvinte din text este maximum $20 \ 000$.
*	Lungimea maximă a unui cuvânt este $20$.
*	Fiecare linie de text din fişierul de intrare are cel mult $200$ de caractere.
*	În fişierul de intrare pot exista rânduri goale.
*	Se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe.
*	Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primelor două cerinţe.
*	Pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă tot punctajul.
*   **Notă**: exemplul de pe PDF este afișat în mod invers față de cum este afișat în teste.

The error is caused by a `KeyError` in the `visited` dictionary, meaning we attempted to access a key that does not exist. This can happen if there is a letter that is the end of a word but not the start of any word, which was not added to the `visited` dictionary correctly.

We must ensure that every letter that appears as the first or last character of any word is present in the `visited`, `in_degree`, and `out_degree` dictionaries. Let's fix the code accordingly, and be sure it will handle all letters correctly.

```python
# Read the input file and store words

The output of the program indicates that the reconstruction of the word chain is incorrect. The algorithm used for reconstructing the path did not properly link the words together using the first and last letters; instead, it just connected the first and last letters of words without actually using the words themselves. Moreover, it didn't account for the condition that the first letter of the following word should match the last letter of the current word.

The correct algorithm should:

1. Build a graph representing possible transitions from the last letter of a word to the first letter of another word.
2. Use a depth-first search (DFS) to find the longest path in this graph, this will minimize the number of words removed.
3. Reconstruct the actual words from the longest path found by the DFS.

Let's write a different solution to fix these problems, ensuring we use the actual words for reconstruction and correctly identify the longest path:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the input file and store words
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = [word for line in fin for word in line.split() if word]

# Initialize data structures
graph = defaultdict(list)
word_count = defaultdict(int)
in_degree = defaultdict(int)
out_degree = defaultdict(int)

# Populate the graph
for word in words:
    start, end = word[0], word[-1]
    graph[start].append(word)
    word_count[word] += 1
    in_degree[end] += 1
    out_degree[start] += 1

# Find starting point
start_char = None
for char, out_deg in out_degree.items():
    if out_deg > in_degree[char]:
        start_char = char
        break
if not start_char:
    start_char = words[0][0]

# Reconstruct the path
path = []
current_char = start_char
while graph[current_char]:
    next_word = graph[current_char].pop()
    path.append(next_word)
    current_char = next_word[-1]

# The number of words to remove is the total count minus the length of the path
words_to_remove = len(words) - len(path)

# Write the output file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{len(words)}\n")
    fout.write('\n'.join(path))
```

This algorithm resolves the issues by:

- Building a graph where each node is a letter and edges are words connecting letters.
- Identifying a starting letter based on the difference between out-degree and in-degree.
- Reconstructing the path, leveraging the graph to pick words, ensuring the continuity based on the last and first letters.
- Writing the reconstructed path to the output file, one word per line.

The implementation attempted to build a path directly from the graph, but it appears to have selected words incorrectly, leading to an incorrect path and an incorrect number of words to remove. The expected output suggests that not only do we need to create a longest path in terms of the graph of letters, but we also need to ensure that we are using the original words and maintaining their order as much as possible.

To address this challenge correctly, we need to:

1. Construct a directed graph where each node represents a letter, and each directed edge represents a possible transition from one word to another by connecting the last letter of a word to the first letter of the next word.
2. Use a depth-first search (DFS) or a dynamic programming approach to find the longest path in this graph, which corresponds to the sequence of words with the minimum number of words removed.
3. Reconstruct the actual sequence of words corresponding to this longest path.

Here's a revised solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read the input file and store words
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = [word.strip() for line in fin for word in line.split()]

# Function to perform a topological sort on the graph
def topological_sort(graph):
    in_degree = defaultdict(int)
    for node in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in graph if in_degree[node] == 0])
    top_order = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        top_order.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return top_order

# Build the graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
word_to_index = {}
index_to_word = {}
index = 0
for word in words:
    if word not in word_to_index:
        word_to_index[word] = index
        index_to_word[index] = word
        index += 1
    last_char = word[-1]
    for next_word in words:
        if word != next_word and last_char == next_word[0]:
            graph[word_to_index[word]].append(word_to_index[next_word])

# Find the longest path using dynamic programming
top_order = topological_sort(graph)
longest_path = defaultdict(int)
predecessor = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
for node in top_order:
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if longest_path[node] + 1 > longest_path[neighbor]:
            longest_path[neighbor] = longest_path[node] + 1
            predecessor[neighbor] = node

# Reconstruct the longest path
end_word_index = max(longest_path, key=longest_path.get)
path = []
while end_word_index != -1:
    path.append(index_to_word[end_word_index])
    end_word_index = predecessor[end_word_index]

# Reverse the path to get the correct order
path = path[::-1]

# The number of words to remove is the total count minus the length of the path
words_to_remove = len(words) - len(path)

# Write the output file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{len(words)}\n")
    for word in path:
        fout.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This revised solution calculates the longest path correctly and constructs the output sequence of words based on the longest path found. It uses a topological sorting to iterate through the graph in a valid order for dynamic programming. The longest path for each node is calculated, and then the path is reconstructed from the node with the longest path. The resulting words are written to the output file, one per line.

The error indicates that there is a `KeyError` in the `word_to_index` dictionary, which is used to map words to their respective indices. The issue occurs because the code attempts to find the index of a word that may not have been added to the dictionary yet. This can happen if a word appears as the next possible word in the sequence before it has been encountered as the current word.

To fix this, we need to ensure that all words are added to `word_to_index` and `index_to_word` before constructing the graph. Let's first make sure all words have an index, and then use that index to build the graph.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the input file and store words
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = [word.strip() for line in fin for word in line.split() if word]

# Assign indices to all unique words
word_to_index = {word: index for index, word in enumerate(words)}
index_to_word = {index: word for word, index in word_to_index.items()}

# Build the graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
for word in words:
    start, end = word[0], word[-1]
    for next_word in words:
        if end == next_word[0] and word != next_word:
            graph[word_to_index[word]].append(word_to_index[next_word])

# Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the longest path
def dfs(node, graph, visited, memo):
    if visited[node]:
        return 0
    if node in memo:
        return memo[node]
    visited[node] = True
    longest_path = 1  # Count the current word
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        longest_path = max(longest_path, 1 + dfs(neighbor, graph, visited, memo))
    visited[node] = False
    memo[node] = longest_path
    return longest_path

# Find the longest path for all starting points
visited = {node: False for node in word_to_index.values()}
memo = {}
max_path_length = 0
for node in word_to_index.values():
    max_path_length = max(max_path_length, dfs(node, graph, visited, memo))

# The number of words to remove is the total count minus the longest path
words_to_remove = len(words) - max_path_length

# Reconstruct the longest path for the output
def reconstruct_path(node, graph, memo):
    path = [index_to_word[node]]
    while memo[node] > 1:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if memo[node] == 1 + memo[neighbor]:
                path.append(index_to_word[neighbor])
                node = neighbor
                break
    return path

# Find the end of the longest path to start reconstruction
end_of_longest_path = max(memo.keys(), key=lambda k: memo[k])
longest_path = reconstruct_path(end_of_longest_path, graph, memo)

# Write the output file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{len(words)}\n")
    fout.write('\n'.join(longest_path))
```

This solution builds a directed graph where each node represents a unique word, and edges represent possible transitions based on matching last and first characters. We use a DFS to find the longest path in this graph, and then reconstruct the path to provide the correct sequence of words. This ensures that we maintain the order of words and their connections as per the game's rules.

The expected result indicates that the longest path of words following the given rules must be found and that the words should be selected in the original order as they appear in the input. The previous solution did not ensure that the words remain in their original order, which is a requirement for the correct solution.

We need to use a different approach that considers both the chaining rule (last letter of the current word is the first letter of the next word) and maintaining the original order of words.

A viable approach would be to:

1. Create a directed graph where each word is a node and there's a directed edge from word A to word B if the last character of A is the same as the first character of B and A appears before B in the original text.
2. Find the longest path in this graph that maintains the original order of words.
3. The words in this longest path will be the ones that remain in the text, and the rest are removed.

Here's a Python solution that implements this approach:

```python
# Read the input file and store words
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = [word for line in fin for word in line.split() if word]

# Build the graph
graph = {}
for i, word in enumerate(words):
    graph[i] = []
    for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
        if word[-1] == words[j][0]:
            graph[i].append(j)

# Find the longest path using dynamic programming
longest_paths = defaultdict(int)
predecessors = defaultdict(lambda: None)

# Start from the last word and go backwards
for i in reversed(range(len(words))):
    for neighbor in graph[i]:
        if longest_paths[i] < 1 + longest_paths[neighbor]:
            longest_paths[i] = 1 + longest_paths[neighbor]
            predecessors[i] = neighbor

# Reconstruct the longest path
start = max(longest_paths, key=longest_paths.get)
path = []
while start is not None:
    path.append(words[start])
    start = predecessors[start]

# The number of words to remove is the total count minus the longest path
words_to_remove = len(words) - len(path)

# Write the output file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{len(words)}\n")
    fout.write('\n'.join(path))
```

This solution initializes the graph in such a way that only permissible transitions that maintain the original order are allowed. We then use dynamic programming to find the longest path of indices that represent the chain of words. The reconstruction starts from the word which provides the longest path and traces back through the predecessors. Lastly, the solution writes the count of words to be removed, the total word count, and the remaining words to `text.out` file.

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The error message indicates that `defaultdict` is not defined, which means that the `collections` module was not imported correctly. To fix this error, we need to import `defaultdict` from the `collections` module at the beginning of the script.

Let me correct this and rewrite the entire solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the input file and store words
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = [word for line in fin for word in line.split() if word]

# Build the graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
for i, word in enumerate(words):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
        if word[-1] == words[j][0]:
            graph[i].append(j)

# Find the longest path using dynamic programming
longest_paths = defaultdict(lambda: 1)  # Each word is a path of length 1
predecessors = defaultdict(lambda: None)

# Start from the last word and go backwards
for i in reversed(range(len(words))):
    for neighbor in graph[i]:
        if longest_paths[i] < 1 + longest_paths[neighbor]:
            longest_paths[i] = 1 + longest_paths[neighbor]
            predecessors[i] = neighbor

# Reconstruct the longest path
start = max(longest_paths, key=longest_paths.get)
path = []
while start is not None:
    path.append(words[start])
    start = predecessors[start]

# The number of words to remove is the total count minus the longest path
words_to_remove = len(words) - len(path)

# Write the output file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{len(words)}\n")
    fout.write('\n'.join(path))
```

This corrected solution should now work as intended. It uses dynamic programming to find the longest path in the graph of words, maintaining the original order, and then writes the result to the `text.out` file.
