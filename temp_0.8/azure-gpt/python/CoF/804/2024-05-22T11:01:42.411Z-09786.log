Ion Petre, ca oricare adolescent, este pasionat atât de jocuri, cât şi de informatică. Ultimul astfel de joc este acela de a elimina dintr-un text cuvinte astfel încât fiecare cuvânt rămas să fie urmat de un cuvânt care începe cu aceeaşi literă cu care se termină cuvântul precedent. Face excepţie de la această regulă numai ultimul cuvânt.

# Cerinţă

Pentru un text dat:
1) afișați numărul **minim** de cuvinte ce pot fi eliminate astfel încât în textul rămas orice cuvânt (cu excepţia ultimului) să se termine cu aceeaşi literă cu care începe cuvântul următor;
2) afișați numărul de cuvinte din text;
3) afișați cuvintele din text rămase după eliminarea de la prima cerință, fiecare cuvânt fiind afişat pe câte o linie.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul `text.in` conţine un text scris pe mai multe linii. Pe fiecare linie se află cuvinte formate din litere mici ale alfabetului latin. Cuvintele sunt despărţite între ele prin exact câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `text.out` va conţine pe primele doua linii două numerele $x$ şi $y$, unde $x$ va fi numărul minim de cuvinte ce trebuie eliminate, iar $y$ numărul de cuvinte din text. Pe liniile următoare se vor afişa, în ordine, cuvintele rămase după eliminarea celor $y$ cuvinte, câte un cuvant pe o linie.

# Restricții și precizări

*	Numărul de cuvinte din text este maximum $20 \ 000$.
*	Lungimea maximă a unui cuvânt este $20$.
*	Fiecare linie de text din fişierul de intrare are cel mult $200$ de caractere.
*	În fişierul de intrare pot exista rânduri goale.
*	Se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe.
*	Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primelor două cerinţe.
*	Pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă tot punctajul.
*   **Notă**: exemplul de pe PDF este afișat în mod invers față de cum este afișat în teste.

The error indicates that there is a `KeyError` when trying to access the graph with a key that does not exist. This happened because the graph was being created using only the last letters of each word as keys, without considering that a word could also start with that letter. Therefore, when looking for the start of a path from a word that begins with a letter that was not at the end of any word, it caused the `KeyError`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that every word is a key in the graph, and the graph should contain all possible connections (edges) between words where the last letter of one word matches the first letter of another.

Here is the revised code that fixes the issue:

```python
# Define function for getting the first and last letter of a word
def get_edges(word):
    return word[0], word[-1]

# Read the text from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = [word.strip() for line in file for word in line.split()]

# Count total number of words
num_words = len(words)

# Building the graph where each word is a node and edge exists if last 
# letter of word1 == first letter of word2 and they are not the same word
graph = {}
for word in words:
    last_letter = word[-1]
    if last_letter not in graph:
        graph[last_letter] = []
    for next_word in words:
        if next_word != word and next_word[0] == last_letter:
            graph[last_letter].append(next_word)

# Find the longest path using dynamic programming
def longest_path(word):
    if word in memo:
        return memo[word]
    max_length, next_word = 1, None
    for neighbour in graph.get(word[-1], []):
        if neighbour != word:
            length = 1 + longest_path(neighbour)
            if length > max_length:
                max_length, next_word = length, neighbour
    memo[word] = max_length
    if next_word:
        word_sequence[word] = next_word
    return max_length

memo = {}
word_sequence = {}
longest_length = 0
last_word = None
for word in words:
    length = longest_path(word)
    if length > longest_length:
        longest_length = length
        last_word = word

# Construct longest sequence by backtracking
longest_sequence = []
while last_word:
    longest_sequence.append(last_word)
    last_word = word_sequence.get(last_word)

# Calculate the number of words to remove to satisfy the condition
words_to_remove = num_words - len(longest_sequence)

# Write the output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{num_words}\n")
    for word in reversed(longest_sequence):
        file.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This code should correctly calculate the longest chain of words, where the last letter of each word matches the first letter of the next word, while minimizing the number of words that need to be removed. It then writes the results to the `text.out` file in the specified format.

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

---------- assistant ----------

The error indicates that the maximum recursion depth has been exceeded. This usually happens when the recursion is too deep, and the function calls itself many times without reaching a base case. In Python, the default maximum recursion depth is relatively low (usually 1000), and can be hit easily with deep recursion.

To fix this issue, we can convert the recursive approach to a dynamic programming one using an iterative method to avoid deep recursion. This way, we can build the longest path without relying on the call stack size.

Here is the revised code:

```python
# Read the text from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = [word.strip() for line in file if word.strip()]

# Count total number of words
num_words = len(words)

# Building the graph where each word is a node and edge exists if last 
# letter of word1 == first letter of word2 and they are not the same word
graph = {}
in_degree = {}
for word in words:
    first, last = word[0], word[-1]
    if first not in graph:
        graph[first] = []
    graph[first].append(word)
    in_degree[word] = 0

# Count in-degrees for topological sort
for word in words:
    last_letter = word[-1]
    if last_letter in graph:
        for next_word in graph[last_letter]:
            in_degree[next_word] += 1

# Find the longest path using topological sorting
ordering = []
queue = [word for word in words if in_degree[word] == 0]
while queue:
    word = queue.pop()
    ordering.append(word)
    for next_word in graph.get(word[-1], []):
        in_degree[next_word] -= 1
        if in_degree[next_word] == 0:
            queue.append(next_word)

# Find the longest path from the topological ordering
longest_sequence = []
longest_paths = {word: [word] for word in ordering}
for word in ordering:
    for next_word in graph.get(word[-1], []):
        if len(longest_paths[word]) + 1 > len(longest_paths.get(next_word, [])):
            longest_paths[next_word] = longest_paths[word] + [next_word]
longest_sequence = max(longest_paths.values(), key=len)

# Calculate the number of words to remove to satisfy the condition
words_to_remove = num_words - len(longest_sequence)

# Write the output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{num_words}\n")
    for word in longest_sequence:
        file.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This approach should solve the problem without hitting the recursion depth limit and efficiently calculate the longest valid sequence of words. The results are then written to the `text.out` file.

The error was caused by an incorrect variable reference in the list comprehension. It seems I mistakenly used `word.strip()` in the condition of the list comprehension instead of `line.strip()`. The `word` variable is not defined at that point because it's supposed to be the output of the inner loop that splits the line into words.

Let's correct that and also refine our approach to solving the problem. We need to ensure that we are not only finding the longest path but also that we are minimizing the number of words removed.

Here's the corrected and optimized code:

```python
# Read the text from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = [word for line in file for word in line.split()]

# Count total number of words
num_words = len(words)

# Build the graph with adjacency list
graph = {}
for word in words:
    if word[-1] not in graph:
        graph[word[-1]] = []
    graph[word[-1]].append(word)

# Function to find the longest path starting from a given word
def find_longest_path(word, visited):
    # Use memoization to avoid re-computation
    if word in visited:
        return visited[word]
    
    max_path = [word]
    if word[-1] in graph:
        for next_word in graph[word[-1]]:
            if next_word != word:
                path = find_longest_path(next_word, visited)
                if len(path) > len(max_path):
                    max_path = [word] + path
    
    visited[word] = max_path
    return max_path

# Use memoization to store the longest path starting from each word
visited = {}
longest_path = []

# Find the longest path in the graph
for word in words:
    path = find_longest_path(word, visited)
    if len(path) > len(longest_path):
        longest_path = path

# Calculate the number of words to remove to satisfy the condition
words_to_remove = num_words - len(longest_path)

# Write the output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{num_words}\n")
    for word in longest_path:
        file.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This code now correctly reads the words from the file, constructs a graph based on the last character of each word, and then finds the longest path in that graph, representing the longest sequence of words where each word starts with the last character of the previous word. It outputs the count of removed words and the remaining words in the specified format to 'text.out'.

The error indicates that once again the maximum recursion depth has been exceeded due to deep recursion. Since the previous fixes still resulted in a recursive approach, I will now revise the solution to use an iterative approach for finding the longest path. This approach should avoid the recursion depth issue.

Below is the revised solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the text from the file
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = [word for line in file for word in line.split()]

# Count total number of words
num_words = len(words)

# Build the graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
for word in words:
    graph[word[0]].append(word)

# Function to find the longest path in the graph
def find_longest_path(graph):
    # Initialize memoization dictionary
    memo = {word: (1, '') for word in words}
    # Sort the words based on their last letter to ensure we can build on previous results
    sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda w: w[-1])
    # Loop through sorted words and build longest paths
    for word in sorted_words:
        length, _ = memo[word]
        for next_word in graph[word[-1]]:
            if memo[next_word][0] < length + 1:
                memo[next_word] = (length + 1, word)

    # Find the word that ends the longest path
    end_of_longest, _ = max(memo.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    # Reconstruct the longest path
    longest_path = []
    while end_of_longest:
        longest_path.append(end_of_longest)
        end_of_longest = memo[end_of_longest][1]

    return longest_path

# Find the longest path
longest_path = find_longest_path(graph)

# Calculate the number of words to remove to satisfy the condition
words_to_remove = num_words - len(longest_path)

# Write the output to the file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{num_words}\n")
    for word in reversed(longest_path):  # Reverse the path to get the correct order
        file.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This solution uses an iterative approach with dynamic programming to find the longest path. It avoids recursion by building upon previously computed longest paths for words. The results are then written to the `text.out` file.

The current solution does not produce the expected output because it attempts to find the longest path in the graph but does not follow the rules that each word should be followed by a word that starts with the same letter it ends with. The rules also allow for any sequence, not just the longest one, which means that there can be multiple correct solutions. We should aim to build the correct sequence from start to end rather than maximizing length.

Let's implement a different algorithm that will try to construct the sequence by adding words that follow the rules. It will select the next word that starts with the last letter of the current word and keep track of the sequence to ensure it follows the rules. 

Here's the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
# Initialize variables
graph = {}
in_degree = {}
out_degree = {}

# Read from file and build graph
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = []
    for line in file:
        for word in line.split():
            words.append(word)
            if word[-1] not in graph:
                graph[word[-1]] = []
            if word[0] not in in_degree:
                in_degree[word[0]] = 0
            in_degree[word[0]] += 1
            if word not in out_degree:
                out_degree[word] = 0
            out_degree[word] += 1

# Function to find the sequence
def find_sequence():
    # Start with a word with the smallest out-degree (preferably 1)
    current_word = min(words, key=lambda w: out_degree.get(w, 0))
    sequence = [current_word]

    # Build the sequence
    while True:
        last_letter = current_word[-1]
        if last_letter in graph and graph[last_letter]:
            next_word = graph[last_letter].pop(0)  # Get the next word
            sequence.append(next_word)
            current_word = next_word
        else:
            break

    return sequence

# Find the sequence
sequence = find_sequence()

# Calculate the number of words to remove
words_to_remove = len(words) - len(sequence)

# Write to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{len(words)}\n")
    for word in sequence:
        file.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This implementation starts with a word that has the smallest out-degree (indicating that it's less likely to have a valid following word). If there are multiple words with the same smallest out-degree, it will choose the first one it finds. After writing the first word to the sequence, it looks for the next word that starts with the last letter of the current word. This process continues until no more words can be added to the sequence following the rule. The code then outputs the number of words removed and the final sequence to the `text.out` file, which should match the expected format.

The current approach incorrectly selects the starting word and does not ensure that the selected sequence is the longest possible that satisfies the rules. The algorithm needs to correctly identify all possible paths and select the longest one. Let's rewrite the solution with a correct algorithm that finds the longest sequence satisfying the criteria.

We will use a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible sequences and keep track of the longest valid sequence found. Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read from file and preprocess text
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = [line.strip() for line in file.read().splitlines() if line.strip()]
    words = ' '.join(words).split()

# Count total number of words
num_words = len(words)

# Construct a mapping from last to first letters
graph = {}
for word in words:
    last_letter = word[-1]
    if last_letter not in graph:
        graph[last_letter] = []
    graph[last_letter].append(word)

# Depth-first search to find longest sequence
def dfs(word, graph, path, visited):
    visited.add(word)
    path.append(word)
    next_letter = word[-1]
    if next_letter in graph:
        for next_word in graph[next_letter]:
            if next_word not in visited:
                dfs(next_word, graph, path, visited)
    return path

# Find longest sequence
longest_sequence = []
for word in words:
    sequence = dfs(word, graph, [], set())
    if len(sequence) > len(longest_sequence):
        longest_sequence = sequence

# Calculate words to remove
words_to_remove = num_words - len(longest_sequence)

# Write output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{words_to_remove}\n{num_words}\n")
    for word in longest_sequence:
        file.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This solution performs a DFS for every word in the text. It tracks visited words to prevent cycles and ensure each word is used only once. The DFS is used to find all valid sequences, and it updates the longest sequence if a longer one is found. After finding the longest sequence, the code outputs the number of words to remove and the words in the sequence to `text.out`.
