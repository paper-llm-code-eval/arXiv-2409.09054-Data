Ion Petre, ca oricare adolescent, este pasionat atât de jocuri, cât şi de informatică. Ultimul astfel de joc este acela de a elimina dintr-un text cuvinte astfel încât fiecare cuvânt rămas să fie urmat de un cuvânt care începe cu aceeaşi literă cu care se termină cuvântul precedent. Face excepţie de la această regulă numai ultimul cuvânt.

# Cerinţă

Pentru un text dat:
1) afișați numărul **minim** de cuvinte ce pot fi eliminate astfel încât în textul rămas orice cuvânt (cu excepţia ultimului) să se termine cu aceeaşi literă cu care începe cuvântul următor;
2) afișați numărul de cuvinte din text;
3) afișați cuvintele din text rămase după eliminarea de la prima cerință, fiecare cuvânt fiind afişat pe câte o linie.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul `text.in` conţine un text scris pe mai multe linii. Pe fiecare linie se află cuvinte formate din litere mici ale alfabetului latin. Cuvintele sunt despărţite între ele prin exact câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `text.out` va conţine pe primele doua linii două numerele $x$ şi $y$, unde $x$ va fi numărul minim de cuvinte ce trebuie eliminate, iar $y$ numărul de cuvinte din text. Pe liniile următoare se vor afişa, în ordine, cuvintele rămase după eliminarea celor $y$ cuvinte, câte un cuvant pe o linie.

# Restricții și precizări

*	Numărul de cuvinte din text este maximum $20 \ 000$.
*	Lungimea maximă a unui cuvânt este $20$.
*	Fiecare linie de text din fişierul de intrare are cel mult $200$ de caractere.
*	În fişierul de intrare pot exista rânduri goale.
*	Se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe.
*	Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primelor două cerinţe.
*	Pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă tot punctajul.
*   **Notă**: exemplul de pe PDF este afișat în mod invers față de cum este afișat în teste.

The provided implementation had an incorrect approach to solving the problem. The goal of the problem is to order the words so that each word starts with the same letter the previous word ended with. The incorrect result indicates that the program failed to establish the right sequence and eliminate the minimum number of words to form a correct sequence as per the requirements.

A correct approach would be to use a greedy algorithm that iterates over the words, attempting to form the longest possible chain. The chain starts with the first word and then looks for the next word that starts with the letter that the last word ended with. If no such word exists, the chain ends, and we start looking for the next possible starting word.

I will now provide the corrected implementation:

```python
def create_chain(words):
    # Create a mapping of the first letter to a list of words starting with that letter.
    first_letter_to_words = defaultdict(list)
    for word in words:
        first_letter_to_words[word[0]].append(word)

    # Initialize the word chain with the first word and setup used word set
    word_chain = [words[0]]
    used_words = set([words[0]])

    # Greedily construct the chain
    while True:
        last_letter = word_chain[-1][-1]
        found_next = False
        for next_word in first_letter_to_words[last_letter]:
            if next_word not in used_words:
                word_chain.append(next_word)
                used_words.add(next_word)
                found_next = True
                break
        if not found_next:  # If no next word is found, the chain cannot be extended further
            break

    return word_chain

# Read input from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = fin.read().split()

# Get the chain of words
word_chain = create_chain(words)

# Calculate the number of words to eliminate
eliminated_word_count = len(words) - len(word_chain)

# Write output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{eliminated_word_count}\n{len(words)}\n")
    for word in word_chain:
        fout.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This implementation reads the input from `text.in`, processes the data by attempting to form the longest chain of words according to the problem's rules, and writes the output to `text.out`, following the specified format.

The error occurred because the `defaultdict` needs to be imported from the `collections` module, and it seems I neglected to include this import statement. I will make sure to include it in my corrected implementation.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to create the chain of words
def create_chain(words):
    # Create a mapping of the first letter to a list of words starting with that letter.
    first_letter_to_words = defaultdict(list)
    for word in words:
        first_letter_to_words[word[0]].append(word)

    # Initialize the word chain with the first word and setup used word set
    word_chain = [words[0]]
    used_words = set([words[0]])

    # Greedily construct the chain
    while True:
        last_word = word_chain[-1]
        last_letter = last_word[-1]
        found_next = False
        if last_letter in first_letter_to_words:
            for next_word in first_letter_to_words[last_letter]:
                if next_word not in used_words:
                    word_chain.append(next_word)
                    used_words.add(next_word)
                    found_next = True
                    break
        if not found_next:  # If no next word is found, the chain cannot be extended further
            break

    return word_chain

# Read input from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = fin.read().split()

# Get the chain of words
word_chain = create_chain(words)

# Calculate the number of words to eliminate
eliminated_word_count = len(words) - len(word_chain)

# Write output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{eliminated_word_count}\n{len(words)}\n")
    for word in word_chain:
        fout.write(f"{word}\n")
```

In this corrected program, the `defaultdict` is properly imported, and the rest of the code remains the same, providing the functionality as described in the previous explanation. This should compile and execute correctly, handling the input and output as required by the problem statement.

The provided solution does not match the expected result because it greedily constructs a chain starting with the first word and continuing until no more words can be added. This method does not guarantee the minimum number of words are eliminated to satisfy the problem's requirements, as it does not consider all possible paths.

A correct approach to solving this problem would be to construct a graph where each unique letter represents a node, and directed edges exist from the last letter of a word to the first letter of the next word. Once the graph is built, we need to find the longest path in this graph, which would represent the longest chain of words where each word starts with the same letter the previous word ended with. The difference between the total number of words and the length of this longest path will give the minimum number of words that must be eliminated.

Let's implement a better solution that finds the longest path in the graph to minimize the number of words removed:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def longest_path(graph, indegree, start_node):
    # Topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm
    queue = deque([start_node])
    top_order = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        top_order.append(node)
        for next_node in graph[node]:
            indegree[next_node] -= 1
            if indegree[next_node] == 0:
                queue.append(next_node)

    # Find the longest path in the topologically sorted order
    longest_path = {node: 0 for node in top_order}
    for node in top_order:
        for next_node in graph[node]:
            if longest_path[node] + 1 > longest_path[next_node]:
                longest_path[next_node] = longest_path[node] + 1

    # Get the length of the longest path and the last node in the path
    max_length = 0
    last_node = None
    for node, length in longest_path.items():
        if length > max_length:
            max_length = length
            last_node = node

    # Reconstruct the longest path
    path = []
    while last_node is not None:
        path.append(last_node)
        max_length -= 1
        for prev_node in graph:
            if longest_path[prev_node] == max_length and last_node in graph[prev_node]:
                last_node = prev_node
                break
        else:
            last_node = None

    return list(reversed(path))

# Read input from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = fin.read().split()

# Create graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
indegree = defaultdict(int)
unique_letters = set()
for word in words:
    first_letter = word[0]
    last_letter = word[-1]
    graph[last_letter].append(first_letter)
    indegree[first_letter] += 1
    unique_letters.update([first_letter, last_letter])

# Find the start node (any node with 0 indegree)
start_node = next((node for node in unique_letters if indegree[node] == 0), None)

# Find the longest path in the graph
longest_path = longest_path(graph, indegree, start_node) if start_node else []

# Map letters to words for reconstruction
letter_to_word = defaultdict(deque)
for word in words:
    letter_to_word[word[0]].append(word)

# Reconstruct the words from the longest path
word_chain = []
for letter in longest_path:
    if letter_to_word[letter]:
        word_chain.append(letter_to_word[letter].popleft())

# Calculate the number of words to eliminate
eliminated_word_count = len(words) - len(word_chain)

# Write output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{eliminated_word_count}\n{len(words)}\n")
    for word in word_chain:
        fout.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This solution builds a graph, finds the longest path, and reconstructs the word chain based on this path. It writes the minimum number of words to be eliminated and the total number of words to `text.out`, followed by the words that form the longest chain, each on a new line.

The error `KeyError: 'a'` indicates that we are trying to access a value in the `longest_path` dictionary using a key that does not exist. The issue arises because we are only initializing the `longest_path` dictionary with nodes that are in the topological order (`top_order`). However, there may be nodes in the graph that are not part of this topological sort due to them not having any incoming edges (indegree of 0).

The solution is to ensure that all nodes (unique letters) are initialized in the `longest_path` dictionary before we attempt to access them. Let's correct this and also fix the naming conflict where the function and the variable have the same name `longest_path`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Function to find the longest path in the graph
def find_longest_path(graph, indegree, unique_letters):
    # Initialize the longest_path dictionary for all unique letters
    longest_path = {letter: 0 for letter in unique_letters}
    
    # Topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm
    queue = deque([letter for letter in unique_letters if indegree[letter] == 0])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for next_node in graph[node]:
            indegree[next_node] -= 1
            if indegree[next_node] == 0:
                queue.append(next_node)
            # Relaxation step to find the longest path
            if longest_path[node] + 1 > longest_path[next_node]:
                longest_path[next_node] = longest_path[node] + 1

    # Find the letter with the longest path
    max_length = max(longest_path.values())
    last_letter = [letter for letter, length in longest_path.items() if length == max_length][0]

    # Reconstruct the longest path
    path = [last_letter]
    while max_length:
        max_length -= 1
        for prev_node in graph:
            if longest_path[prev_node] == max_length and last_letter in graph[prev_node]:
                path.append(prev_node)
                last_letter = prev_node
                break

    return path[::-1]  # Return the reversed path for correct order

# Read input from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = fin.read().split()

# Create graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
indegree = defaultdict(int)
unique_letters = set()

# Populate the graph and indegree counts
for word in words:
    first_letter = word[0]
    last_letter = word[-1]
    graph[first_letter].append(last_letter)
    indegree[last_letter] += 1
    unique_letters.update([first_letter, last_letter])

# Find the longest path in the graph
longest_chain = find_longest_path(graph, indegree, unique_letters)

# Reconstruct the longest chain of words based on the longest path of letters
word_chain = []
letter_to_words = defaultdict(deque)
for word in words:
    letter_to_words[word[0]].append(word)

for letter in longest_chain:
    if letter_to_words[letter]:
        word_chain.append(letter_to_words[letter].popleft())

# Calculate the number of words to eliminate
eliminated_word_count = len(words) - len(word_chain)

# Write output to file
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{eliminated_word_count}\n{len(words)}\n")
    for word in word_chain:
        fout.write(f"{word}\n")
```

This updated code should no longer throw a `KeyError` and should correctly find the longest chain of words and output the results to `text.out` as expected.

The previous solution attempts to find the longest path in a directed graph, which is not the correct approach for this problem. The task at hand is to find the sequence of words (not letters) where each word starts with the same letter that the previous word ended with.

Since the expected output indicates a specific sequence of words and the number of words to be eliminated, we need a different approach that considers the words and their connections, rather than treating individual letters as nodes.

Here's the revised solution that should produce the correct output:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read words from file
with open('text.in', 'r') as fin:
    words = fin.read().split()

# Create a graph of words where edges represent valid transitions between words
graph = defaultdict(list)
for word in words:
    graph[word[-1]].append(word)

# Find the longest path of words starting from each word in the list
max_chain = []
for first_word in words:
    stack = [(first_word, [first_word])]
    visited = {first_word}
    while stack:
        current_word, current_chain = stack.pop()
        if len(current_chain) > len(max_chain):
            max_chain = current_chain[:]
        for next_word in graph[current_word[0]]:
            if next_word not in visited:
                visited.add(next_word)
                stack.append((next_word, current_chain + [next_word]))
                visited.remove(next_word)

# Write the results to text.out
with open('text.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{len(words) - len(max_chain)}\n{len(words)}\n")
    for word in max_chain:
        fout.write(f"{word}\n")

In this solution, we first read all words from `text.in` and create a graph (`graph`) where each word is connected to all words that can follow it in the sequence. We then perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find the longest chain of words, starting from each word in the input list. After finding the longest chain (`max_chain`), we calculate the number of words to eliminate and write the output to `text.out`.

By considering full words and their connections, this solution should meet the problem's requirements and produce the correct output as expected.
