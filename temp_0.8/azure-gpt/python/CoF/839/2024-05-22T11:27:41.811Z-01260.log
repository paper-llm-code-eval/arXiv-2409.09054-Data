Ionuţ pleacă în drumeţie într-o porţiune de teren de formă pătratică cu latura de $N$ metri. O hartă a zonei are trasat un caroiaj care împarte zona în $N \cdot N$ pătrate unitate, cu latura de $1$ metru. Astfel harta zonei are aspectul unui tablou pătratic cu $N$ linii şi $N$ coloane. Liniile şi coloanele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $N$. Elementele tabloului bidimensional corespund pătratelor unitate. Zona poate fi parcursă străbătând oricare dintre laturile pătratelor unitate **cel mult o singură dată**.

~[55bdc2f5c84ca3f4b5a80867350d0328.png]

Ionuţ pleacă din punctul aflat în colţul din dreapta jos al pătratului unitate din linia $X$, coloana $Y$ şi se deplasează făcând **un pas** (parcurgând o latură a unui pătrat unitate) în una din direcţiile $Nord$, $Est$, $Sud$, $Vest$. Pentru a reţine mai uşor traseul foloseşte următoarea codificare pentru cele $4$ direcţii: $1$ pentru deplasarea spre $Nord$, $2$ pentru deplasarea spre $Est$, $3$ pentru deplasarea spre $Sud$, respectiv $4$ pentru deplasarea spre $Vest$. Ajuns într-alt punct (colţ de pătrat unitate), Ionuţ continuă să se deplaseze fără a trece de mai multe ori pe aceeaşi latură a unui pătrat unitate. 

Ionuţ se opreşte în momentul în care ajunge într-un punct prin care a mai trecut. Traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct delimitează o zonă de teren formată din pătrate unitate.

# Cerinţă

Dându-se linia $X$ şi coloana $Y$ corespunzătoare poziţiei de plecare a lui Ionuţ, dimensiunea zonei $N$, lungimea traseului $L$ şi traseul determinaţi:

$a)$ Numărul de paşi parcurşi între prima şi a doua trecere prin punctul de oprire.
$b)$ Numărul de pătrate unitate interioare zonei delimitată de traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct.  


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `zona.in` se află valorile $X$, $Y$, $N$ şi $L$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctului de plecare, dimensiunea terenului şi lungimea traseului parcurs. Pe următoarea linie se află $L$ valori din mulţimea $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând codificarea întregului traseu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `zona.out` va conţine **două** linii, pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $a)$, iar pe linia a doua, un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < N < 51$
* $0 < X, Y < N$
* $0 < L < 2501$
* Se garantează faptul că traseul trece de două ori prin acelaşi punct şi nu parcurge de două ori aceeaşi latură.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $a)$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $b)$ se acordă $80\%$ din punctaj.

It seems that my previous solution had several issues. The calculation of the steps between the first and second crossing was incorrect because it didn't account for the correct index. Additionally, the way in which I attempted to calculate the area using the winding number technique is not suitable for this problem.

Let me correct the approach and rewrite the entire solution:

- To find the number of steps between the first and second crossing, I will track the visited points and stop when a point is visited twice.
- To calculate the number of squares within the area delimited by Ionuţ's path, I will fill the area within the loop and then count the number of filled squares.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from "zona.in"
with open('zona.in', 'r') as fin:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    moves = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables
dx = [0, -1, 0, 1, 0]  # North, East, South, West (1-indexed)
dy = [0, 0, 1, 0, -1]
positions = set([(X, Y)])
closed_loop_steps = 0
first_encounter = True

# Traverse the path and find the loop steps and the positions visited
for move in moves:
    X += dx[move]
    Y += dy[move]
    if (X, Y) in positions and first_encounter:
        first_encounter = False
        loop_start_pos = (X, Y)
        loop_positions = [(X, Y)]
    elif not first_encounter:
        loop_positions.append((X, Y))
        if (X, Y) == loop_start_pos:
            break
    else:
        positions.add((X, Y))
    closed_loop_steps += 1

# Calculate the area within the loop
# Create a grid to mark the squares inside the loop
grid = [[False for _ in range(N + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
# We will use a form of flood fill algorithm from the loop start position
# Since we only fill interior squares and Ionuţ never crosses his path, we don't need to check bounds
def fill(x, y):
    if not grid[x][y]:
        grid[x][y] = True
        if (x + 1, y) not in positions: fill(x + 1, y)
        if (x - 1, y) not in positions: fill(x - 1, y)
        if (x, y + 1) not in positions: fill(x, y + 1)
        if (x, y - 1) not in positions: fill(x, y - 1)

# Start the fill from each point on the loop to ensure we fill all internal areas
for pos in loop_positions:
    fill(*pos)

# Count the filled squares to determine the area
area = sum(row.count(True) for row in grid)

# Write the output data to "zona.out"
with open('zona.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{closed_loop_steps}\n{area}\n")
```

This solution addresses the issues and should give the expected output. It writes the number of steps between the first and second crossing to `zona.out` on the first line and the number of squares within the loop on the second line.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's revise the approach to ensure we get the correct output:

1. We will use `visited` to keep track of visited corners and detect when we close the loop.
2. To find the loop steps, we increment a counter until we reach a previously visited corner.
3. We will use a 2D grid to keep track of which square edges have been traversed.
4. To calculate the area, we will fill the grid from the loop start position by moving in all four directions until we hit an already visited edge.

Let's implement this corrected approach:

```python
# Read the input data from "zona.in"
with open('zona.in', 'r') as fin:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    moves = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables
dx = [0, -1, 0, 1, 0]  # North, East, South, West (1-indexed)
dy = [0, 0, 1, 0, -1]
visited = set([(X, Y)])  # Set of visited corners
edges_visited = set()     # Set of visited edges (sides of squares)
loop_steps = 0
inside_area = 0
first_encounter = True

# Traverse the path
for move in moves:
    new_X, new_Y = X + dx[move], Y + dy[move]
    edge = frozenset({(X, Y), (new_X, new_Y)})  # An unordered pair of points representing the edge

    # Detect the closing of the loop
    if edge in edges_visited:
        if first_encounter:
            loop_steps = len(edges_visited)  # The number of steps taken so far
            first_encounter = False
        else:
            break  # We found the second encounter with an edge, so we end the loop

    # Add the edge to the set of visited edges
    edges_visited.add(edge)

    # Update the position
    X, Y = new_X, new_Y

# Determine the area inside the loop
# Use a flood fill algorithm from the loop starting point
def flood_fill(x, y):
    global inside_area
    
    # If this square has already been visited or is out of bounds, return
    if (x <= 0 or x >= N or y <= 0 or y >= N or (x, y) in visited):
        return
    
    # Mark this square as visited
    visited.add((x, y))
    inside_area += 1  # Increase the area
    
    # Visit all adjacent squares
    flood_fill(x + 1, y)
    flood_fill(x - 1, y)
    flood_fill(x, y + 1)
    flood_fill(x, y - 1)

# Loop through all cells, if it's not visited and not on the boundary of the loop, fill it
for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(1, N):
        if (i, j) not in visited and not any(frozenset({(i, j), (ni, nj)}) in edges_visited for ni, nj in [(i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1)]):
            flood_fill(i, j)

# Write the output data to "zona.out"
with open('zona.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{loop_steps}\n{inside_area}\n")
```

This solution should now write the correct number of loop steps and the correct number of squares within the loop to `zona.out`.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's re-evaluate the problem and implement a solution that correctly identifies the number of steps between the first and second crossing, as well as calculates the area enclosed by Ionuţ's path.

We will use a `visited` set to keep track of the corners that Ionuţ has visited. When he visits a corner for the second time, that indicates the loop is closed. To find the number of steps between the first and second crossing, we start counting from the first time we visit a corner until we visit it again.

For the area calculation, we will use a modified version of the shoelace formula. This formula is commonly used to calculate the area of a polygon given its vertices. Normally, Ionuţ's path does not form a simple polygon, but since he never crosses the same edge twice, we can use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the simple polygon that has vertices on the path up to the point where the path first starts to loop.

Let's implement the revised solution:

```python
# Read the input data from "zona.in"
with open('zona.in', 'r') as fin:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    moves = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables
dx = [0, -1, 0, 1, 0]  # North, East, South, West
dy = [0, 0, 1, 0, -1]
visited = {((X, Y)): 0}  # Store index when first visited
path = [(X, Y)]  # Store the path to calculate the area later
area = 0
steps_between = 0

# Traverse the path
for i, move in enumerate(moves):
    X += dx[move]
    Y += dy[move]
    path.append((X, Y))
    
    # Check if this corner has been visited before
    if (X, Y) in visited:
        steps_between = i - visited[(X, Y)]
        break
    else:
        visited[(X, Y)] = i + 1  # i+1 because i starts from 0 but steps start from 1

# Calculate the area enclosed by the path using the Shoelace formula
for i in range(len(path) - 1):
    x1, y1 = path[i]
    x2, y2 = path[i + 1]
    area += (x1 * y2 - x2 * y1)

# The actual area is half the absolute value of the computed area
inside_area = abs(area) // 2

# Write the output data to "zona.out"
with open('zona.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{steps_between}\n{inside_area}\n")
```

This corrected solution should read from `zona.in`, correctly identify the number of steps between the first and second crossing, calculate the area enclosed by Ionuţ's path, and write the results to `zona.out`.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous attempts. Let's reevaluate the problem and come up with a correct solution.

1. To count the steps between the first and second crossing, we will track the visited corners and stop when a corner is revisited.
2. To calculate the number of squares enclosed by the path, we will track the visited horizontal and vertical edges and use them to build the boundary of the area. We will then use a flood fill algorithm starting from the edges of the grid to mark the exterior squares. The interior squares are those not marked during this process.

Let's implement this solution:

```python
# Read the input data from "zona.in"
with open('zona.in', 'r') as fin:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    traseu = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables
directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # N, E, S, W
steps = 0
area = 0
grid = [[0 for _ in range(N + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Function to mark the exterior squares using flood fill
def flood_fill(x, y):
    if x < 0 or x > N or y < 0 or y > N or grid[x][y] != 0:
        return
    grid[x][y] = -1  # Mark as exterior
    for dx, dy in directions:
        flood_fill(x + dx, y + dy)

# Mark the starting point and update the grid for each step
X, Y = N - X, Y - 1  # Transform the coordinates to 0-indexed grid coordinates
start_point = (X, Y)
visited = set([start_point])
grid[X][Y] = 1

for move in traseu:
    dx, dy = directions[move - 1]
    X, Y = X + dx, Y + dy
    steps += 1
    if (X, Y) in visited:
        break
    visited.add((X, Y))
    grid[X][Y] = 1

# Use flood fill to mark the exterior squares starting from the edges of the grid
for i in range(N + 1):
    flood_fill(0, i)
    flood_fill(N, i)
    flood_fill(i, 0)
    flood_fill(i, N)

# Count the number of squares that have not been marked as exterior (these are interior)
for row in grid:
    area += row.count(0)

# Write the output data to "zona.out"
with open('zona.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{steps}\n{area}\n")
```

This algorithm should now correctly calculate both the number of steps between the first and second crossing and the number of squares enclosed by Ionuţ's path. It writes these numbers to `zona.out`.

I will re-evaluate the problem, ensuring that the correct algorithms are used to determine the number of steps between the first and second crossings, as well as accurately calculating the number of enclosed squares in the area delimited by Ionuţ's path.

To fix the issues:

1. The steps should be counted starting from the first move until the move before the position is revisited, which means I will fix the loop condition to correctly identify the loop length.
2. For the area calculation, we will use a 2D boolean grid to mark visited squares and then count the number of squares within the boundary formed by the path up to the first repeated corner.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from "zona.in"
with open('zona.in', 'r') as fin:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    directions = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables
move_dx = {1: -1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0}
move_dy = {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: -1}
visited = set([(X, Y)])
path = [(X, Y)]
double_visit = False

# Apply the moves and find the path taken by Ionuţ
for move in directions:
    X += move_dx[move]
    Y += move_dy[move]
    if (X, Y) in visited:
        double_visit = True
        break
    visited.add((X, Y))
    path.append((X, Y))

# The loop length is the number of moves minus the index of the first repeated position
loop_length = len(path) - 1

# Initialize a grid to mark the visited squares for the area calculation
grid = [[False] * (N + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Mark the squares visited along the path
for x, y in path:
    grid[x][y] = True

# Count the total number of squares within the loop using flood fill
# Start flood fill from the boundary, marking the outer squares
def flood_fill(x, y):
    if 0 <= x <= N and 0 <= y <= N and not grid[x][y]:
        grid[x][y] = True
        flood_fill(x + 1, y)
        flood_fill(x - 1, y)
        flood_fill(x, y + 1)
        flood_fill(x, y - 1)

# Perform flood fill from the edges to mark outer squares
for i in range(N + 1):
    flood_fill(0, i)
    flood_fill(N, i)
    flood_fill(i, 0)
    flood_fill(i, N)

# Count the inner squares not reached by the flood fill (remaining False)
area = sum(row.count(False) for row in grid)

# Write the output data to "zona.out"
with open('zona.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{loop_length}\n{area}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now read the correct number of steps between the first and second crossings and calculate the area enclosed by Ionuţ's path, then write these numbers to `zona.out`.
