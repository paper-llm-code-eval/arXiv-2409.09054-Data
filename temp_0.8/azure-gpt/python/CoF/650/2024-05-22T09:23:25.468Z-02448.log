This Python code defines functions to:
1. Check if the given matrix is already a yin-yang matrix.
2. Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make the matrix yin-yang.
3. Read the input from a file, process it, and write the output to another file.

Please note that for this specific challenge, it assumes that if the rows and columns can be independently sorted in non-decreasing order, then the matrix can be made yin-yang in at most N-1 + M-1 operations. If any of these sorts result in a condition where an element is greater than the element below or to the right, it returns -1, since it's not possible to make the matrix yin-yang.

The process_file function is called at the end with the specified input and output file names.

The initial approach incorrectly asserts that if every row and every column of the matrix can be independently sorted in non-decreasing order, the matrix can be transformed into a yin-yang matrix with at most \(N-1 + M-1\) operations. However, this assertion does not account for the possibility that the same element may need to be moved in both a row swap and a column swap, which could render the transformation impossible.

To fix the logic, we need to understand that for a matrix to be transformed into a yin-yang matrix, the following must be true:

1. The smallest element must be in the top-left corner.
2. The largest element must be in the bottom-right corner.
3. If we have multiple occurrences of the smallest or largest elements, they must be arranged in such a way that it's possible to move them to the top-left or bottom-right corners using the allowed operations.

This approach requires a new strategy, which involves checking the conditions mentioned above and calculating the minimum number of swaps needed to move the smallest and largest elements to their correct positions.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def read_matrix(file):
    N, M = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return N, M, matrix

def write_result(file, result):
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def min_swaps(N, M, matrix):
    # Find the positions of the smallest and largest elements
    min_val = min(map(min, matrix))
    max_val = max(map(max, matrix))
    min_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(M) if matrix[i][j] == min_val]
    max_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(M) if matrix[i][j] == max_val]

    # Calculate the distance of each smallest and largest element to their respective corners
    min_swaps_to_corner = min(i + j for i, j in min_positions)
    max_swaps_to_corner = min((N - 1 - i) + (M - 1 - j) for i, j in max_positions)

    # If the smallest and largest elements overlap in the same cell, add an extra swap
    if (0, 0) in max_positions or (N - 1, M - 1) in min_positions:
        return min_swaps_to_corner + max_swaps_to_corner + 1

    return min_swaps_to_corner + max_swaps_to_corner

# Read the input file, process the data and write the output file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, matrix = read_matrix(file)

min_ops = min_swaps(N, M, matrix)

with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file:
    write_result(file, min_ops)
```
This updated solution finds the smallest and largest values in the matrix and calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to move them to the top-left and bottom-right corners respectively. If the smallest and largest elements are in the same cell, it accounts for an additional swap needed to separate them. This approach should correctly calculate the minimum number of swaps required to transform the given matrix into a yin-yang matrix.

The previously provided solution did not account for the condition that swapping rows or columns should also ensure non-decreasing order in between them. The solution should be able to execute the correct swaps to move elements into their right positions while maintaining the non-decreasing order property. It was incorrectly counting the minimum number of swaps required to bring the largest and smallest elements to the corners without ensuring the rest of the matrix satisfies the yin-yang property.

In this case, we need a different approach to solve the problem correctly. The correct approach involves checking for each element in the matrix whether it can be moved to its correct position by the given operations while maintaining the non-decreasing order.

We need to find the minimum number of swaps needed to sort both the rows and columns of the matrix while considering that some swaps can be done simultaneously during row or column swaps. This process can be much more complex and might require a different algorithmic approach.

Due to the complexity, it's worth noting that a simple greedy or sorting-based algorithm might not suffice, and a more in-depth analysis of the matrix structure and possible sequence of swaps is required.

Here is an attempt at a more sophisticated solution that takes into account the complexity of the problem:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_sorted_after_swap(matrix, rows, cols, swap):
    """Check if the matrix is sorted after a given swap."""
    # Create a copy of the matrix to perform the swap
    new_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]
    if swap[0] == 'r':
        new_matrix[swap[1]], new_matrix[swap[1] + 1] = new_matrix[swap[1] + 1], new_matrix[swap[1]]
    else:
        for r in range(rows):
            new_matrix[r][swap[1]], new_matrix[r][swap[1] + 1] = new_matrix[r][swap[1] + 1], new_matrix[r][swap[1]]

    # Check rows
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(1, cols):
            if new_matrix[r][c] < new_matrix[r][c - 1]:
                return False
    # Check columns
    for c in range(cols):
        for r in range(1, rows):
            if new_matrix[r][c] < new_matrix[r - 1][c]:
                return False
    return True

def min_swaps(matrix, rows, cols):
    """Count the minimum number of swaps to sort the matrix."""
    # Generate all possible swaps
    possible_swaps = [('r', i) for i in range(rows - 1)] + [('c', i) for i in range(cols - 1)]

    for num_swaps in range(len(possible_swaps) + 1):
        # Test all combinations of `num_swaps` swaps
        for swap_comb in permutations(possible_swaps, num_swaps):
            sorted_after_swaps = True
            for swap in swap_comb:
                if not is_sorted_after_swap(matrix, rows, cols, swap):
                    sorted_after_swaps = False
                    break
            if sorted_after_swaps:
                return num_swaps
    return -1

# Read the input file, process the data and write the output file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file:
    rows, cols = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(rows)]

min_ops = min_swaps(matrix, rows, cols)

with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_ops) + '\n')
```

This solution attempts to brute-force the problem by checking all possible combinations of swaps up to the total number of possible swaps. The `is_sorted_after_swap` function checks if the matrix is yin-yang sorted after each swap. If we can achieve a sorted matrix with a certain number of swaps, we return that number as the result. If no combination of swaps results in a yin-yang sorted matrix, we return -1. 

Please note that this approach has a factorial time complexity and may not be feasible for larger matrix sizes. However, for smaller sizes within the provided constraints, it could still provide a correct solution.

The previous attempts at solving the challenge were incorrect due to either misunderstanding the problem requirements or applying an incorrect algorithm. After reconsidering the problem, the correct solution must ensure the following conditions for a yin-yang matrix:

1. Each row and column must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. Swapping operations can only be performed between two consecutive rows or two consecutive columns.

Given these constraints, the problem is still complex to solve optimally due to the potential large number of permutations. However, a heuristic approach can be applied for smaller matrices, or a more advanced algorithm may be necessary for larger matrices.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to apply an algorithm that can determine if there is a sequence of swaps that can result in a yin-yang matrix. This typically involves a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with optimizations to explore the space of possible swaps.

Here is an optimized solution that attempts to find the right sequence of swaps using BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

# Helper function to swap rows or columns
def swap(matrix, x, is_row):
    new_matrix = [list(row) for row in matrix]  # Make a copy of the matrix
    if is_row:
        new_matrix[x], new_matrix[x + 1] = new_matrix[x + 1], new_matrix[x]
    else:
        for row in new_matrix:
            row[x], row[x + 1] = row[x + 1], row[x]
    return new_matrix

# Check if matrix is a yin-yang matrix
def check_yin_yang(matrix):
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(1, len(matrix[i])):
            if matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j - 1]:
                return False
    for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
        for i in range(1, len(matrix)):
            if matrix[i][j] < matrix[i - 1][j]:
                return False
    return True

# Find the minimum number of moves to reach a yin-yang matrix
def min_moves(matrix):
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(matrix, 0)])
    while queue:
        current_matrix, moves = queue.popleft()
        matrix_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in current_matrix)
        if matrix_tuple in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(matrix_tuple)
        if check_yin_yang(current_matrix):
            return moves
        for x in range(rows - 1):
            swapped_matrix = swap(current_matrix, x, True)
            queue.append((swapped_matrix, moves + 1))
        for x in range(cols - 1):
            swapped_matrix = swap(current_matrix, x, False)
            queue.append((swapped_matrix, moves + 1))
    return -1

# Read input, process data, and write output
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N)]

min_ops = min_moves(matrix)

with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{min_ops}\n")
```

This solution employs a BFS approach to explore the space of matrix permutations resulting from row and column swaps. It keeps track of visited matrices to avoid redundant checks and uses a queue to explore possible moves level-by-level. The algorithm checks each matrix state to see if it is a yin-yang matrix, and if it is, it returns the number of moves taken to reach that state. If after exploring all possibilities no yin-yang matrix is found, it returns -1.

Please note that while the BFS approach is more likely to find an optimal solution than previous attempts, it can still be inefficient for very large matrices due to the potentially high branching factor. However, for the size constraints given in the problem (up to 100x100), this solution should work adequately, assuming that the number of unique matrix states doesn't explode to intractable levels.
