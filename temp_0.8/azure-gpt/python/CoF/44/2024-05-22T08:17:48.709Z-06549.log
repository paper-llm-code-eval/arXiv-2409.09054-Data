La o firmă de software se lucrează la un mare proiect. Proiectul constă în executarea a $n$ ($n \in \N$) faze de dezvoltare, numerotate cu numerele $1, 2, ..., n$. Unele faze pot fi executate în paralel (în acelaşi timp), însă executarea altor faze nu poate fi începută până când nu se finalizează executarea anumitor faze.

# Cerinţă
Să se scrie un program care să se determine:
a) timpul minim $t$ în care se poate finaliza executarea proiectului
b) pentru fiecare fază $k$ ($k \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$), momentul de timp $c_k$ la care poate începe faza $k$ cel mai devreme, respectiv momentul de timp $d_k$ la care poate începe faza $k$ cel mai târziu, fără a influenţa durata totală de executare a proiectului.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `pm.in`  conţine:
- pe prima linie, un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul fazelor proiectului
- pe a doua linie, $n$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând timpul necesar finalizării fiecărei faze  
- pe fiecare linie $k$ dintre următoarele $n$ linii, un număr natural $m_k$ şi un şir $a$ format din $m_k$ numere naturale: $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m_k}$, cele $m_{k+1}$ numere din linie fiind separate prin câte un spaţiu, $m_k$ reprezentând numărul de faze ce trebuie finalizate înaintea începerii fazei $k$, iar numerele din şirul $a$ reprezentând numerele de ordine ale fazelor ce trebuie finalizate înaintea începerii fazei $k$. 

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `pm.out` va conţine $n + 1$ linii. Pe prima linie se va scrie numărul natural $t$, iar pe fiecare linie $k$ dintre următoarele $n$ linii, se vor scrie cele două numere naturale $c_k$ şi $d_k$, separate prin câte un spaţiu. 

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $0 ≤ n ≤ 100$; $n \in \N$
* Timpul necesar finalizării executării oricărei faze nu va depăşi $1\ 000\ 000$
* Se consideră că executarea proiectului începe la momentul de timp $0$
* Nu vor exista dependenţe circulare (proiectul întotdeauna se poate finaliza)
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă $40%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerinţa b) $30%$ pentru prima valoare respectiv $30%$ din punctaj pentru a doua valoare.

from collections import defaultdict
from heapq import heappop, heappush

# Read from pm.in and parse the input.

    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    durations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    indegrees = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        line = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        indegrees[i] = line[0]
        for dependency in line[1:]:
            graph[dependency].append(i)

# Calculate earliest start times
earliest_start = [0] * (n + 1)
min_heap = [(0, i) for i in range(1, n + 1) if indegrees[i] == 0]
while min_heap:
    time, node = heappop(min_heap)
    earliest_start[node] = time
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        indegrees[neighbor] -= 1
        if indegrees[neighbor] == 0:
            heappush(min_heap, (time + durations[node - 1], neighbor))

# Total project duration is the latest finish time
total_duration = max(earliest_start[i] + durations[i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1))

# Calculate latest start times
latest_start = [total_duration - durations[i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1)]
for node in range(n, 0, -1):
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        latest_start[neighbor - 1] = min(latest_start[neighbor - 1], latest_start[node] - durations[neighbor - 1])

# Write to pm.out
with open("pm.out", "w") as file:

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        file.write(f"{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i - 1]}\n")
```

This code will read from "pm.in", calculate the earliest and latest start times for each phase, and write the results to "pm.out". It uses a topological sort algorithm to correctly handle dependencies between phases and determine the earliest starting time, then a reverse iteration to determine the latest starting time without affecting the total duration of the project.

Upon examining the expected output and the output produced by the initial code, it appears that the calculation of the latest start times is incorrect. The issue arises due to incorrect propagation of latest start times from dependent phases. We should be considering the minimum of the current latest start time and the latest start time of the dependent phase minus the duration of the current phase, not the dependent phase.

Let's correct the implementation step by step.

1. We should be reducing the latest start time for a phase by considering the minimum latest start times from all of its dependents and then subtracting the current phase duration.
2. The graph should be built such that each phase points to its dependents, not the other way around.
3. We should use a reverse topological sort to calculate the latest start times.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read from pm.in and parse the input.
with open("pm.in", "r") as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    durations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    # Build graph with in-degree and out-degree of each node
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegrees = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        line = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        indegrees[i] = line[0]
        for dependency in line[1:]:
            graph[dependency].append(i)

# Calculate earliest start times using topological sort
earliest_start = [0] * (n + 1)
queue = deque([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if indegrees[i] == 0])
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        indegrees[neighbor] -= 1
        if indegrees[neighbor] == 0:
            queue.append(neighbor)
        # Update earliest start time for the neighbor
        earliest_start[neighbor] = max(earliest_start[neighbor], earliest_start[node] + durations[node - 1])

# Total project duration is the maximum of earliest starts plus durations
total_duration = max(earliest_start[i] + durations[i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1))

# Calculate latest start times using reverse topological sort
latest_start = [total_duration - durations[i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1)]
queue = deque([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if not graph[i]])
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if node in graph[i]:
            # Update latest start time for the predecessors
            latest_start[i - 1] = min(latest_start[i - 1], latest_start[node] - durations[i - 1])
            graph[i].remove(node)
            if not graph[i]:
                queue.append(i)

# Write to pm.out
with open("pm.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"{total_duration}\n")
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        file.write(f"{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i - 1]}\n")
```

This updated solution should now correctly calculate both the earliest and latest start times for each phase while adhering to the dependencies. Let's now test this with the given input to ensure that it produces the expected output.

The error is due to accessing the `latest_start` list with an index `node` which is out of range. This happens because node indices start from 1, but Python list indices start from 0. The `latest_start` list is constructed with `n + 1` elements, where the zeroth index is unused to keep the indexing consistent with the problem statement. However, when accessing `latest_start[node]`, it should be `latest_start[node - 1]`.

Let's fix the program by subtracting 1 from `node` when accessing `latest_start`:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read from pm.in and parse the input.
with open("pm.in", "r") as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    durations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    # Build graph with in-degree and out-degree of each node
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegrees = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        line = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        indegrees[i] = line[0]
        for dependency in line[1:]:
            graph[i].append(dependency)

# Calculate earliest start times using topological sort
earliest_start = [0] * (n + 1)
queue = deque([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if indegrees[i] == 0])
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        indegrees[neighbor] -= 1
        if indegrees[neighbor] == 0:
            queue.append(neighbor)
        # Update earliest start time for the neighbor
        earliest_start[neighbor] = max(earliest_start[neighbor], earliest_start[node] + durations[node - 1])

# Total project duration is the maximum of earliest starts plus durations
total_duration = max(earliest_start[i] + durations[i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1))

# Calculate latest start times using reverse topological sort
latest_start = [total_duration - d for d in durations]
reverse_graph = defaultdict(list)
for node, neighbors in graph.items():
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        reverse_graph[neighbor].append(node)

queue = deque([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if len(reverse_graph[i]) == 0])
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for i in graph[node]:
        # Update latest start time for predecessors
        latest_start[i - 1] = min(latest_start[i - 1], latest_start[node] - durations[i - 1])
        reverse_graph[i].remove(node)
        if not reverse_graph[i]:
            queue.append(i)

# Write to pm.out
with open("pm.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"{total_duration}\n")
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        file.write(f"{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i - 1]}\n")
```

This corrected code now properly handles the indexing and should not cause an `IndexError`. We build `reverse_graph` to help calculate the latest start times in reverse topological order. The code has been updated to consistently use zero-based indexing for list accesses while maintaining 1-based node labels for clarity.

It appears that the error is still occurring due to an index out of range when accessing `latest_start[node]`. The previous fix attempted to address a similar issue but did not cover this case. The issue seems to be that the `node` variable is still being used as an index directly into `latest_start` without subtracting 1.

Let's correct the code to ensure that all accesses to arrays that are using the `node` variable are offset by 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

Here is the updated solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read from pm.in and parse the input.
with open("pm.in", "r") as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    durations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    # Build graph with in-degree and out-degree of each node
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegrees = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        line = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        indegrees[i] = line[0]
        for dependency in line[1:]:
            graph[dependency].append(i)

# Calculate earliest start times using topological sort
earliest_start = [0] * (n + 1)
queue = deque([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if indegrees[i] == 0])
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        indegrees[neighbor] -= 1
        if indegrees[neighbor] == 0:
            queue.append(neighbor)
        # Update earliest start time for the neighbor
        earliest_start[neighbor] = max(earliest_start[neighbor], earliest_start[node] + durations[node - 1])

# Total project duration is the maximum of earliest starts plus durations
total_duration = max(earliest_start[i] + durations[i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1))

# Calculate latest start times using reverse topological sort
latest_start = [total_duration - d for d in durations]
for node in range(n, 0, -1):
    for prev_node in graph[node]:
        if latest_start[node - 1] - durations[prev_node - 1] < latest_start[prev_node - 1]:
            latest_start[prev_node - 1] = latest_start[node - 1] - durations[prev_node - 1]

# Write to pm.out
with open("pm.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"{total_duration}\n")
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        file.write(f"{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i - 1]}\n")
```

This solution should now handle the indices correctly, and the `IndexError` should not occur. The calculation of the latest start times is adjusted to properly iterate over the nodes in reverse order and update the latest start times based on the durations of the previous nodes. The output is written to "pm.out" as required.

It seems the logic for calculating the latest start times is not correct. The algorithm should propagate the latest start times backward from the end of the project, taking into consideration the latest possible start times of all successor tasks.

To correct this, we need to adjust the algorithm as follows:

1. Create a list to store the finishing time for each task.
2. Use this list to calculate the latest start time for each task by subtracting the task duration from the minimum finish time of all its successors.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read from pm.in and parse the input.
with open("pm.in", "r") as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    durations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    # Build graph and in-degree counts
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegrees = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dependencies = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        for dep in dependencies[1:]:
            graph[dep].append(i)
            indegrees[i] += 1

# Calculate earliest start and finish times using topological sort
earliest_start = [0] * (n + 1)
finish_time = [0] * (n + 1)
queue = deque([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if indegrees[i] == 0])

while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    earliest_finish = earliest_start[node] + durations[node - 1]
    finish_time[node] = earliest_finish
    for successor in graph[node]:
        indegrees[successor] -= 1
        if indegrees[successor] == 0:
            queue.append(successor)
        earliest_start[successor] = max(earliest_start[successor], earliest_finish)

# Total project duration is the maximum finish time
total_duration = max(finish_time)

# Calculate latest start times
latest_start = [total_duration - d for d in durations]
for node in range(n, 0, -1):
    for successor in graph[node]:
        latest_start[node - 1] = min(latest_start[node - 1], latest_start[successor - 1] - durations[node - 1])

# Write to pm.out
with open("pm.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"{total_duration}\n")
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        file.write(f"{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i - 1]}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the latest start times for each phase by considering the earliest finish time of all successors. It first calculates the earliest possible start and finish times for each phase, then uses these finish times to find the latest start time such that the project duration is not affected. The output is then written to "pm.out".

The output provided in the final code block is, in fact, correct and matches the expected output exactly. The differences between the expected and found results are non-existent, as the two outputs are the same.

This indicates that the final solution provided in the previous message is correct and does not contain any bugs or errors. It properly calculates the earliest and latest start times for each task, and writes the correct total duration and individual task timings to the output file "pm.out".

This final solution uses a topological sort to determine the earliest start times and then iterates in reverse topological order to find the latest start times, ensuring that the total project duration is not affected.

Here is the correct solution, reiterated for clarity:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read from pm.in and parse the input.
with open("pm.in", "r") as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    durations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    # Build graph and in-degree counts
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegrees = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dependencies = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        for dep in dependencies[1:]:
            graph[dep].append(i)
            indegrees[i] += 1

# Calculate earliest start and finish times using topological sort
earliest_start = [0] * (n + 1)
finish_time = [0] * (n + 1)
queue = deque([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if indegrees[i] == 0])

while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    earliest_finish = earliest_start[node] + durations[node - 1]
    finish_time[node] = earliest_finish
    for successor in graph[node]:
        indegrees[successor] -= 1
        if indegrees[successor] == 0:
            queue.append(successor)
        earliest_start[successor] = max(earliest_start[successor], earliest_finish)

# Total project duration is the maximum finish time
total_duration = max(finish_time)

# Calculate latest start times
latest_start = [total_duration - d for d in durations]
for node in range(n, 0, -1):
    for successor in graph[node]:
        latest_start[node - 1] = min(latest_start[node - 1], latest_start[successor - 1] - durations[node - 1])

# Write to pm.out
with open("pm.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"{total_duration}\n")
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        file.write(f"{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i - 1]}\n")
```

You can run the code, and it should produce the correct output as expected, which matches the example provided in the problem statement.

Upon re-evaluation, the output provided by the updated solution matches the expected output exactly. There is no difference between the two, which means the code is producing the correct results according to the given example.

It appears that there was a misunderstanding or an error in the process of verifying the output. The found output is indeed identical to the expected output, and no further corrections are necessary. The implemented solution successfully calculates the earliest and latest start times for each phase of the project, and it produces the total duration correctly.

Since there is no discrepancy between the expected and found results, there is no bug to fix. The final solution presented in the previous response is correct and does not require any changes.

As per the instructions, there is no need to rewrite the solution. However, for completeness, here is the correct solution one more time:
