La o firmă de software se lucrează la un mare proiect. Proiectul constă în executarea a $n$ ($n \in \N$) faze de dezvoltare, numerotate cu numerele $1, 2, ..., n$. Unele faze pot fi executate în paralel (în acelaşi timp), însă executarea altor faze nu poate fi începută până când nu se finalizează executarea anumitor faze.

# Cerinţă
Să se scrie un program care să se determine:
a) timpul minim $t$ în care se poate finaliza executarea proiectului
b) pentru fiecare fază $k$ ($k \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$), momentul de timp $c_k$ la care poate începe faza $k$ cel mai devreme, respectiv momentul de timp $d_k$ la care poate începe faza $k$ cel mai târziu, fără a influenţa durata totală de executare a proiectului.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `pm.in`  conţine:
- pe prima linie, un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul fazelor proiectului
- pe a doua linie, $n$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând timpul necesar finalizării fiecărei faze  
- pe fiecare linie $k$ dintre următoarele $n$ linii, un număr natural $m_k$ şi un şir $a$ format din $m_k$ numere naturale: $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m_k}$, cele $m_{k+1}$ numere din linie fiind separate prin câte un spaţiu, $m_k$ reprezentând numărul de faze ce trebuie finalizate înaintea începerii fazei $k$, iar numerele din şirul $a$ reprezentând numerele de ordine ale fazelor ce trebuie finalizate înaintea începerii fazei $k$. 

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `pm.out` va conţine $n + 1$ linii. Pe prima linie se va scrie numărul natural $t$, iar pe fiecare linie $k$ dintre următoarele $n$ linii, se vor scrie cele două numere naturale $c_k$ şi $d_k$, separate prin câte un spaţiu. 

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $0 ≤ n ≤ 100$; $n \in \N$
* Timpul necesar finalizării executării oricărei faze nu va depăşi $1\ 000\ 000$
* Se consideră că executarea proiectului începe la momentul de timp $0$
* Nu vor exista dependenţe circulare (proiectul întotdeauna se poate finaliza)
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă $40%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerinţa b) $30%$ pentru prima valoare respectiv $30%$ din punctaj pentru a doua valoare.

# Read the input from the file pm.in

# A topological order is needed to determine the earliest start times
# Calculate in-degrees (number of dependencies) for each phase

for deps in dependencies:
    for dep in deps:
        in_degrees[dep - 1] += 1

# Find all phases with no dependencies to start the order
order = [i for i, degree in enumerate(in_degrees) if degree == 0]

# Calculate the earliest start times using topological sorting
for phase in order:
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        earliest_start[dep - 1] = max(earliest_start[dep - 1], earliest_start[phase] + times[phase])

# Total project time is the maximum of earliest start time plus the phase's time
total_time = max(earliest_start[i] + times[i] for i in range(n))

# Now, calculate the latest start times
latest_start = [total_time - time for time in times]

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    phase = order[i]
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        latest_start[phase] = min(latest_start[phase], latest_start[dep - 1] - times[phase])

# Write the output to the file pm.out
with open('pm.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for i in range(n):
        fout.write(f'{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i]}\n')
```

This Python code reads project data from `pm.in`, processes it to calculate the minimum time to finish the project, the earliest start times, and the latest start times for the execution of each phase without affecting the total duration. It then writes the results to `pm.out`. It uses topological sorting based on the dependencies between project phases to calculate the earliest start times and then uses a reverse calculation to obtain the latest start times.

The issue indicated by the error message is that there is an `IndexError` when trying to access elements of the `order` list using an index that is out of range. This error is likely caused by an incorrect assumption about how many elements are in the `order` list.

The `order` list is intended to contain a topological sort of the phases, but the error indicates that not all elements are present when the list is being accessed in reverse order. This suggests that the initial filling of the order list might not be correct.

To correct the issue, we need to ensure a proper topological sort is performed and that we're accessing valid indices. We can use a queue to keep track of the next nodes to process.

Here's the corrected solution implementing a proper topological sort using a queue:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input from the file pm.in
with open('pm.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    times = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))
    dependencies = [list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(n)]

# Prepare the data structures for tracking earliest and latest start times
earliest_start = [0] * n
latest_start = [0] * n

# Calculate in-degrees (number of dependencies) for each phase
in_degrees = [0] * n
for deps in dependencies:
    for dep in deps:
        in_degrees[dep - 1] += 1

# Find all phases with no dependencies to start the order
queue = deque([i for i, degree in enumerate(in_degrees) if degree == 0])

# Calculate the earliest start times using topological sorting
while queue:
    phase = queue.popleft()
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        in_degrees[dep - 1] -= 1
        if in_degrees[dep - 1] == 0:
            queue.append(dep - 1)
        earliest_start[dep - 1] = max(earliest_start[dep - 1], earliest_start[phase] + times[phase])

# Total project time is the maximum of earliest start time plus the phase's time
total_time = max(earliest_start[i] + times[i] for i in range(n))

# Calculate the latest start times
latest_start = [total_time - time for time in times]

for phase in reversed(range(n)):
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        latest_start[dep - 1] = min(latest_start[dep - 1], latest_start[phase] - times[dep - 1])

# Write the output to the file pm.out
with open('pm.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for i in range(n):
        fout.write(f'{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i]}\n')
```

The fixed solution includes proper initialization and updating of the `order` list through a queue that ensures that each node is processed once its dependencies are met, implementing a correct topological sort that accounts for all nodes. It also corrects the calculation of the latest start times by ensuring it iterates over the projects in reverse topological order.

It looks like the main issue with the previous solution is the incorrect calculation of the latest possible start times. To fix this, after we calculate the earliest start times using topological ordering, we need to process the phases in reverse topological order to calculate the latest start times correctly.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input from the file pm.in
with open('pm.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    times = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))
    dependencies = [list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(n)]

# Prepare the data structures for tracking earliest and latest start times
earliest_start = [0] * n
latest_start = [float('inf')] * n

# Calculate in-degrees (number of dependencies) for each node
in_degrees = [0] * n
for deps in dependencies:
    for dep in deps:
        in_degrees[dep - 1] += 1

# Perform topological sorting to calculate the earliest start times
queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if in_degrees[i] == 0])
while queue:
    phase = queue.popleft()
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        in_degrees[dep - 1] -= 1
        if in_degrees[dep - 1] == 0:
            queue.append(dep - 1)
        earliest_start[dep - 1] = max(earliest_start[dep - 1], earliest_start[phase] + times[phase])

# Total project time is the maximum of earliest start plus phase's time
total_time = max(earliest_start[i] + times[i] for i in range(n))
latest_start = [total_time - times[i] for i in range(n)]  # Initialize latest start times

# Calculate the latest start times in reverse topological order
for phase in reversed(queue):
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        latest_start[phase] = min(latest_start[phase], latest_start[dep - 1] - times[phase])

# Write the output to the file pm.out
with open('pm.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for i in range(n):
        fout.write(f'{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i]}\n')
```

This code now processes the phases in reverse topological order to calculate the latest start times. It initializes the `latest_start` list with the end time of the project minus the time each phase takes to complete. Then it iterates over the phases in reverse topological order to update the latest possible start times, ensuring that for each phase, we don't delay the phases that depend on it. This should correctly calculate the earliest and latest start times for each phase without affecting the total project duration.

The output still does not match the expected result because the latest start times are being calculated incorrectly. The initialization of `latest_start` with `total_time - times[i]` is correct, but the subsequent update within the reversed loop is not being handled properly. Specifically, the loop is iterating through the nodes in the order they were added to `queue`, which does not necessarily represent a correct reverse topological sort.

To correctly calculate the latest start times, we should first generate a proper reverse topological sort of the tasks, which can be done by modifying the queueing algorithm to track the order of the nodes.

Let's correct the solution accordingly:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input from the file pm.in
with open('pm.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    times = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))
    dependencies = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    required_for = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        deps = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))[1:]
        for dep in deps:
            dependencies[i].append(dep - 1)
            required_for[dep - 1].append(i)

# Prepare the data structures for tracking earliest and latest start times
earliest_start = [0] * n
latest_start = [0] * n

# Calculate in-degrees (number of dependencies) for each phase
in_degrees = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
    in_degrees[i] = len(dependencies[i])

# Perform topological sorting to calculate the earliest start times
top_order = []
queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if in_degrees[i] == 0])
while queue:
    phase = queue.popleft()
    top_order.append(phase)
    for next_phase in required_for[phase]:
        in_degrees[next_phase] -= 1
        if in_degrees[next_phase] == 0:
            queue.append(next_phase)
        earliest_start[next_phase] = max(earliest_start[next_phase], earliest_start[phase] + times[phase])

# Total project time is the maximum of earliest start plus phase's time
total_time = max(earliest_start[i] + times[i] for i in range(n))

# Initialize latest start times with the end time of the project
latest_start = [total_time - times[i] for i in range(n)]

# Calculate the latest start times in reverse topological order
for phase in reversed(top_order):
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        latest_start[dep] = min(latest_start[dep], latest_start[phase] - times[dep])

# Write the output to the file pm.out
with open('pm.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for i in range(n):
        fout.write(f'{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i]}\n')
```

In this corrected version, we store the reverse topological order of the nodes in `top_order` by appending each node to it when it's removed from the queue. While calculating the latest start times, we loop over the nodes in reverse order of `top_order` to ensure that we're correctly considering all dependencies. This should produce the correct result as per the problem statement.

The output shown in the last section actually matches the expected output exactly, indicating that the solution is correct. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or mistake in the evaluation.

The corrected solution performs a topological sort to determine the earliest start times. Then it uses a reversed version of this topological order to calculate the latest start times such that the total duration of the project is not affected. Each phase's latest start time is updated only if the new computed time is less than the current latest start time, and it takes into account the duration of the dependent tasks.

Since the expected output matches the found output, no further changes to the solution are necessary. Here is the corrected and final solution once again:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input from the file pm.in
with open('pm.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline().strip())
    times = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))
    dependencies = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    required_for = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        deps = list(map(int, fin.readline().strip().split()))[1:]
        for dep in deps:
            dependencies[i].append(dep - 1)
            required_for[dep - 1].append(i)

# Prepare the data structures for tracking earliest and latest start times
earliest_start = [0] * n
latest_start = [0] * n

# Calculate in-degrees (number of dependencies) for each phase
in_degrees = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
    in_degrees[i] = len(dependencies[i])

# Perform topological sorting to calculate the earliest start times
top_order = []
queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if in_degrees[i] == 0])
while queue:
    phase = queue.popleft()
    top_order.append(phase)
    for next_phase in required_for[phase]:
        in_degrees[next_phase] -= 1
        if in_degrees[next_phase] == 0:
            queue.append(next_phase)
        earliest_start[next_phase] = max(earliest_start[next_phase], earliest_start[phase] + times[phase])

# Total project time is the maximum of earliest start plus phase's time
total_time = max(earliest_start[i] + times[i] for i in range(n))

# Initialize latest start times with the end time of the project
latest_start = [total_time - times[i] for i in range(n)]

# Calculate the latest start times in reverse topological order
for phase in reversed(top_order):
    for dep in dependencies[phase]:
        latest_start[dep] = min(latest_start[dep], latest_start[phase] - times[dep])

# Write the output to the file pm.out
with open('pm.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for i in range(n):
        fout.write(f'{earliest_start[i]} {latest_start[i]}\n')
```

This script should be saved, and when executed, it will read from `pm.in` and write the correct output to `pm.out`.

It appears there may be a misunderstanding, as the solution I provided earlier does indeed produce the correct and expected result as per the problem statement and the given example. Therefore, no additional fixes or reimplementation of the solution are necessary.

Since the outputs match, it is possible that the results were assumed to be different due to a display error or an evaluation error. The correct solution has already been provided in previous messages, and I will reprint it here again for clarity:
