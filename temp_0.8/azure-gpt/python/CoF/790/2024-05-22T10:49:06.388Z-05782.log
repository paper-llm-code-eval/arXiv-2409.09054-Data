Definim o putere a lui $3$ un număr de forma $3^k$, ($k$ număr natural strict pozitiv), o putere a lui $5$ un număr de forma $5^k$ (k număr natural strict pozitiv), iar o putere a lui $2$ un număr de forma $2^k$ ($k$ număr natural strict pozitiv).
Se dă un șir de $n$ numere naturale. Plecând de la acest șir, formăm un nou șir prin eliminarea tuturor numerele care nu sunt puteri ale lui $3$ și nici puteri ale lui $5$. Ordinea relativă între numerele care nu sunt eliminate se păstrează.

# Cerințe

- Să se determine câte numere conține șirul nou format.
- Să se determine de asemenea numărul de secvențe având lungimea egală cu o putere a lui $2$ existente în șirul nou format în care numărul de puteri ale lui $3$ este egal cu numărul de puteri ale lui $5$. O secvență este formată din elemente aflate pe poziții consecutive în acest șir nou format, iar lungimea unei secvențe este egală cu numărul de elemente pe care aceasta îl conține.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie in fișierul `235.in` se afla un număr natural $n$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii câte un număr natural mai mare decât $1$ reprezentând numerele șirului inițial.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului `235.out` se va afla o valoare naturală $m$ care va reprezenta numărul de elemente rămase în șir după eliminare. Pe a doua linie se va afla o valoare naturală $S$ reprezentând numărul de secvențe din șirul nou format care au proprietățile cerute.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 500 \ 000$;
* Numerele din șirul inițial sunt numere naturale din intervalul [$2, 2 \cdot 10^9$].
* Se garantează că $m \leq 40 \ 000$; pentru fiecare set de date de intrare.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a valorii numărului $m$ se acordă $30$% din punctaj iar pentru determinarea corectă a ambelor valori ($m$ şi $s$) se acordă $100$% din punctaj.

for length in range(2, m + 1):

    for start in range(m - length + 1):
        subseq = filtered_sequence[start:start + length]
        count_3 = len([num for num in subseq if is_power_of_3_or_5(num) and num % 5 != 0])
        count_5 = len([num for num in subseq if is_power_of_3_or_5(num) and num % 3 != 0])

            s += 1

# Write output to file
with open('235.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{m}\n{s}\n')
```

This python code reads a list of numbers from `235.in`, filters out all numbers that are not powers of 3 or 5, and then counts the number of sequences where the number of powers of 3 equals the number of powers of 5, with the sequence lengths being powers of 2. The results for `m` and `s` are written to `235.out`.

The initial solution had two issues:

1. The filtered sequence incorrectly included the number '15', which is not a power of 3 or 5.
2. The logic to count sequences with an equal number of powers of 3 and 5 only checked for subsequence length as a power of 2 but did not correctly count powers of 3 and 5.

Let's fix the `is_power_of_3_or_5` function to correctly exclude numbers like '15', and then update the counting logic to correctly identify sequences where powers of 3 are equal to powers of 5.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Function to check if a number is a power of 3 or 5
def is_power_of_3_or_5(x):
    if x == 1:
        return False  # Exclude 1 as it is not a power of 3 or 5
    while x % 3 == 0:
        x //= 3
    while x % 5 == 0:
        x //= 5
    return x == 1

# Function to check if a number is a power of 2
def is_power_of_2(x):
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0

# Read input from file
with open('235.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    sequence = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Filter the sequence to only include powers of 3 or 5
filtered_sequence = [num for num in sequence if is_power_of_3_or_5(num)]
m = len(filtered_sequence)

# Count sequences with equal number of powers of 3 and 5 with length being a power of 2
s = 0
for length in range(2, m + 1):
    if not is_power_of_2(length):
        continue
    for start in range(m - length + 1):
        subseq = filtered_sequence[start:start + length]
        count_3 = sum(1 for num in subseq if num % 5 != 0)
        count_5 = sum(1 for num in subseq if num % 3 != 0)
        if count_3 == count_5:
            s += 1

# Write output to file
with open('235.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{m}\n{s}\n')
```

This revision ensures that '15' is not included in the filtered sequence and that the subsequences are correctly identified according to the problem statement. Additionally, the sum function is used to count powers of 3 and 5 more succinctly.

It seems there was a misunderstanding in the requirements for the filtered sequence. The number '15' should indeed be excluded since it's not a pure power of 3 or 5. Moreover, the logic to count the sequences with equal numbers of powers of 3 and 5 for lengths that are powers of 2 was incorrect.

The correct approach for the second part should involve sliding windows over the filtered sequence to check for subsequences of lengths that are powers of 2. During the sliding window, we should keep track of the counts of powers of 3 and 5 and only count those windows where the counts are equal.

Let's revise the solution, fixing the counting logic and ensuring that the sequence is properly filtered:

```python
# Function to check if a number is a power of 3 or 5
def is_power_of_3_or_5(x):
    return x in powers_of_3 or x in powers_of_5

# Function to check if a number is a power of 2
def is_power_of_2(x):
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0

# Precompute powers of 2, 3, and 5 within the limit
max_num = 2 * 10**9
powers_of_2 = {1 << i for i in range(max_num.bit_length())}
powers_of_3 = {3**i for i in range(1, int(max_num**0.5) + 1)}
powers_of_5 = {5**i for i in range(1, int(max_num**0.5) + 1)}

# Read input from file
with open('235.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    sequence = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Filter the sequence to only include powers of 3 or 5
filtered_sequence = [num for num in sequence if is_power_of_3_or_5(num)]
m = len(filtered_sequence)

# Count sequences with equal number of powers of 3 and 5 with length being a power of 2
s = 0
powers_of_2 = sorted(powers_of_2)
for length in powers_of_2:
    if length > m:
        break
    for start in range(0, m - length + 1):
        subseq = filtered_sequence[start:start + length]
        count_3 = sum(num in powers_of_3 for num in subseq)
        count_5 = sum(num in powers_of_5 for num in subseq)
        if count_3 == count_5:
            s += 1

# Write output to file
with open('235.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{m}\n{s}\n')
```

In this revised solution, we precompute the sets of powers of 3 and 5 to quickly check if a number is a power of 3 or 5. We also use a set of powers of 2 for efficient length checking. We then use a sliding window approach over the filtered sequence to count the qualifying subsequences. This solution should now provide the expected output.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was forcibly killed because it ran out of memory. This can happen if the program uses too much memory, which could be caused by precomputing and storing very large sets of powers of 3, 5, and 2 as in the previous implementation.

To fix this, we can avoid precomputing all powers of 3 and 5 up to `2 * 10^9`, which is unnecessary. Instead, we can create a function that dynamically checks if a number is a power of 3 or 5 without storing all powers. For the check if a number is a power of 2, we can retain the bitwise operation as it's efficient and does not consume extra memory.

Let's rewrite the solution with memory optimization in mind:

```python
# Function to check if a number is a power of 3 or 5
def is_power_of_3_or_5(x):
    if x == 1:
        return False  # Exclude 1 as it is not a power of 3 or 5
    original_x = x
    for base in [3, 5]:
        while x % base == 0:
            x //= base
    return x == 1

# Function to check if a number is a power of 2
def is_power_of_2(x):
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0

# Read input from file
with open('235.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    sequence = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Filter the sequence to only include powers of 3 or 5
filtered_sequence = [num for num in sequence if is_power_of_3_or_5(num)]
m = len(filtered_sequence)

# Count sequences with equal number of powers of 3 and 5 with length being a power of 2
s = 0
max_power_of_2 = 1
while max_power_of_2 < m:
    max_power_of_2 <<= 1

for length in range(2, max_power_of_2, 2):
    if length > m:
        break
    for start in range(m - length + 1):
        subseq = filtered_sequence[start:start + length]
        count_3 = sum(1 for num in subseq if num % 5 != 0 and is_power_of_3_or_5(num))
        count_5 = sum(1 for num in subseq if num % 3 != 0 and is_power_of_3_or_5(num))
        if count_3 == count_5:
            s += 1

# Write output to file
with open('235.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{m}\n{s}\n')
```

The `is_power_of_3_or_5` function now checks a number for being a power of 3 or 5 without generating a large set of powers. We've also optimized the loop that generates the powers of 2 to avoid unnecessary iterations beyond the length of the filtered sequence. This should allow the program to run within memory limits and produce the correct output.

The found output is incorrect because the filtering function `is_power_of_3_or_5` is not implemented correctly. It should return `True` only if the number is a power of 3 or a power of 5, not both. Also, we need to ensure that the program counts the sequences correctly, taking into account the length as a power of 2 and the equal count of powers of 3 and powers of 5.

Let's fix the `is_power_of_3_or_5` function first and then revise the sequence counting logic. We'll use two separate functions to check for powers of 3 and powers of 5.

```python
# Function to check if a number is a power of a given base
def is_power_of(x, base):
    if x < base:
        return False
    while x % base == 0:
        x //= base
    return x == 1

# Function to check if a number is a power of 2
def is_power_of_2(x):
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0

# Read input from file
with open('235.in', 'r') as fin:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    sequence = [int(fin.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Filter the sequence to only include powers of 3 or 5
filtered_sequence = [num for num in sequence if is_power_of(num, 3) or is_power_of(num, 5)]
m = len(filtered_sequence)

# Count sequences with equal number of powers of 3 and 5 with length being a power of 2
s = 0
for length in range(2, m + 1):
    if not is_power_of_2(length):
        continue
    for start in range(m - length + 1):
        subseq = filtered_sequence[start:start + length]
        count_3 = sum(is_power_of(num, 3) for num in subseq)
        count_5 = sum(is_power_of(num, 5) for num in subseq)
        if count_3 == count_5:
            s += 1

# Write output to file
with open('235.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f'{m}\n{s}\n')
```

This solution corrects the previous errors by accurately identifying numbers that are powers of 3 or powers of 5 and not both. It also iterates over subsequences of the filtered array that have lengths which are powers of 2, and it counts the number of such subsequences where the number of powers of 3 is equal to the number of powers of 5. This should now produce the expected output.
