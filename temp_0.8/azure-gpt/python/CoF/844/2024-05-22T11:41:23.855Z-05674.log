_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

I apologize for the confusion. Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, I see that the algorithm for the second part of the challenge did not generate the correct output. The logic used for creating the largest number with exactly K pins was flawed.

To correct this, we should prioritize using the digit '7' as much as possible when the number of pins left is 3, as it is the largest digit that can be formed with 3 pins. Following '7', we use '1' for 2 pins. This is because we want to maximize the leftmost digits of our number. If we can't use '7' or '1', we should use the next digit that requires the fewest pins but is the largest possible digit. We will accumulate these digits in a string in decreasing order of their value.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# First, define the number of pins required to print each digit
pins_needed = {
    0: 6,
    1: 2,
    2: 5,
    3: 5,
    4: 4,
    5: 5,

    7: 3,
    8: 7,
    9: 6
}

# Function to solve the first part of the challenge
def find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N):
    min_pins = float('inf')
    max_digit = '0'
    for digit in str(N):
        num_pins = pins_needed[int(digit)]
        if num_pins < min_pins or (num_pins == min_pins and digit > max_digit):
            min_pins = num_pins
            max_digit = digit
    return max_digit

# Function to solve the second part of the challenge
def find_largest_number(K):
    # Sort the digits by pins in descending order for the same number of pins
    digits_by_pins = sorted(pins_needed.keys(), key=lambda x: (-pins_needed[x], -x))
    largest_number = ""
    
    # First, try to use the pins to place '7' if we have exactly 3 pins left,
    # or '1' if we have exactly 2 pins left, as they are the largest numbers
    # for those pin counts.
    while K > 0:
        if K % 2 == 0 and K // 2 > 0:  # Use digit '1'
            largest_number += '1' * (K // 2)
            break
        if K % 3 == 0 and K // 3 > 0:  # Use digit '7'
            largest_number += '7' * (K // 3)
            break
        # If neither of the above conditions are true, find the largest digit
        # we can use with the remaining pins.
        for digit in reversed(digits_by_pins):
            if pins_needed[digit] <= K:
                largest_number += str(digit)
                K -= pins_needed[digit]
                break
        else:
            # If we are unable to find a digit that matches the remaining pins,
            # break from the loop as we cannot proceed further.
            break
            
    return largest_number

In the last solution provided, the second part of the challenge did not handle the distribution of pins correctly to form the largest possible number with exactly K pins. The approach should maximize the value of the most significant digits first, rather than simply trying to fit as many '7's or '1's as possible.

We should be looking to prioritize digits that give the biggest contribution to the number's value for the amount of pins available. We can start by checking if we can fit a '7' with 3 pins, or a '1' with 2 pins, and then try to fit the largest possible digits with the remaining pins.

Let's fix the second part of the challenge using the correct approach:

```python
# Function to solve the second part of the challenge
def find_largest_number(K):
    # The goal is to use as many pins as possible to print the largest digits
    # Start with the largest digit '7' for 3 pins and '1' for 2 pins (if K is odd)
    largest_number = ''

    # If K is odd, use one '1' and then proceed with the even number of pins
    if K % 2 == 1:
        largest_number += '7'
        K -= 3

    # Use '1' for every two pins remaining
    largest_number += '1' * (K // 2)

    return largest_number[::-1]  # Reverse to get the largest number

# Read input data from file
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Solve the problems
max_digit = find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N)
largest_number = find_largest_number(K)

# Write output data to file
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{max_digit}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{largest_number}\n')
```

This updated solution should output the correct largest number that can be printed with exactly K pins. It starts by checking if K is odd, and if so, it uses a '7' (3 pins) and continues with K being even. Then it adds as many '1's as possible (each using 2 pins) to form the largest number. Finally, it reverses the string of '1's to make sure the largest possible number is printed.

The error indicates that the function `find_max_digit_with_min_pins` is not defined. It seems that while implementing the solution for the second part of the challenge, the function for the first part was omitted. Let's correct this by including both necessary functions and ensuring they are defined before they are called.

Here's the revised solution that includes the definition of the `find_max_digit_with_min_pins` function and fixes the logic for the second part of the challenge to match the expected output:

```python
# Function to solve the first part of the challenge
def find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N):
    # Convert number to string and create a dictionary to store pin counts for each digit
    str_N = str(N)
    digit_pin_counts = {digit: pins_needed[int(digit)] for digit in str_N}
    # Find the digit with the minimum pin count and if there's a tie, select the largest digit
    max_digit = max((digit for digit in str_N if digit_pin_counts[digit] == min(digit_pin_counts.values())), key=int)
    return max_digit

# Function to solve the second part of the challenge
def find_largest_number(K):
    # Digits sorted by pin efficiency (largest digit per pin count)
    pin_efficiency_order = '7111111122223333444555666777888899990'
    largest_number = ''
    # Keep adding the most pin-efficient digits until we run out of pins
    for digit in pin_efficiency_order:
        pin_count = pins_needed[int(digit)]
        if pin_count <= K:
            largest_number += digit
            K -= pin_count
            if K < 2:
                break  # Break if we don't have enough pins to form any more digits
    return largest_number

# Read input data from file
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Solve the problems
max_digit = find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N)
largest_number = find_largest_number(K)

# Write output data to file
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{max_digit}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{largest_number}\n')
```

This code should now correctly define both functions before they are used, and the logic in `find_largest_number` has been adjusted to output the largest number that can be formed with exactly K pins. The digits are selected based on their pin efficiency, which is the size of the digit relative to the number of pins required to print it.

The error message indicates that the `pins_needed` dictionary is not defined in the script. This dictionary is crucial as it maps each digit to the number of pins required to print it. It seems I omitted the definition of the `pins_needed` dictionary in the provided code. Let's add that definition and rewrite the solution correctly.

Here's the complete and corrected solution:

```python
# Define the number of pins required to print each digit
pins_needed = {
    0: 6,
    1: 2,
    2: 5,
    3: 5,
    4: 4,
    5: 5,
    6: 6,
    7: 3,
    8: 7,
    9: 6
}

# Function to solve the first part of the challenge
def find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N):
    # Find the digit with the minimum number of pins
    min_pins = float('inf')
    max_digit = '0'
    for digit in str(N):
        num_pins = pins_needed[int(digit)]
        if num_pins < min_pins or (num_pins == min_pins and digit > max_digit):
            min_pins = num_pins
            max_digit = digit
    return max_digit

# Function to solve the second part of the challenge
def find_largest_number(K):
    # Initialize an empty string for the largest number
    largest_number = ''
    # Use a greedy approach, starting from the largest digits
    for digit in '7531':
        while pins_needed[int(digit)] <= K:
            largest_number += digit
            K -= pins_needed[int(digit)]
    return largest_number

# Read input data from file
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Solve the problems
max_digit = find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N)
largest_number = find_largest_number(K)

# Write output data to file
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{max_digit}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{largest_number}\n')
```

This updated code defines the `pins_needed` dictionary before it is used in the `find_max_digit_with_min_pins` and `find_largest_number` functions. It correctly reads the input from 'imprimanta.in', processes the information, and writes the output to 'imprimanta.out'. The `find_largest_number` function has been corrected to follow a greedy approach, prioritizing larger digits ('7', '5', '3', '1') which can be constructed with the fewest pins to achieve the largest possible number with exactly K pins.

After reevaluating the differences between the expected and found result, I identified the issue with the `find_largest_number` function. The current logic is not producing the correct output because it is not optimizing the number formed with K pins. It should prioritize using the pins to form the highest possible digits starting from the left, within the constraint of using exactly K pins.

To form the largest possible number with exactly K pins, we need to use the largest digit (from 0 to 9) that can be formed with the remaining number of pins until we run out of pins.

Here's the correct solution that ensures we form the largest possible number with exactly K pins:

```python
# Define the number of pins required to print each digit
pins_needed = {
    0: 6,
    1: 2,
    2: 5,
    3: 5,
    4: 4,
    5: 5,
    6: 6,
    7: 3,
    8: 7,
    9: 6
}

# Function to solve the first part of the challenge
def find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(N)]
    # Find the digit with the minimum number of pins required to print it
    min_pins_digit = min(digits, key=lambda d: (pins_needed[d], -d))
    max_digit = max([d for d in digits if pins_needed[d] == pins_needed[min_pins_digit]])
    return max_digit

# Function to solve the second part of the challenge
def find_largest_number(K):
    # Create a list of digits sorted by pins needed and then by the digit value
    digits_sorted = sorted(pins_needed.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    largest_number = ''
    
    # Keep trying to add the biggest digit that fits the remaining pin count
    while K >= digits_sorted[0][1]:
        for value, pins in reversed(digits_sorted):
            if pins <= K:
                largest_number += str(value)
                K -= pins
                break

    return largest_number

# Read input data from file
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as infile:
    N, K = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Solve the problems
max_digit = find_max_digit_with_min_pins(N)
largest_number = find_largest_number(K)

# Write output data to file
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{max_digit}\n')
    outfile.write(f'{largest_number}\n')
```

This solution includes a corrected version of `find_largest_number` which iterates through the sorted list of digits in reverse order (starting from the largest digit) and adds the largest possible digit that can be formed with the remaining pins. The function stops when there are not enough pins left to form any digit. This approach ensures that we get the largest number possible with the given number of pins.
