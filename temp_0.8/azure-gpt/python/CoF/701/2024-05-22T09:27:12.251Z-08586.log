Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `balaur.in` and write to `balaur.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

A fost o dată un balaur cu $6$ capete. Într-o zi, Făt-Frumos s-a supărat și i-a tăiat un cap. Peste noapte i-au crescut alte $6$ capete în loc. Pe același gât! A doua zi, Făt-Frumos iar i-a tăiat un cap, dar peste noapte balaurului i-au crescut în loc alte $6$ capete... și tot așa timp de $n$ zile. În cea de a ($n+1$)-a zi, Făt-Frumos s-a plictisit și a plecat acasă!

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de zile, și calculează câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `balaur.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `balaur.out` va conține un singur număr reprezentînd câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 400 \ 000 \ 000$

Example:
`balaur.in`
```
3
```

`balaur.out`
```
15
```

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
# balaur.py

# Read the number of days n from 'balaur.in'
with open('balaur.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the number of heads after n days
# Initially, the balaur has 6 heads
# Each day, it loses 1 head and gains 6 new heads, resulting in a net gain of 5 heads per day
# Hence, after n days, it will have 6 + 5 * n heads
number_of_heads = 6 + 5 * n

# Write the result to 'balaur.out'
with open('balaur.out', 'w') as file:

Certainly! Here is the corrected python code in a markdown code block:

```python
# Read the number of days n from 'balaur.in'
with open('balaur.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the number of heads after n days
# Initially, the balaur has 6 heads
# Each day, it loses 1 head and gains 6 new heads, resulting in a net gain of 5 heads per day
# Hence, after n days, it will have 6 + 5 * n heads
number_of_heads = 6 + 5 * n

# Write the result to 'balaur.out'
with open('balaur.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(number_of_heads))
```

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
3
```
Expected output:
```
15
```
Found output:
```
21
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

I apologize for the oversight. The error in the previous solution lies in the calculation of the number of heads after n days. The initial solution assumed that the balaur started with 6 heads and gained 5 heads per day, but in reality, the balaur starts with 6 heads on day 0, loses one head, and then gains 6 new heads each subsequent day. So the net gain is actually 6 - 1 = 5 heads per day, starting on day 1.

Therefore, after n days, the balaur will have the initial 6 heads plus 5 additional heads for each day after the first day. The correct formula should be:

Initial heads (6) - one head cut on the first day + 5 heads gained per day for (n - 1) days, which yields:

\[ \text{number_of_heads} = 6 - 1 + 5 \times (n - 1) \]
\[ \text{number_of_heads} = 5 + 5 \times (n - 1) \]
\[ \text{number_of_heads} = 5 \times n \]

This will give us the correct result. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the number of days n from 'balaur.in'
with open('balaur.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the number of heads after n days
# The balaur initially has 6 heads, loses 1 on the first day, and gains 5 heads each subsequent day
# Hence, after n days, it will have 5 * n heads
number_of_heads = 5 * n

# Write the result to 'balaur.out'
with open('balaur.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(number_of_heads))
```

This solution should produce the correct output for the given input data. For example, if n = 3, the expected output is 15, which the corrected formula will provide.
