Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed because it ran out of memory or exceeded some limit imposed on it. This could happen if the program enters an infinite loop or consumes too much memory. In this case, the provided code has a logical issue where it is decrementing the `rotations_remaining` for empty cabins, which could result in an infinite loop if the last client finishes his rotations before the code checks for `any(rotations_remaining)` to be false.

Let's correct the program by ensuring that it does not enter an infinite loop. We should only decrement `rotations_remaining` for cabins that actually have a client in them. Additionally, we will fix the issue of finding the last cabin with a client. Since the cabins are numerated from 1 to n, we need to add 1 to the index to get the correct cabin number, and there is no need to use modulus operation on it.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# roata.py

def main():
    with open('roata.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        p = int(fin.readline().strip())
        ci = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

    total_sum = sum(ci)
    clients_queue = list(range(1, p + 1))
    rotations_remaining = [0] * n  # A list to keep track of remaining rotations for each cabin
    cabins = [0] * n  # A list representing the cabins, initially empty
    clients_order = []

    # Load the cabins with the first n or p clients (whichever is smaller)
    for i in range(min(n, p)):
        client_number = clients_queue.pop(0)
        cabins[i] = client_number
        rotations_remaining[i] = ci[client_number - 1]

    current_cabin = 0  # Start with the first cabin
    while clients_queue or any(rotations_remaining):
        if rotations_remaining[current_cabin] == 0:
            if cabins[current_cabin] != 0:  # A client is in the cabin
                clients_order.append(cabins[current_cabin])
                cabins[current_cabin] = 0  # Mark this cabin as empty

            # If more clients are waiting, load the next client into the cabin
            if clients_queue:
                client_number = clients_queue.pop(0)
                cabins[current_cabin] = client_number
                rotations_remaining[current_cabin] = ci[client_number - 1] - 1
            else:
                rotations_remaining[current_cabin] = 0
        else:
            rotations_remaining[current_cabin] -= 1

        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n

    # Find the last cabin with a client
    last_client_number = max(clients_order)
    last_cabin_with_client = cabins.index(last_client_number) + 1

    with open('roata.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{total_sum}\n')
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, clients_order)) + '\n')
        fout.write(f'{last_cabin_with_client}\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':

The error message indicates that the program is trying to find the index of a client number in the `cabins` list that does not exist. This is happening because some clients may have already descended from the wheel and are no longer in any of the cabins.

To fix this issue, we need to track the last client who descends in a different way. We can keep track of the last client to descend by updating a variable whenever a client descends from the wheel. Let's revise the program with the necessary fixes:

```python
# roata.py

def main():
    with open('roata.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        p = int(fin.readline().strip())
        ci = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

    total_sum = sum(ci)
    clients_queue = list(range(1, p + 1))
    rotations_remaining = [0] * n  # A list to keep track of remaining rotations for each cabin
    cabins = [0] * n  # A list representing the cabins, initially empty
    clients_order = []

    # Load the cabins with the first n or p clients (whichever is smaller)
    for i in range(min(n, p)):
        client_number = clients_queue.pop(0)
        cabins[i] = client_number
        rotations_remaining[i] = ci[client_number - 1]

    current_cabin = 0  # Start with the first cabin
    last_client_number = 0  # Initialize the last client number
    while clients_queue or any(rotations_remaining):
        if rotations_remaining[current_cabin] == 0 and cabins[current_cabin] != 0:
            # A client is in the cabin and has completed all rotations
            last_client_number = cabins[current_cabin]
            clients_order.append(last_client_number)
            cabins[current_cabin] = 0  # Mark this cabin as empty

            # If more clients are waiting, load the next client into the cabin
            if clients_queue:
                client_number = clients_queue.pop(0)
                cabins[current_cabin] = client_number
                rotations_remaining[current_cabin] = ci[client_number - 1]

        # Move to the next cabin
        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n

        if cabins[current_cabin] != 0:  # Only decrement if the cabin is not empty
            rotations_remaining[current_cabin] -= 1

    # Find the last cabin with a client
    # Since last_client_number is the number of the last client who descended,
    # we need to find the cabin where this client was last seated.
    last_cabin_with_client = (cabins.index(0) + 1) % n or n

    with open('roata.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{total_sum}\n')
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, clients_order)) + '\n')
        fout.write(f'{last_cabin_with_client}\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This version of the program initializes a `last_client_number` variable to keep track of the last client that descended, which is updated each time a client descends. When determining the last cabin, we find the index of the first empty cabin after the last client has descended and adjust it to match the cabin numbering (which starts at 1). If the index of the empty cabin is 0, it means the last client descended from the last cabin (`n`). The result is written to `roata.out` as before. Save this script as `roata.py` and run it in the directory with `roata.in`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates a couple of issues:

1. The client order is missing the last client number (6) who should have been the last to descend.
2. The last cabin with a client is incorrectly calculated as cabin 1 instead of cabin 3.

The problem with the current solution is that it assumes when `rotations_remaining[current_cabin]` is 0 and the cabin is not empty, the client has finished their ride. However, clients could have a remainder of 0 rotations because they are yet to start their ride, not because they have finished it.

To fix these issues, we should:

- Simplify the algorithm by simulating a queue of clients with their remaining rides.
- Keep track of the total number of rides completed and the cabin where each client started.
- After processing all rides, we can determine the last cabin by considering the total number of rides modulo the number of cabins.

Let's implement the improved solution:

```python
# roata.py

def main():
    with open('roata.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of cabins
        p = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of clients
        ci = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))  # Number of rides each client bought

    total_rides = sum(ci)  # Total number of rides bought
    total_sum = total_rides  # Each ride costs 1 EUR

    # Initialize the queue with (client_number, remaining_rides)
    clients_queue = [(i + 1, ci[i]) for i in range(p)]

    # The cabin where the last client started
    last_client_start_cabin = (p - 1) % n + 1

    # The list to record the order in which clients finish
    clients_order = []

    # The number of rides left before all clients have ridden
    rides_left = total_rides

    while rides_left:
        client_number, remaining_rides = clients_queue.pop(0)

        # The number of rides to simulate for the current client
        rides_to_simulate = min(remaining_rides, rides_left)

        # The cabin number where this client will finish
        final_cabin = (last_client_start_cabin + rides_to_simulate - 1) % n or n

        # Update for the next iteration
        rides_left -= rides_to_simulate
        clients_order.append(client_number)

        # If the client has more rides left, they go back to the end of the queue
        if remaining_rides > rides_to_simulate:
            clients_queue.append((client_number, remaining_rides - rides_to_simulate))

    with open('roata.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{total_sum}\n')
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, clients_order)) + '\n')
        fout.write(f'{final_cabin}\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution keeps the logic much simpler by using a queue and tracking the number of rides left. Each iteration simulates the client's ride until the queue is empty. We keep track of the last client's starting cabin and use it to calculate the cabin where the last ride finishes. Save this script as `roata.py` and run it in the directory with `roata.in`. It should now produce the correct output as per the given example.

The problem with the previous solution is that it incorrectly assumes that clients finish their rides in the order they start them, which is not necessarily the case. The clients should be processed in batches, based on how many rotations each cabin can take before a client descends. Additionally, the determination of the cabin from which the last client disembarks should not be based on the last client's starting cabin but on where they actually disembarked.

Let's correct the algorithm by implementing a simulation of the ride process that correctly tracks the order in which clients descend and the last cabin from which a client disembarks.

Here's a corrected solution:

```python
# roata.py

def main():
    with open('roata.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        p = int(fin.readline().strip())
        ci = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

    total_sum = sum(ci)
    clients_queue = [(i + 1, ci[i]) for i in range(p)]  # Queue of (client_number, rotations)
    cabins = [None] * n  # Current client in each cabin
    clients_order = []  # Order in which clients descend
    total_rotations = 0  # Counter for total rotations

    # Fill the initial cabins
    for i in range(min(n, p)):
        cabins[i] = clients_queue.pop(0)

    while any(cabins):
        # Find the minimum rotations needed before the next client descends
        min_rotations = min(rotations for _, rotations in cabins if rotations is not None)
        total_rotations += min_rotations

        # Update rotations and process clients descending
        for i in range(n):
            if cabins[i] is not None:
                client_number, rotations = cabins[i]
                rotations -= min_rotations
                if rotations == 0:  # Client finishes and descends
                    clients_order.append(client_number)
                    cabins[i] = clients_queue.pop(0) if clients_queue else None
                else:
                    cabins[i] = (client_number, rotations)

    # Calculate the last cabin from which the client descends
    last_cabin = (total_rotations - 1) % n + 1

    with open('roata.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{total_sum}\n')
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, clients_order)) + '\n')
        fout.write(f'{last_cabin}\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution properly fills the cabins with the initial clients and then enters a loop that continues until all cabins are empty. It calculates the number of rotations until the next client descends, updates the rotations for each client, and tracks the order in which clients leave the wheel. After all clients have descended, it uses the total number of rotations to find the last cabin from which the client disembarks.

Save this script as `roata.py` and run it in the directory with `roata.in`. This corrected version should now produce the correct output.

The error arises because the cabins list may contain `None` elements, and the generator expression inside the `min()` function tries to unpack those `None` values into two variables, which is not possible.

To fix this issue, we need to filter out the `None` values before unpacking. Let's adjust the code accordingly:

```python
# roata.py

def main():
    with open('roata.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())
        p = int(fin.readline().strip())
        ci = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

    total_sum = sum(ci)
    clients_order = []  # Order in which clients descend

    # Initializing the wheel with tuples (client_number, remaining_rotations)
    wheel = [(i + 1, ci[i]) for i in range(min(n, p))] + [None] * (n - min(n, p))

    total_rotations = 0  # Counter for total rotations
    # Process until all clients have finished their rides
    while len(clients_order) < p:
        # Find the cabin with the minimum remaining rotations
        min_rotations = min((rotations for _, rotations in wheel if rotations), default=0)
        # Rotate the wheel for the minimum rotations
        total_rotations += min_rotations

        # Update remaining rotations and add clients to the exit order
        for i in range(n):
            if wheel[i]:
                client_number, rotations = wheel[i]
                rotations -= min_rotations
                if rotations == 0:  # Client finishes
                    clients_order.append(client_number)
                    if len(clients_order) < p:  # If there are more clients
                        wheel[i] = (len(clients_order) + 1, ci[len(clients_order)])
                    else:
                        wheel[i] = None
                else:
                    wheel[i] = (client_number, rotations)

        wheel = wheel[1:] + wheel[:1]  # Rotate the wheel

    # Calculate the last cabin from which the client descends
    last_cabin = (total_rotations - 1) % n + 1

    with open('roata.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(str(total_sum) + '\n')
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, clients_order)) + '\n')
        fout.write(str(last_cabin) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this fixed version, we use a list called `wheel` to represent the state of the Ferris wheel, which is initialized with the first group of clients or is filled with `None` for empty cabins. We use a while loop to continue processing until all clients have finished their rides. Inside the loop, we calculate the minimum rotations until the next client finishes, rotate the wheel, and then update the remaining rotations for each client. Once a client's rotations reach zero, they are added to the `clients_order` list, and if there are more clients waiting, the next client is loaded into the wheel. Finally, we determine the last cabin from which the client descends using the total number of rotations.

The previous solution still did not properly handle the order of clients as they disembark the wheel and incorrectly calculated the cabin numbers for each client's exit. To fix these issues, we need to ensure that we handle each cabin's state correctly, simulate the wheel's rotation properly, and track which client leaves from which cabin.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct handling of these aspects:

```python
# roata.py

def main():
    with open('roata.in', 'r') as fin:
        n = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of cabins
        p = int(fin.readline().strip())  # Number of clients
        ci = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))  # Number of rides each client bought

    total_sum = sum(ci)  # Total sum of rides bought
    
    # Initialize the wheel with clients and their remaining rotations
    wheel = [(i + 1, ci[i]) for i in range(min(n, p))] + [None] * (n - min(n, p))
    clients_order = []  # Order in which clients disembark
    current_client = min(n, p)  # Index of the current client to embark
    
    while wheel.count(None) != n:  # While there are clients on the wheel
        min_rotation = min([rotations for _, rotations in wheel if rotations is not None], default=0)
        
        # Process the rotations for each cabin
        for i in range(n):
            if wheel[i] is not None:
                client, rotations = wheel[i]
                rotations -= min_rotation
                if rotations <= 0:  # Client has finished their rides
                    clients_order.append(client)
                    wheel[i] = None  # Remove client from the cabin
                    if current_client < p:  # If there are more clients waiting
                        wheel[i] = (current_client + 1, ci[current_client])  # Embark next client
                        current_client += 1
        
        # Rotate the wheel
        wheel = wheel[-1:] + wheel[:-1]

    # Calculate the cabin from which the last client disembarks
    last_cabin = (n - wheel[::-1].index(None)) % n
    last_cabin = n if last_cabin == 0 else last_cabin  # Correct cabin numbering

    with open('roata.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{total_sum}\n')
        fout.write(' '.join(map(str, clients_order)) + '\n')
        fout.write(f'{last_cabin}\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this implementation, we maintain a `wheel` list representing the cabins where each tuple contains the client number and their remaining rotations. We process rotations by finding the minimum rotations remaining for any client on the wheel and then subtracting those rotations from all occupied cabins. When a client finishes their rides, they are appended to the `clients_order` list, and the cabin is marked as `None`. If there are more clients waiting, the next client embarks immediately. After processing all clients, we find the cabin from which the last client disembarked by looking for the last `None` in the reversed wheel list and adjusting for proper cabin numbering, which starts at 1.

Please save this script as `roata.py` and run it in the directory with `roata.in` to produce the `roata.out` file with the expected results.
