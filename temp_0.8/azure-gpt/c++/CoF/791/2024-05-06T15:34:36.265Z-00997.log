Se consideră matricea $A$ ale cărei elemente pot avea doar valorile $0$ sau $1$ și în care numerotarea liniilor și numerotarea coloanelor începe de la $1$. Pentru un element oarecare al matricei, definim noțiunea de vecin ca fiind acele elementele din matrice aflate în imediata sa apropiere pe una dintre direcțiile orizontală, verticală sau pe cele două diagonale (vezi figura de mai jos în care s-au marcat cu $x$ vecinii elementului marcat cu $o$). Un vecin bun al elementului $A_{ij}$ este un vecin care are aceeași valoare cu $A_{ij}$.

~[vecini.png]

# Cerință

Dându-se matricea $A$, să se determine numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei precum și numărul de elemente care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `vecini.in` conține pe prima linie trei valori naturale $m \ n \ k$ reprezentând numărul de linii, numărul de coloane și respectiv numărul de valori egale cu $1$ din matricea $A$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii se află două valori $i$ si $j$ cu semnificația $A_{ij}$ este egal cu $1$. Aceste valori sunt date in ordinea parcurgerii matricei pe linii de la linia $1$ la linia $m$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vecini.out` va conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate printr-un singur spațiu: $x$ va reprezenta numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei date, iar $y$ va reprezenta numărul de elemente din matricea dată care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m,n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq k \leq n \cdot m / 2+1$;
* Pentru $30$% dintre teste $2 \leq m,n \leq 200$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Below is a C++ solution for the given problem, which reads from `vecini.in` and writes to `vecini.out` using file streams for input and output to meet the requirement of avoiding `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, and `scanf`.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("vecini.in");
    std::ofstream fout("vecini.out");

    int m, n, k, i, j;
    fin >> m >> n >> k;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m + 2, std::vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
    while (k--) {
        fin >> i >> j;
        matrix[i][j] = 1;
    }

    int max_neighbors = 0;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                int neighbors = matrix[i-1][j-1] + matrix[i-1][j] + matrix[i-1][j+1] +
                                matrix[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j+1] +
                                matrix[i+1][j-1] + matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1];
                if (neighbors > max_neighbors) {
                    max_neighbors = neighbors;
                    max_count = 1;
                } else if (neighbors == max_neighbors) {
                    ++max_count;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_neighbors << " " << max_count << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution constructs a matrix with a border of zeroes to avoid checking for out-of-bounds access when counting neighbors. The file stream `fin` is used to read the input from `vecini.in`, and `fout` is used to write the output to `vecini.out`. It first populates the matrix with the given ones and then iterates through all elements to count the number of good neighbors for each `1`. It tracks the maximum number of neighbors and the count of elements with that maximum. Finally, it outputs these values.

Let's evaluate the problem by analyzing the given example:

Input data:
```
3 4 7
1 3
2 1
2 4
3 1
3 4
3 3
3 2
```

Expected output:
```
3 6
```

In the given output, we can see that the maximum number of good neighbors is `3` and there are `6` elements with that number of good neighbors. The previous solution did not take into account that `0` elements can also have good neighbors (which are also zeros). We only counted the neighbors for `1` elements.

To fix this issue, we need to iterate over all elements of the matrix, and for each element, we count the number of good neighbors it has, regardless of whether it is a `0` or a `1`. We then compare this with the current maximum and update the maximum and count accordingly.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("vecini.in");
    std::ofstream fout("vecini.out");

    int m, n, k, i, j;
    fin >> m >> n >> k;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m + 2, std::vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
    while (k--) {
        fin >> i >> j;
        matrix[i][j] = 1;
    }

    int max_neighbors = 0;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int neighbors = matrix[i-1][j-1] + matrix[i-1][j] + matrix[i-1][j+1] +
                            matrix[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j+1] +
                            matrix[i+1][j-1] + matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1];
            if (neighbors > max_neighbors) {
                max_neighbors = neighbors;
                max_count = 1;
            } else if (neighbors == max_neighbors) {
                ++max_count;
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_neighbors << " " << max_count << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution creates an extended matrix with one extra row and column on each side, which are initialized to `0` by default. It counts good neighbors for all elements (both `0` and `1`) and updates the maximum number of good neighbors and the respective count. It outputs the final result to `vecini.out`. This should now give the correct output of `3 6` for the provided example.

It appears that the solution is still not correctly considering the constraints of good neighbors for both `0` and `1` elements. The provided code is also not checking the value of the current element against its neighbors to determine if they are good (matching) neighbors.

We need a solution that:
1. Iterates through every element in the matrix (both `0` and `1`).
2. Counts the good neighbors of each element by checking if the neighbors have the same value.
3. Updates the maximum number of good neighbors and the count of such elements.

Here's the corrected C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int count_good_neighbors(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix, int i, int j) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int dx = -1; dx <= 1; ++dx) {
        for (int dy = -1; dy <= 1; ++dy) {
            if (dx == 0 && dy == 0) continue;  // Skip the element itself
            if (matrix[i + dx][j + dy] == matrix[i][j]) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("vecini.in");
    std::ofstream fout("vecini.out");

    int m, n, k, i, j;
    fin >> m >> n >> k;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m + 2, std::vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
    while (k--) {
        fin >> i >> j;
        matrix[i][j] = 1;
    }

    int max_neighbors = 0;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int neighbors = count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j);
            if (neighbors > max_neighbors) {
                max_neighbors = neighbors;
                max_count = 1;
            } else if (neighbors == max_neighbors) {
                max_count++;
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_neighbors << " " << max_count << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this updated solution:
- We added a function `count_good_neighbors` to count the good neighbors of each element.
- The main loop now runs through every cell in the input matrix, not just the ones with value `1`.
- When counting neighbors, we compare the neighbor's value with the current cell's value, ensuring we only count good (matching) neighbors.
- The matrix has padding of `0` around the original matrix to simplify the bounds checking.

This should provide the correct output for the given example and adhere to the problem requirements.

The previous solution still failed to provide the correct result because it did not correctly handle the padding of the matrix. The padding caused the function `count_good_neighbors` to incorrectly count the surrounding zeros for elements on the edge, which should not have any neighbors outside the bounds of the original matrix.

Let's reimplement the solution, ensuring that we handle the padding correctly and only count the neighbors within the bounds of the original matrix.

Here is the fixed and correct implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("vecini.in");
    std::ofstream fout("vecini.out");

    int m, n, k;
    fin >> m >> n >> k;
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m + 2, std::vector<int>(n + 2, 0));

    // Read the positions where the element is 1 and set them in the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        fin >> x >> y;
        matrix[x][y] = 1;
    }

    int max_good_neighbors = 0; // Maximum number of good neighbors
    int count_max = 0;          // Count of elements with maximum good neighbors

    // Offsets for all eight possible neighbors
    const int dx[] = {-1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1};
    const int dy[] = {-1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1};

    // Check each cell for good neighbors
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int good_neighbors = 0;
            // Count good neighbors
            for (int d = 0; d < 8; ++d) {
                int ni = i + dx[d];
                int nj = j + dy[d];
                if (matrix[ni][nj] == matrix[i][j]) {
                    ++good_neighbors;
                }
            }
            // Update max_good_neighbors and count_max
            if (good_neighbors > max_good_neighbors) {
                max_good_neighbors = good_neighbors;
                count_max = 1;
            } else if (good_neighbors == max_good_neighbors) {
                count_max++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the result to the file
    fout << max_good_neighbors << " " << count_max << "\n";

    // Close the files
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation correctly reads the input data and initializes the matrix with padding of `0`. The solution checks each element of the original matrix and counts its good neighbors using the provided offsets to consider the eight possible directions. Finally, it compares the count of good neighbors for each element with the current maximum and updates the result accordingly. This solution should give the correct output `3 6` for the provided example.

Let's diagnose the issue with the previous implementations. The problem specifies that the matrix contains elements with values `0` or `1`, and we need to consider both when counting good neighbors. A good neighbor is defined as a neighboring element with the same value.

The expected output indicates that there should be six elements with exactly three good neighbors. The previous solutions mistakenly counted the padding (border) of zeroes as potential good neighbors, which is incorrect since the padding is outside the actual matrix bounds.

To rectify the solution, we need to:
1. Not add any padding to the matrix.
2. Only count neighbors within the actual bounds of the matrix.
3. For each element, count the number of neighbors with the same value (good neighbors).

Here is the correct solution:
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("vecini.in");
    std::ofstream fout("vecini.out");

    int m, n, k, x, y;
    fin >> m >> n >> k;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m + 2, std::vector<int>(n + 2, 0));

    // Input matrix values
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> x >> y;
        matrix[x][y] = 1;
    }

    int max_neighbors = 0;
    int max_count = 0;
    
    // Note that we are now checking within the m and n bounds, not the padded matrix
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int neighbors = 0;
            // Check all eight directions for good neighbors
            for (int di = -1; di <= 1; ++di) {
                for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; ++dj) {
                    if (di == 0 && dj == 0) continue; // Skip the element itself
                    int ni = i + di;
                    int nj = j + dj;
                    // Check if neighbor is within bounds and a good neighbor
                    if (ni > 0 && ni <= m && nj > 0 && nj <= n && matrix[ni][nj] == matrix[i][j]) {
                        neighbors++;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (neighbors > max_neighbors) {
                max_neighbors = neighbors;
                max_count = 1;
            } else if (neighbors == max_neighbors) {
                max_count++;
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_neighbors << " " << max_count << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```
In this solution, the matrix is not padded with extra zeroes on the edges. When counting neighbors for each element, we ensure that we only consider valid positions within the actual bounds (1 to m for rows and 1 to n for columns). This will yield a correct count of good neighbors and should produce the expected output `3 6` for the given example.
