Jocul “Nu te supăra, frate!” se joacă de către doi jucatori. Pe o pistă circulară cu $n$ căsuţe numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, în ordinea dată de sensul acelor de ceasornic, se află înscrise valorile $0, 1$ şi $10$. Cei doi jucători vor avea fiecare câte un pion şi vor porni pe rând, din căsuţa $1$. Începe jucătorul $1$. Fiecare jucător va muta pionul său conform cu valoarea obţinută prin aruncarea zarului, cumulând sau pierzând puncte în funcţie de căsuţa în care ajunge. Fiecare jucător citeşte valoarea zarului când îi vine rândul.

Jocul are urmatoarele reguli:
1. Câştigătorul poate fi:
	- jucătorul care ajunge primul din nou în căsuţa cu numărul $1$, indiferent de punctaj (exceptând cazul în care are punctaj $0$)
	- în cazul în care se termină şirul aruncărilor cu zarul, înseamnă că jucătorii s-au plictisit şi câştigă cel care a cumulat mai multe puncte, iar dacă au punctaje egale câştigă cel care se află în căsuţa cu număr de ordine mai mare.
2. După aruncarea zarului, jucătorul mută pionul cu atâtea căsuţe cât indică valoarea zarului, în ordinea acelor de ceasornic, începând numărătoarea cu căsuţa următoare poziţiei pe care se află. Prima căsuţă nu conţine valoarea $0$ (zero).
3. După mutare pot apare următoarele situaţii:
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $0$ (zero) – jucătorul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele acumulate şi reia jocul din pozitia $1$
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $10$ – primeşte un bonus de $10$ puncte
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $1$ – primeşte $1$ punct
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă în care se află celălalt pion (cu excepţia căsuţei $1$, când câştigă) – jucătorul care ajunge ultimul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele şi reia jocul de la căsuţa $1$.

# Cerință

Determinaţi jucătorul câştigător, poziţiile fiecărui jucător pe cerc şi punctajul fiecărui jucător.

# Date de intrare

În fişierul `joc.in` se dau:
- Pe prima linie numărul $n$ al casutelor din cerc.
- Linia a doua conţine o succesiune de $n$ valori ($0, 1$ sau $10$), separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând valoarea fiecărei căsuţe.
- Linia a treia conţine numărul de aruncări cu zarul
- Linia a patra conţine o succesiune de valori întregi cuprinse între $1$ şi $6$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând aruncarea cu zarul. 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `joc.out` va conţine $3$ linii cu următoarele informaţii:
- pe prima linie: jucătorul câştigător
- pe a doua linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $1$.
- pe a treia linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $2$.

The code reads the game configuration from `joc.in`, simulates the game according to the rules described, and writes the result to `joc.out`. It avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, and `scanf()` for I/O operations, using file streams (`ifstream` and `ofstream`) instead. The code also implements the rules of the game and checks for the winner after each roll.

The discrepancy in the results is due to the incorrect identification of the winner when the game finishes because of a player reaching the starting position (position 1) with a non-zero score. In the original code, when a player reaches position 1 and has more than 0 points, the `finished` flag is set to true, and the next player is switched to before checking for the winner. However, this behavior results in the code mistakenly reporting the wrong winner as it advances the `currentPlayer`, thus not taking into account that the current player already won the game before the switch.

To fix this, we need to adjust the winner to be set immediately when the game finishes, without switching the current player.

Let's revise the code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("joc.in");
    std::ofstream fout("joc.out");

    int n, m, roll;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> board(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fin >> board[i];
    }
    fin >> m;
    
    int pos[2] = {1, 1}, score[2] = {0, 0};
    bool finished = false;
    int winner = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < m && !finished; ++i) {
        for (int currentPlayer = 0; currentPlayer < 2 && !finished; ++currentPlayer) {
            fin >> roll;
            pos[currentPlayer] = (pos[currentPlayer] + roll - 1) % n + 1; // Move player

            // Process the cell the player landed on
            if (board[pos[currentPlayer]] == 0) {
                score[currentPlayer] = 0; // Lose all points on zero
                pos[currentPlayer] = 1; // Restart from position 1
            } else {
                score[currentPlayer] += board[pos[currentPlayer]];
            }

            // Check if players meet, excluding starting position
            if (pos[0] == pos[1] && pos[currentPlayer] != 1) {
                score[!currentPlayer] = 0; // Other player loses points
                pos[!currentPlayer] = 1; // Other player restarts from position 1
            }

            // Winner check
            if (pos[currentPlayer] == 1 && score[currentPlayer] > 0) {
                finished = true;
                winner = currentPlayer + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    // Decide winner if not already decided by reaching position 1 with non-zero score
    if (!winner) {
        if (score[0] > score[1] || (score[0] == score[1] && pos[0] > pos[1])) {
            winner = 1;
        } else {
            winner = 2;
        }
    }

    // Output results
    fout << winner << "\n";
    fout << pos[0] << " " << score[0] << "\n";
    fout << pos[1] << " " << score[1] << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```
In this fixed code, each player's move is processed within a nested loop that terminates if the game is finished (`finished` is true). The winner is set immediately when a player fulfills the winning condition (reaching position 1 with a positive score), without switching to the next player. If no player wins by reaching the starting position with a positive score, the winner is determined by comparing the accumulated scores and positions, as described in the rules.

The discrepancy in the results is due to a bug in the logic that determines when a player wins and how the game should end when the player lands on position 1 with a positive score. In the previously provided code, the game is not correctly terminating when a player reaches position 1 and has a score greater than 0. Also, the current code is not properly handling the case when a player lands on the same position as the other player (other than position 1), which should result in the latter player losing all points and returning to position 1.

To fix these issues, we need to adjust the code to ensure the game correctly finishes when a player reaches position 1 with a positive score and handles the case where players land on the same square as per the rules.

Let's revise the code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("joc.in");
    std::ofstream fout("joc.out");

    int n, m, roll;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> board(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fin >> board[i];
    }
    fin >> m;

    int pos[2] = {1, 1}, score[2] = {0, 0}, currentPlayer = 0;
    bool finished = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        fin >> roll;
        if (finished) continue; // If game is already finished, ignore remaining rolls

        pos[currentPlayer] = (pos[currentPlayer] + roll - 1) % n + 1; // Move player
        score[currentPlayer] += board[pos[currentPlayer]];

        if (pos[currentPlayer] == 1 && score[currentPlayer] > 0) { // Winner check
            finished = true;
            break; // Stop the game if a player wins
        }

        if (board[pos[currentPlayer]] == 0) { // Reset on zero
            score[currentPlayer] = 0;
            pos[currentPlayer] = 1;
        }

        if (pos[0] == pos[1] && pos[currentPlayer] != 1) { // Players meet, not on start
            score[1 - currentPlayer] = 0; // Other player loses points
            pos[1 - currentPlayer] = 1; // Other player restarts from position 1
        }

        currentPlayer = 1 - currentPlayer; // Switch to other player
    }

    // Determine the winner if not already identified
    if (!finished) {
        finished = true;
        // Check who has a higher score or who's further on the board
        if (score[0] > score[1] || (score[0] == score[1] && pos[0] > pos[1])) {
            currentPlayer = 0;
        } else {
            currentPlayer = 1;
        }
    }

    // Output results
    fout << (currentPlayer + 1) << "\n";
    fout << pos[0] << " " << score[0] << "\n";
    fout << pos[1] << " " << score[1] << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The code handles all game outcomes according to the rules, including:
1. When a player lands on position 1 with a positive score, they win immediately.
2. When a player lands on a zero square, they lose all points and go back to position 1.
3. When two players land on the same square (other than start), the last player to land there loses all points and goes back to position 1.

The code then determines the winner based on the game state after all rolls have been processed if no one has won by returning to the start with a positive score.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result occurs because the code is not properly handling the case when a player lands on the same square as the other player, and the last player to land there should lose all points and go back to position 1. The logic for checking the winner is also incorrect as it doesn't stop the game when a player reaches position 1 with a positive score.

Here is the revised solution that correctly handles these situations:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {

    std::ofstream fout("joc.out");

    int n, m, roll;

    int score[2] = {0, 0}, pos[2] = {1, 1}, currentPlayer = 0;
    bool gameEnded = false;

    for (int roll : rolls) {
        if (gameEnded) // Game has ended, ignore the rest of the rolls
            break;

        // Calculate the new position
        pos[currentPlayer] = (pos[currentPlayer] + roll - 1) % n + 1;
        int points = squares[pos[currentPlayer]];

        // Check for landing on the same spot or zero spot
        if (points == 0 || pos[currentPlayer] == pos[1 - currentPlayer]) {
            score[currentPlayer] = 0; // Current player loses all points
            pos[currentPlayer] = 1;   // Current player goes back to start
        } else {
            score[currentPlayer] += points; // Add points for current player
        }

        // Check if the current player has won by returning to the start with a positive score
        if (pos[currentPlayer] == 1 && score[currentPlayer] > 0) {
            gameEnded = true;
        } else {
            currentPlayer = 1 - currentPlayer; // Switch to next player
        }
    }

    // Determine the winner if the game was not ended by a player reaching start with >0 points
    if (!gameEnded) {
        // The game ends due to running out of rolls
        if (score[0] > score[1] || (score[0] == score[1] && pos[0] > pos[1])) {
            currentPlayer = 0;
        } else {
            currentPlayer = 1;
        }
    }

    // Output final game state
    fout << currentPlayer + 1 << '\n'; // Winner
    fout << pos[0] << ' ' << score[0] << '\n'; // Player 1 position and score
    fout << pos[1] << ' ' << score[1] << '\n'; // Player 2 position and score

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should handle all the rules accurately and determine the correct winner, positions, and scores for each player according to the given input.

The found solution does not match the expected result because it fails to properly handle the cases when a player lands on a square with another player, causing the last player to lose all points and go back to position 1. Additionally, the handling of the zero square and victory condition (reaching position 1 with a positive score) is not functioning as intended.

Let's revise the solution, ensuring all rules are correctly implemented:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("joc.in");
    std::ofstream fout("joc.out");

    int n, m;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> squares(n + 1); // Array to store the value of each square

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        fin >> squares[i];

    fin >> m;
    std::vector<int> rolls(m); // Array to store the dice rolls
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        fin >> rolls[i];

    int score[2] = {0, 0}, pos[2] = {1, 1}, currentPlayer = 0;
    bool gameEnded = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < m && !gameEnded; ++i) {
        // Calculate the new position
        int roll = rolls[i];
        pos[currentPlayer] = (pos[currentPlayer] + roll - 1) % n + 1;
        int squareValue = squares[pos[currentPlayer]];

        if (pos[currentPlayer] == 1 && squareValue != 0) {
            // A player wins by finishing with more than 0 points
            score[currentPlayer] += squareValue;
            gameEnded = true; // End the game
        } else if (pos[0] == pos[1] && pos[currentPlayer] != 1) {
            // If players land on the same square, not being the start square,
            // the last player to arrive loses all points and returns to start.
            score[1 - currentPlayer] = 0;
            pos[1 - currentPlayer] = 1;
        } else if (squareValue == 0) {
            // Landing on a square with a 0 loses all points and returns to start.
            score[currentPlayer] = 0;
            pos[currentPlayer] = 1;
        } else {
            score[currentPlayer] += squareValue; // Gain points for current square
        }

        // If the game has not ended, switch players
        if (!gameEnded) {
            currentPlayer = 1 - currentPlayer;
        }
    }

    // Final winner check if the game didn't end on a winning condition
    if (!gameEnded) {
        if (score[0] > score[1] || (score[0] == score[1] && pos[0] > pos[1])) {
            currentPlayer = 0;
        } else {
            currentPlayer = 1;
        }
    }

    // Output the results
    fout << (currentPlayer + 1) << "\n"; // Winner
    fout << pos[0] << " " << score[0] << "\n"; // Player 1 position and score
    fout << pos[1] << " " << score[1] << "\n"; // Player 2 position and score

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly handle all the rules, including when a player lands on a zero square, when players meet on the same square, and the victory condition. It should also correctly determine the winner based on the highest score or furthest position in the case that no player wins by reaching position 1 with a positive score.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the code is not handling all the game rules correctly. Particularly, the following rules need to be carefully implemented:

1. When a player lands on a square with the value 0, they lose all points and restart from position 1.
2. When a player lands on the same square as the other player (excluding position 1), the last player to arrive loses all points and restarts from position 1.
3. The game ends immediately if a player reaches position 1 with a score greater than 0, and that player wins.

The error in the output suggests that the penalty for a player landing on the same square as the other player is not being applied correctly, or the game is not terminating immediately when a player wins by reaching position 1 with a positive score.

Let's fix the solution by revising the game logic to ensure all rules are followed correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("joc.in");
    std::ofstream fout("joc.out");

    int n, m;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> squares(n + 1); // Including index 0 for 1-based indexing

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fin >> squares[i];
    }

    fin >> m;
    int pos[2] = {1, 1}, score[2] = {0, 0}, currentPlayer = 0, winner = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < m && winner == 0; ++i) {
        int roll;
        fin >> roll;

        // Move the current player and update the position
        pos[currentPlayer] = (pos[currentPlayer] + roll - 1) % n + 1;
        
        // Check if the player landed on the same square as the opponent
        if (pos[0] == pos[1] && pos[currentPlayer] != 1) {
            score[currentPlayer] = 0; // Current player loses all points
            pos[currentPlayer] = 1;   // and restarts from position 1
        } else {
            // Apply the effect of the square if the player doesn't meet the opponent
            if (squares[pos[currentPlayer]] == 0) {
                score[currentPlayer] = 0; // Lose all points on zero
                pos[currentPlayer] = 1;   // Restart from position 1
            } else {
                score[currentPlayer] += squares[pos[currentPlayer]]; // Add square value to score
            }
        }

        // Check for a winning condition
        if (pos[currentPlayer] == 1 && score[currentPlayer] > 0) {
            winner = currentPlayer + 1; // The current player has won
            break; // End the game loop
        }

        // Switch players
        currentPlayer = 1 - currentPlayer;
    }

    // Determine winner based on the scores if no one reached the starting position with a positive score
    if (winner == 0) {
        if (score[0] > score[1] || (score[0] == score[1] && pos[0] > pos[1])) {
            winner = 1;
        } else {
            winner = 2;
        }
    }

    // Output the results
    fout << winner << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        fout << pos[i] << " " << score[i] << "\n";
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should now handle the game rules correctly and produce the expected output.
