Un elev a desenat un set format din mai multe pătrate care conțin numere naturale nenule, distincte, consecutive, dispuse în număr egal pe laturi. Pe latura fiecărui pătrat sunt scrise un număr impar de valori. În fiecare pătrat, numerele sunt scrise în ordine crescătoare parcurgând laturile sale, începând din colțul stânga-jos, în sensul invers al acelor de ceasornic. Elevul a numerotat pătratele cu $1$, $2$, $3$ etc. , în ordinea strict crescătoare a numărului de valori conținute de fiecare. Diferența dintre cel mai mic număr din pătratul $P$ ($1$ < $P$) și cel mai mare număr din pătratul $P - 1$ este egală cu $1$. Primele **patru** pătrate sunt:

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to leverage the characteristics of the pattern to compute the values directly, without actually generating all the squares.

1. To determine $K$, the number of values in the $M$th square, we notice that each square has $4l - 4$ values, where $l$ is the number of values on one side (always an odd number). We can represent this as $M = 4(l - 1)$, and because $l$ increases by $2$ for each subsequent square (3, 5, 7, ...), we get $l = 2M + 1$. So, $K = 4(2M + 1 - 1) = 8M$.

2. To find $T$, the square which contains number $N$ on one of its sides, we need to invert the above calculation, figuring out which square has enough values to include $N$. Since each square $i$ starts with the number $8 * \frac{(i - 1)i}{2} + 1$ (sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to $i-1$, multiplied by 8, which is the pattern of increase for each square), we need to solve for $i$ such that $8 * \frac{(i - 1)i}{2} + 1 \leq N < 8 * \frac{i(i + 1)}{2} + 1$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $i$, which can be solved with the quadratic formula.

Here is the solution in C++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

ifstream fin("patrate.in");
ofstream fout("patrate.out");

int main() {
    int C;
    fin >> C;
    
    if (C == 1) {
        long long M;
        fin >> M;
        fout << 8 * M << '\n';  // Output number of values in the Mth square
    } else if (C == 2) {
        long long N;
        fin >> N;
        // Solve the quadratic inequality for T
        long long discriminant = 1 + 8 * (N - 1);
        long long T = static_cast<long long>((sqrt(discriminant) - 1) / 4);
        fout << T << '\n';  // Output square number containing N
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the type of query from the input file, performs the appropriate calculation, and writes the result to the output file without using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf`. It leverages mathematical formulas to directly calculate the number of values in the $M$th square and to find the square number containing $N$, thus ensuring fast execution even for very large input numbers.

The discrepancy in the output is due to an incorrect calculation in finding the square number ($T$) that contains the number $N$. The calculation of the discriminant did not properly take into account the way numbers are distributed across the squares.

Each square starts with the number:
$$8 \cdot \frac{(i - 1) \cdot i}{2} + 1,$$
where $i$ is the square number (starting from 1). The number $N$ will be in the square number $i$ if:
$$8 \cdot \frac{(i - 1) \cdot i}{2} + 1 \leq N < 8 \cdot \frac{i \cdot (i + 1)}{2} + 1.$$

Let's fix the formula for finding $T$. To do this, we need to solve the inequality $N \geq 8 \cdot \frac{(i - 1) \cdot i}{2} + 1$ for $i$. This can be rearranged to $N - 1 \geq 4 \cdot (i^2 - i)$, or $0 \geq 4i^2 - 4i - (N - 1)$.

Now, we can apply the quadratic formula to solve for $i$ as follows: $i = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 4$, $b = -4$, and $c = -(N - 1)$. The inequality implies that we should use the positive square root in the quadratic formula.

With these corrections, let's rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

ifstream fin("patrate.in");
ofstream fout("patrate.out");

int main() {
    int C;
    fin >> C;
    
    if (C == 1) {
        long long M;
        fin >> M;
        fout << 8 * M << '\n';  // Output number of values in the Mth square
    } else if (C == 2) {
        long long N;
        fin >> N;
        // Solve the quadratic inequality for T
        long long discriminant = 1 + 8 * (N - 1);
        long long T = static_cast<long long>((sqrt(discriminant) + 1) / 4);
        if (N > 8 * T * (T - 1) / 2) T++;
        fout << T << '\n';  // Output square number containing N
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution first computes the discriminant correctly, then finds the square root, and adjusts for the integer division by adding 1 before dividing by 4. Additionally, it checks whether $N$ is greater than the sum for the $(T-1)$th square, and if so, increments $T$ by 1 to account for the fact that $N$ belongs to the next square. This ensures that we find the correct square number for the given $N$.

The output is incorrect because the calculation for determining the square number $T$ is not handling the inequalities properly.

We need to correct the inequality we are solving. Given that each square starts with the number $8 \cdot \frac{(i - 1) \cdot i}{2} + 1$, the number $N$ will be in the $i$th square if and only if:

$$8 \cdot \frac{(i - 1) \cdot i}{2} + 1 \leq N \lt 8 \cdot \frac{i \cdot (i + 1)}{2} + 1.$$

To find $i$ such that $N$ is less than the starting number of the $(i+1)$th square, we need to find the largest integer $i$ that satisfies:

$$N \geq 8 \cdot \frac{(i - 1) \cdot i}{2} + 1.$$

This translates to finding the largest integer $i$ for which:

$$N - 1 \geq 4i^2 - 4i.$$

Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for $i$. Since $N - 1$ may not equal $4i^2 - 4i$ exactly for integer $i$, we need to find the highest integer $i$ less than or equal to the positive root of the equation:

$$4i^2 - 4i - (N - 1) = 0.$$

Solving for $i$ will give us two roots, but we are interested in the positive one. We then take the floor of the positive root to get the square number, because we need the last completed square before $N$.

Let's correct the code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

ifstream fin("patrate.in");
ofstream fout("patrate.out");

int main() {
    int C;
    fin >> C;
    
    if (C == 1) {
        long long M;
        fin >> M;
        fout << 8 * M << '\n';  // Output number of values in the Mth square
    } else if (C == 2) {
        long long N;
        fin >> N;
        // Solve the quadratic equation for T
        long long discriminant = 1 + 8 * (N - 1);
        long long T = static_cast<long long>((-1 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 4);
        fout << T << '\n';  // Output square number containing N
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution fixes the calculation by using the quadratic formula to find the integer part of the positive root of the equation that represents the series of values at the start of each square. It then writes this value to the output file, which represents the square number that contains $N$. 

This should provide the correct output for the given input example and meet the challenge requirements.

The error in the output is due to the incorrect handling of the equation that should determine the square in which the number $N$ falls.

To fix the issue, we need to properly solve for $T$ in the quadratic inequality:

$$N \geq 8 \cdot \frac{(i - 1) \cdot i}{2} + 1.$$

Using the quadratic formula, we have:

$$i = \frac{-(-4) + \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-N + 1)}}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{4 + \sqrt{16 + 32 \cdot (N - 1)}}{8},$$

which simplifies to:

$$i = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 8 \cdot (N - 1)}}{2}.$$

We then need to take the floor of this value, because we are interested in the integer part of $i$, which corresponds to the last fully completed square before $N$.

Let's correct the code with a proper handling of the integer part:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

ifstream fin("patrate.in");
ofstream fout("patrate.out");

int main() {
    int C;
    fin >> C;
    
    if (C == 1) {
        long long M;
        fin >> M;
        // Output number of values in the Mth square
        fout << 8 * M << '\n';
    } else if (C == 2) {
        long long N;
        fin >> N;
        // Solve the quadratic equation for T
        long long result = 1 + 8 * (N - 1);
        long long sqrtResult = sqrt(result);
        // Since we are interested in the floor of the value, we subtract 1 before dividing by 4
        long long T = (sqrtResult - 1) / 2;
        // Output square number containing N
        fout << T << '\n';
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code now properly calculates the square number $T$ that contains the number $N$ by solving the quadratic inequality, taking the square root, and adjusting for the integer part by taking the floor of the value. This should now yield the correct output for the given input and for any valid inputs within the constraints.

Let's re-examine the logic for finding the square number $T$ containing the number $N$.

The pattern for the number of values per square is as follows:

- The 1st square contains 8 numbers (3 per side, but the starting corner is counted only once).
- The 2nd square contains 16 additional numbers (5 per side).
- The 3rd square contains 24 additional numbers (7 per side).
- ...

The pattern shows that the $i$-th square contains $8i$ numbers. Since these squares are built consecutively, the highest number in the $i$-th square would be the sum of the first $i$ terms of the sequence $8, 16, 24, ...$, which is an arithmetic series.

We want to find the square number $T$ such that the cumulative sum up to $T-1$ is less than $N$, and the cumulative sum up to $T$ includes $N$. The cumulative sum of the first $i$ terms in the series is:

$$S_i = \frac{i}{2}(2a_1 + (i - 1)d),$$

where $a_1 = 8$ is the first term, and $d = 8$ is the common difference. This simplifies to:

$$S_i = 4i^2.$$

Since we want $S_{T-1} < N \leq S_T$, we need to solve for $T$:

$$4(T - 1)^2 < N \leq 4T^2.$$

To find the integer value for $T$ given $N$, we need to take the square root of $N/4$ and round up, since the number of values in a square is always a perfect square.

Now, let's rewrite the code correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

long long numberOfValuesInSquare(long long squareNumber) {
    return 8 * squareNumber;
}

long long squareContainingNumber(long long number) {
    long long squareRoot = static_cast<long long>(ceil(sqrt(static_cast<double>(number) / 4.0)));
    long long sum = 4 * squareRoot * squareRoot;
    if (number <= sum && number > sum - 8 * squareRoot) {
        return squareRoot;
    }
    return squareRoot - 1;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("patrate.in");
    ofstream fout("patrate.out");

    int C;
    fin >> C;

    if (C == 1) {
        long long M;
        fin >> M;
        fout << numberOfValuesInSquare(M) << '\n';
    } else if (C == 2) {
        long long N;
        fin >> N;
        fout << squareContainingNumber(N) << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the square number containing the number $N$ by taking the square root of $N/4$, rounding up to the nearest integer, and verifying if $N$ actually lies within the range for that square. If not, it subtracts 1 to get the correct square number. This should give the correct result for the sample input and other inputs within the problem constraints.

The previous solutions contained errors in the calculation of the square $T$ that contains the number $N$. To resolve this, let's carefully review the logic and correct the solution.

The $i$-th square consists of $4(i \times 2 - 1)$ numbers because there are $i \times 2 - 1$ numbers on each side, and there are 4 sides to a square with one number being shared by two sides (the starting corner). The sum of the numbers in all squares up to (and including) the $i$-th square is therefore the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term $a_1 = 8$ (from the first square) and the difference $d = 8$ (since each new square adds two numbers per side).

The total sum of numbers up to the $i$-th square is given by:

$$S_i = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) + \ldots + [a_1 + (i-1)d]$$
$$S_i = i \cdot a_1 + d \cdot \frac{i \cdot (i - 1)}{2}$$

Substituting $a_1 = 8$ and $d = 8$, we get:

$$S_i = 8i + 4i(i - 1)$$
$$S_i = 4i^2 + 4i$$

Since we are looking for the square that contains $N$, we want to find the maximum $i$ such that $S_i < N$. This translates to solving the inequality:

$$4i^2 + 4i < N$$

This is a quadratic inequality, which we can solve by finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation:

$$4i^2 + 4i - N = 0$$

Using the quadratic formula, the positive root of this equation is:

$$i = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
$$i = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{16 + 16N}}{8}$$
$$i = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4N}}{2}$$

Since we're looking for the largest integer $i$ such that $S_i < N$, we take the floor of this value.

Let's rewrite the solution with these corrections:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("patrate.in");
    ofstream fout("patrate.out");
    int C;
    fin >> C;

    if (C == 1) {
        long long M;
        fin >> M;
        // Each square has 8M numbers
        fout << 8 * M << '\n';
    } else if (C == 2) {
        long long N;
        fin >> N;
        // Find the largest integer i such that 4i^2 + 4i < N
        long long i = static_cast<long long>(floor((-1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * N)) / 2));
        // Check if N is within the range of square i
        if (4 * i * i + 4 * i >= N) {
            fout << i << '\n';
        } else {
            fout << i + 1 << '\n';
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly calculate the square number containing $N$. The key correction here is the proper handling of the inequality and the correct application of the quadratic formula.

It seems my previous attempts have been incorrect. After careful reconsideration of the problem, let's identify the correct formula to find the square $T$ that contains the number $N$.

The $i$-th square contains $4(2i − 1)$ values because there are $2i − 1$ values on each side. To find the total number of values up to the $i$-th square, we need to sum up these numbers. This is the sum of all values from the first square up to the $i$-th square. Notice that the difference in the number of values from one square to the next is always 8, as each side gets two additional numbers (and there are four sides).

Therefore, the sequence of the number of values per square is: $8, 16, 24, 32, \ldots$

To find the total number of values until the $i$-th square, we use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series:

$$S_i = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2 \cdot a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d)$$

In our case, $a_1 = 8$ and $d = 8$, so:

$$S_i = \frac{i}{2} \cdot (16 + 8 \cdot (i - 1))$$
$$S_i = 4i^2$$

We need to find the largest $i$ such that $S_i < N$. We solve for $i$ using the square root:

$$i = \sqrt{\frac{N}{4}}$$

Since $i$ must be an integer, we will take the floor of $\sqrt{N/4}$ and then check if this $i$ actually includes $N$ or if it needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's correct the code with this logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

ifstream fin("patrate.in");
ofstream fout("patrate.out");

int main() {
    int C;
    fin >> C;
    
    if (C == 1) {
        long long M;
        fin >> M;
        // The M-th square contains 8M numbers
        fout << 8 * M << '\n';
    } else if (C == 2) {
        long long N;
        fin >> N;
        // Calculate the largest integer i such that 4i^2 < N
        long long i = static_cast<long long>(sqrt(N / 4.0));
        // Check if N is in the i-th square or in the (i+1)-th square
        long long Si = 4 * i * i;
        if (Si < N) {
            i++;
        }
        fout << i << '\n';
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should accurately determine the square number $T$ that contains the number $N$ and provide the correct output for the example input as well as conform to the problem constraints.
