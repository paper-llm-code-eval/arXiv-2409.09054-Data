Tânărul Harry Potter a descoperit într-una din camerele castelului Hogwarts, o hartă, care în urma unei vrăji a făcut să apară un text secret. Textul scris doar cu litere mici ale alfabetului englez, constituie o cheie spre o vrajă nouă folositoare la meciurile de vâjhaț. Cheia nouă se obține astfel:

* din textul secret se formează toate cuvintele posibile din litere aflate pe poziții consecutive
* dintre cuvintele formate se alege cel care este cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Se consideră că două cuvinte $a_1 a_2 a_3 \dots a_k$ < $b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots b_l$, cuvintele fiind date prin caracterele ce le compun, sunt în ordine lexicografică dacă există un indice $i \leq k$ sau $i \leq l$ astfel încât $a_i < b_i$ iar $a_j = b_j$ oricare ar fi $j < i$.

Exemplu: dacă textul găsit de Harry este `abcd` atunci din el se vor obține cuvintele: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `ab`, `bc`, `cd`, `abc`, `bcd`, `abcd`, iar soluția este `d` fiind cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, citind textul inițial, determină cuvântul cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic dintre toate cuvintele formate în modul explicat mai sus.

    }

    output << maxWord << std::endl;

    input.close();
    output.close();
    
    return 0;
}

The code reads the input from `harry.in`, finds the lexicographically largest string formed by consecutive characters, and writes it to `harry.out`. It avoids using the restricted I/O functions and uses `ifstream` and `ofstream` to interact with files.

The solution is incorrectly keeping track of the current word and comparing it with the maximum word found so far. It appends characters and checks for the maximum without resetting the `currentWord` when a character less than the previous one is found. This is why the output was `tatep` instead of `tep`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("harry.in");
    std::ofstream output("harry.out");

    std::string text;
    input >> text;
    
    char maxChar = '\0'; // Placeholder for the maximum character found
    std::string maxWord = "";

    // Going through the text from end to start to find the lexicographically largest word
    for (int i = text.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (text[i] >= maxChar) {
            // If the current character is greater than or equal to maxChar,
            // prepend it to maxWord
            maxWord = text[i] + maxWord;
            maxChar = text[i];
        }
    }

    output << maxWord << std::endl;

    input.close();
    output.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```
In this solution, I am iterating through the string in reverse (from last character to first). I keep track of the maximum character found so far (`maxChar`) and build the maximum lexicographic word by prepending characters that are greater than or equal to `maxChar`. This way, the algorithm ensures that `maxWord` is always the largest lexicographic word that can be formed by characters in sequence from the given text.

The result differs because the current implementation only checks for the lexicographically highest character so far and prepends it if it's equal or higher, but it doesn't take into account the formation of words with consecutive characters.

In the given example `tatep`, the algorithm should actually choose `tep` as the highest lexicographically word that can be formed from consecutive characters, but the previous implementation chose `ttp` incorrectly because it only focused on individual characters, not on the consecutive sequence.

To fix the solution, we need to update the algorithm to check for the highest lexicographic sequence, not just the individual characters. Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("harry.in");
    std::ofstream output("harry.out");

    std::string text;
    std::getline(input, text);

    std::string maxWord;

    // Iterate through the text to find the lexicographically largest word
    for (size_t i = 0; i < text.length(); ++i) {
        // Compare the current character to the first character of the current maxWord
        // If it's greater, we found a new maxWord starting at this character
        if (maxWord.empty() || text[i] > maxWord[0]) {
            maxWord = text.substr(i, 1);
        } else if (text[i] == maxWord[0]) {
            // If it's the same, we need to compare subsequent characters
            // to check if we have a new maxWord starting at this character
            for (size_t j = 1; j < maxWord.length() && (i + j) < text.length(); ++j) {
                if (text[i + j] > maxWord[j]) {
                    maxWord = text.substr(i, j + 1);
                    break;
                } else if (text[i + j] < maxWord[j]) {
                    break;
                }
                // If all characters are the same up to the length of the current maxWord,
                // the new word is longer and therefore lexicographically larger
                if (j == maxWord.length() - 1) {
                    maxWord = text.substr(i, j + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    output << maxWord << std::endl;

    input.close();
    output.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this revised solution, the algorithm iterates through the text and checks each character against the first character of the current `maxWord`. If the character is greater, a new `maxWord` is found. If it's the same, the algorithm compares subsequent characters to determine if a new `maxWord` starts at this character. It considers the possibility of a longer word with the same starting character being lexicographically larger.

It seems that the previous solution does not correctly build the maximum lexicographic word because it resets the `maxWord` whenever it finds a character greater than the first character of the `maxWord`. This approach does not take into account the consecutive nature of the characters to form the words.

Let's fix the solution with a correct approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("harry.in");
    std::ofstream output("harry.out");

    std::string text;
    input >> text;

    std::string maxWord;
    char maxChar = 0; // Initialize to the minimum possible character

    // Iterate through the text to find the lexicographically largest word
    for (char ch : text) {
        if (ch >= maxChar) {
            // If the character is greater than or equal to maxChar, it could start a new max word
            maxChar = ch;
            maxWord = ch; // Start a new word with this character
        } else {
            // Otherwise, append the character to the current word if it's increasing the word lexicographically
            maxWord += ch;
        }
    }

    output << maxWord << std::endl;

    input.close();
    output.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution finds the lexicographically largest word by starting a new word every time it encounters a character that is greater than or equal to the greatest character found so far (`maxChar`). It continues building the word by appending characters until it finds a greater character to start a new word. This approach guarantees that we always have the lexicographically largest word formed by consecutive characters.

The difference between the expected and found result is due to a mistake in the algorithm's logic. The code resets `maxWord` whenever a character greater than or equal to `maxChar` is encountered. This behavior is incorrect because it drops the previous sequence of characters that could potentially form a larger lexicographic word when concatenated with subsequent characters.

The correct algorithm should find the lexicographically largest word by continuously updating the `maxWord` as it finds larger characters at the end of the current sequence. When a character is found that is less than the current `maxChar`, it should begin a new possible candidate for `maxWord` and compare this new candidate with the current `maxWord`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("harry.in");
    std::ofstream output("harry.out");

    std::string text;
    input >> text;

    std::string maxWord;
    std::string candidate;

    // Iterate through the text to find the lexicographically largest word
    for (char ch : text) {
        if (candidate.empty() || ch >= candidate.back()) {
            // Append the character if it's greater or equal to the last character in the candidate
            candidate += ch;
        } else {
            // Compare and update maxWord if necessary
            if (candidate > maxWord) {
                maxWord = candidate;
            }
            // Start a new candidate
            candidate = ch;
        }
    }

    // Check one last time after loop ends
    if (candidate > maxWord) {
        maxWord = candidate;
    }

    output << maxWord << std::endl;

    input.close();
    output.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code maintains a `candidate` string, appending characters as long as they are greater than or equal to the last character in `candidate`. If a character is less than the last character in `candidate`, it compares the current `candidate` to `maxWord` and updates `maxWord` if necessary, then starts a new candidate with the current character. After finishing the loop, it performs one last comparison between `candidate` and `maxWord` to ensure the largest lexicographic word is captured.

The previously provided solution does not give the expected result because it incorrectly starts a new candidate whenever a character less than the current candidate's last character is encountered. This logic doesn't properly account for the fact that a subsequent character could still contribute to forming the lexicographically largest word if it is greater than or equal to the characters in the current `maxWord`.

Let's correct the approach with an improved algorithm. The algorithm should look for the lexicographically largest suffix of the string since any such suffix is naturally formed by consecutive characters and cannot be outmatched by any prefix or substring ending before it.

Here's a correct solution implementing that approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("harry.in");
    std::ofstream output("harry.out");

    std::string text;
    input >> text;

    std::string maxSuffix;
    
    // We iterate backwards, keeping track of the lexicographically largest suffix
    for (int i = text.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        // If the current character is equal to or greater than the first character of maxSuffix,
        // it means it should be the start of a new maxSuffix
        if (text[i] >= maxSuffix.front()) {
            maxSuffix = text[i] + maxSuffix;
        }
    }

    output << maxSuffix << std::endl;

    input.close();
    output.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates over the input text backwards and constructs the lexicographically largest suffix. By iterating backwards, we ensure that only the lexicographically largest suffix, which is also the largest word we can form by consecutive characters, is found. The `maxSuffix` is updated only if the current character is greater than or equal to the first character of the current `maxSuffix`, which reflects the formation of a new possible lexicographically larger suffix.

The result differs because the current logic incorrectly constructs the largest suffix by checking if the current character is greater than or equal to the first character of `maxSuffix`. This approach is flawed because it may result in skipping valid intermediate characters that could form the actual largest lexicographical sequence.

To correct this, we need to update the `maxSuffix` only if the current character is greater than the first character of the current `maxSuffix`. If it is equal, we should not automatically update the `maxSuffix` because we do not yet know if the subsequent characters will form a larger sequence.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("harry.in");
    std::ofstream output("harry.out");

    std::string text;
    input >> text;

    std::string maxSuffix;
    
    // Iterate through the text to find the lexicographically largest suffix
    for (int i = text.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        // If the current character is greater than the first character of maxSuffix,
        // it should be the start of a new maxSuffix
        if (maxSuffix.empty() || text[i] > maxSuffix.front()) {
            maxSuffix = text[i] + maxSuffix;
        }
    }

    // Write the lexicographically largest suffix to the output file
    output << maxSuffix << std::endl;

    input.close();
    output.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution ensures that `maxSuffix` is updated only when we encounter a character that is strictly greater than the first character of the current `maxSuffix`. It does not update `maxSuffix` when the characters are equal, avoiding the incorrect inclusion of equal characters that do not contribute to a lexicographically larger sequence. This approach will correctly construct the largest lexicographical word by checking consecutive characters from the end of the text towards the beginning.
