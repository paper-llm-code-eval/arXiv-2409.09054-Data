Marele vrăjitor Prospero are o grădină minunată îngrijită de o sumedenie de spiriduși care n-au altă sarcină decât să zboare la orele dimineții de-a lungul aleilor și să stropească plantele din vasele ornamentale de piatră aflate pe margine. Există un havuz chiar la capătul grădinii și o alee principală ce pornește de la havuz și duce până la intrare. Din aleea principală se desprind alei secundare ce formează ronduri alungite revenind, în același loc, la aleea principală.

Se știe că există $n$ spiriduși, numerotați de la $1$ la $n$, fiecare pentru câte una dintre aleile secundare. Toți pornesc de la havuz la ora $5:00:00$ dimineața cu câte un vas cu apă pregătit de cu seară, străbat aleea principală până la rondul lor, apoi parcurg aleea rondului propriu, revin în aleea principală, se întorc la havuz pentru a se alimenta cu apă și o iau de la capăt la fel, până la ora $9:00:00$ când se retrag la umbră pentru somn. Se știe că toți spiridușii zboară fără încetare, cu aceeași viteză, pe toată durata celor exact $4$ ore. Se cunosc, pentru fiecare spiriduș, numărul de secunde necesare pentru a ajunge de la havuz la rondul propriu și numărul de secunde necesare pentru a parcurge în întregime rondul propriu. Orice spiriduș care ajunge la havuz își umple vasul în exact o secundă, de la un robinet aflat pe marginea havuzului. De exemplu, dacă spiridușul care se ocupă de rondul $5$ din figură are nevoie de $2$ secunde pentru a ajunge la rondul său și de $15$ secunde pentru a parcurge rondul $5$, atunci va reveni la havuz pentru a-și umple vasul la orele $5:00:19$ ($2 + 15 + 2$), își umple vasul și pornește iar la ora $5:00:20$, revine iar la $5:00:39$ și pleacă iar la ora $5:00:40$ etc.

Doi spiriduși nu își pot umple vasul în același moment de la același robinet.

~[elfi.png]

# Cerință

Se cere să se determine numărul minim de robinete cu care trebuie să fie prevăzut havuzul astfel încât nici un spiriduş, în nici un moment, să nu fie nevoit să aştepte pentru a-şi putea umple vasul cu apă.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `elfi.in` se citesc:

* $n$, numărul de spiriduși, de pe primul rând;
* $n$ perechi de forma $c_i \ p_i$ reprezentând numărul de secunde de la havuz la rondul propriu și respectiv numărul de secunde necesar pentru parcurgerea rondului propriu, de pe următoarele $n$ linii ale fișierului.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `elfi.out` se scrie o singura linie cu un singur număr reprezentând numărul minim de robinete necesare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 5 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100$;
* $1 \leq p_i \leq 100$;

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("elfi.in");
    std::ofstream out("elfi.out");

    int n; // Number of elves
    in >> n;

    // Each elf's schedule will be represented by pairs of integers (start_time, end_time)
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> schedule;

    // Read elf data and fill in the schedule
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int ci, pi;
        in >> ci >> pi;

        // Calculate times for the complete rounds (start and end) of each elf and add them to the schedule
        for (int time = ci; time < 14400; time += (ci + pi + 1)) {
            schedule.push_back({time, time + 1}); // +1 for the refill time at the fountain
        }
    }

    // Sort schedule by end_time
    std::sort(schedule.begin(), schedule.end(), [](const std::pair<int, int>& a, const std::pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.second < b.second;
    });

    // Find the minimum number of fountains needed
    int min_fountains = 0;
    int current_fountains = 0;
    int last_refill_time = -1;

    for (const auto& timeslot : schedule) {
        if (timeslot.first > last_refill_time) {
            // We can use the same fountain for this elf
            last_refill_time = timeslot.second;
        } else {
            // We need a new fountain
            ++current_fountains;
            last_refill_time = timeslot.second;
        }
        // Update min_fountains if more fountains are used simultaneously
        min_fountains = std::max(min_fountains, current_fountains);
        // Reset the counter if no elf needs a refill at the current time
        if (timeslot.second != schedule.back().second && timeslot.second < schedule[current_fountains].first) {
            current_fountains = 0;
        }
    }

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_fountains;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the time intervals when each elf reaches the fountain and sorts them by the time they leave the fountain. Then it iterates through the sorted intervals, keeping track of the minimum number of fountains required at any given time. This ensures that no two elves will use the same fountain at the same time, hence minimizing the number of fountains needed.

Upon evaluating the differences, it appears that the previous implementation did not correctly consider the fact that spiriduși (elves) could be at the fountain at overlapping times. The previous solution also undercounted the number of fountains needed because it assumed that spiriduși would always use the same fountain if they reached the fountain at different times, which is not correct since the spiriduși are coming in at different intervals, potentially causing simultaneous arrivals. We need to consider every second to correctly account for the maximum number of spiriduși at the fountain at the same time.

Let's write an efficient solution that uses a more appropriate algorithm to determine the minimum number of fountains needed. We will simulate every second to find the maximum number of spiriduși that are at the fountain at the same time.

Here is the corrected solution in a markdown code block:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("elfi.in");
    std::ofstream out("elfi.out");

    int n; // Number of elves
    in >> n;

    // Create a vector to count the number of elves at the fountain for every second
    std::vector<int> fountain_usage(4 * 3600, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int ci, pi;
        in >> ci >> pi;

        for (int time = ci; time < 4 * 3600; time += ci + pi + 1) {
            fountain_usage[time]++;
        }
    }

    // Find the maximum usage of the fountain at any second
    int min_fountains = *std::max_element(fountain_usage.begin(), fountain_usage.end());

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_fountains;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution considers the total elapsed time for the rounds in seconds and uses a vector to track the number of elves at the fountain at each second. It then finds the maximum number used across all seconds, which gives us the minimum number of fountains needed so that no elf has to wait.

The problem with the previous solution is that it only considered the arrival times of the elves at the fountain and failed to account for the duration of time each elf spends at the fountain. As per the problem statement, each elf spends exactly one second at the fountain to refill their vase. This means that we need to increment the counter for fountain usage not only for the second they arrive but also for the next second when they actually refill their vase. This adjustment should lead to the correct maximum number of fountains needed at any given second.

Let's adjust the solution to increment the fountain usage counter for two consecutive seconds for each arrival time.

Here is the corrected solution in a markdown code block:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("elfi.in");
    std::ofstream out("elfi.out");

    int n; // Number of elves
    in >> n;

    // Create an array to count the number of elves at the fountain for every second
    std::array<int, 4 * 3600 + 1> fountain_usage = {}; // Initialize all to zero

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int ci, pi;
        in >> ci >> pi;

        // For each round the elf makes, increment the usage counter for two seconds (arrival and refill)
        for (int time = ci; time < 4 * 3600; time += ci + pi + 1) {
            fountain_usage[time]++;
            fountain_usage[time + 1]++; // Increment for the refill second as well
        }
    }

    // Find the maximum usage of the fountain at any second, which is the minimum number of fountains needed
    int min_fountains = *std::max_element(fountain_usage.begin(), fountain_usage.end());

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_fountains;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This version of the solution increments the fountain usage counter for the second the elf arrives and the second after (for refilling). Then it calculates the maximum number of elves that would be at the fountain at the same time, which corresponds to the minimum number of fountains required to ensure no elf has to wait.

The latest provided solution overestimated the minimum number of fountains required because it incorrectly incremented the usage for two consecutive seconds whenever an elf arrived at the fountain, causing it to count an extra second for each elf's refill. However, we only need to increment the usage for the specific second each elf actually uses the fountain.

To fix the solution, we should create a timeline that records the arrival and departure of each elf at the fountain for every second. We will iterate through this timeline to determine the maximum number of concurrent elves at the fountain, which corresponds to the minimum number of fountains required.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("elfi.in");
    std::ofstream out("elfi.out");

    int n; // Number of elves
    in >> n;

    // Create a timeline for each second to track arrivals and departures at the fountain
    std::vector<int> arrivals(4 * 3600 + 1, 0);
    std::vector<int> departures(4 * 3600 + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int ci, pi;
        in >> ci >> pi;

        for (int time = ci; time < 4 * 3600; time += ci + pi + 1) {
            arrivals[time]++;
            departures[time + 1]++;
        }
    }

    // Find the maximum number of elves at the fountain at any second
    int min_fountains = 0;
    int current_elves = 0;

    for (int second = 0; second <= 4 * 3600; ++second) {
        current_elves += arrivals[second];
        current_elves -= departures[second];
        min_fountains = std::max(min_fountains, current_elves);
    }

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_fountains;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we have two vectors: `arrivals` and `departures` which keep track of the number of elves arriving and leaving the fountain each second. We then iterate through every second, updating the `current_elves` count and determining the maximum number of elves present at the fountain at any given time, which directly translates to the minimum number of fountains needed.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that there is still an issue in the way the program is calculating the maximum number of elves at the fountain at any given time. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, it might be best to consider an approach that tracks the precise times when each elf needs to use the fountain and then find the point in time with the maximum overlap.

This can be done by creating a list of events for each time an elf arrives at the fountain to refill their vase. Each event is either an arrival or a departure (arrival when an elf starts using the fountain, and departure when they finish and leave). By sorting these events and processing them in order, we can calculate the maximum number of elves that will be at the fountain simultaneously.

Here is the updated and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Define a simple struct to represent an event
struct Event {
    int time;
    bool isArrival; // true for arrival, false for departure

    // Compare events primarily by time, secondarily by type (departures before arrivals)
    bool operator<(const Event& other) const {
        if (time == other.time) return isArrival < other.isArrival;
        return time < other.time;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("elfi.in");
    std::ofstream out("elfi.out");

    int n; // Number of elves
    in >> n;

    // Create a list of events
    std::vector<Event> events;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int ci, pi;
        in >> ci >> pi;

        // Generate events for each elf's trips to the fountain
        for (int time = ci; time < 4 * 3600; time += ci + pi + 1) {
            events.push_back({time, true});     // Arrival at the fountain
            events.push_back({time + 1, false}); // Departure from the fountain
        }
    }

    // Sort the events by time and event type
    std::sort(events.begin(), events.end());

    // Find the maximum number of elves at the fountain at any time
    int min_fountains = 0;
    int current_elves = 0;

    for (const Event& event : events) {
        if (event.isArrival) {
            current_elves++; // An elf arrives at the fountain
        } else {
            current_elves--; // An elf departs from the fountain
        }
        min_fountains = std::max(min_fountains, current_elves);
    }

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_fountains;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly track the arrival and departure of each elf at the fountain and determine the maximum number of elves that will be at the fountain simultaneously, which will equal the number of fountains needed.

The mistake in the previous solution was in the handling of events that occur at the same time. When an elf departs from the fountain (finishes filling their vase), and another one arrives at the same second, the departure should be processed before the arrival to avoid overcounting the number of fountains needed.

To correct this, we need to ensure that departures are processed before arrivals when they occur at the same time. We need to modify the event sorting criteria in the `operator<` within the `Event` structure to prioritize departures over arrivals if they have the same timestamp.

Here is the corrected and updated solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Define a simple struct to represent an event
struct Event {
    int time;
    bool isArrival; // true for arrival, false for departure

    // Constructor for convenience
    Event(int t, bool arrival) : time(t), isArrival(arrival) {}

    // Compare events primarily by time, secondarily by type (departures before arrivals)
    bool operator<(const Event& other) const {
        if (time == other.time) return !isArrival && other.isArrival;
        return time < other.time;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("elfi.in");
    std::ofstream out("elfi.out");

    int n; // Number of elves
    in >> n;

    std::vector<Event> events;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int ci, pi;
        in >> ci >> pi;

        // Generate events for each elf's trips to the fountain
        for (int time = ci; time < 4 * 3600; time += ci + pi + 1) {
            events.emplace_back(time, true); // Arrival at the fountain
            events.emplace_back(time, false); // Departure from the fountain
        }
    }

    // Sort the events by time and event type (departures before arrivals at the same time)
    std::sort(events.begin(), events.end());

    int min_fountains = 0;
    int current_elves = 0;

    for (const Event& event : events) {
        if (event.isArrival) {
            current_elves++; // An elf arrives at the fountain
        } else {
            current_elves--; // An elf departs from the fountain
        }
        min_fountains = std::max(min_fountains, current_elves);
    }

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_fountains;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

By processing departures before arrivals at the same time, we ensure that we don't overestimate the number of fountains required. This solution should now correctly identify the maximum number of elves at the fountain at any given time and write the corresponding minimum number of fountains needed to the output file.

Upon examining the differences between the expected and the found result, it is clear that the output is not what it should be. A bug must exist in the `operator<` logic or elsewhere in the implementation, as the program is outputting 0 instead of the expected 4 fountains. Let's fix the solution, particularly the sorting logic for events, and re-evaluate the calculation of the maximum number of elves at the fountain.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Define a simple struct to represent an event
struct Event {
    int time;
    bool isArrival; // true for arrival, false for departure

    // Constructor for convenience
    Event(int t, bool arrival) : time(t), isArrival(arrival) {}

    // Compare events primarily by time, then by type (arrivals first, then departures)
    bool operator<(const Event& other) const {
        if (time == other.time) return isArrival && !other.isArrival;
        return time < other.time;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("elfi.in");
    std::ofstream out("elfi.out");

    int n; // Number of elves
    in >> n;

    std::vector<Event> events;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int ci, pi;
        in >> ci >> pi;

        // Generate events for each elf's trips to the fountain
        for (int time = 5 * 3600 + ci; time < 9 * 3600; time += ci + pi + 1) {
            events.emplace_back(time, true); // Arrival at the fountain
            events.emplace_back(time + 1, false); // Departure from the fountain
        }
    }

    // Sort the events by time and event type (arrivals before departures at the same time)
    std::sort(events.begin(), events.end());

    int min_fountains = 0;
    int current_elves = 0;

    for (const Event& event : events) {
        if (event.isArrival) {
            current_elves++; // An elf arrives at the fountain
        } else {
            current_elves--; // An elf departs from the fountain
        }
        min_fountains = std::max(min_fountains, current_elves);
    }

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_fountains;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected code, the `Event` structure's sorting logic has been updated to properly handle the case where an arrival and a departure happen at the same time. We prioritize arrivals over departures because an arriving elf needs to find an available fountain, while a departing elf is freeing up a fountain. Also, the time of each event is adjusted to take into account the starting time of the elf's day (5:00:00 AM), which I converted to seconds (5 * 3600). This change should ensure the output matches the expected result.
