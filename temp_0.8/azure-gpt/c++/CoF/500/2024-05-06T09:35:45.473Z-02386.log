În cel mai recent eveniment al companiei Tesla, Paul Musk a anunțat un nod produs inovativ: parcarea autonomă. Fiind cunoscut pentru lansările produselor incomplete, nici parcarea nu este completă, fiind nevoie de o automatizare pentru a atribui câte un loc mașinilor care vor să folosească parcarea.
\
Parcarea este formată din $N$ locuri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, și este deschisă timp de $T$ secunde, începând cu secunda $1$.
Pe parcursul zilei, sosesc $M$ mașini care vor să folosească parcarea, pentru fiecare dintre acestea știindu-se timpul de sosire $s_i$ și timpul de plecare $p_i$. Mașinile vin în ordinea timpului de sosire $s_i$ și ocupă locul de parcare în intervalul de timp $[s_i, p_i]$. Pentru fiecare dintre acestea, trebuie să afișați un loc liber de parcare (dacă sunt mai multe, se poate afișa oricare) în care aceasta se poate așeza sau $−1$ dacă parcarea este plină în momentul venirii mașinii. Dacă o mașină nu are loc în parcare la timpul de sosire, aceasta nu va mai intra în parcare la niciun timp viitor.

La final, Paul este interesat de mașinile care mai sunt rămase în parcare la închiderea parcării, de aceea, vă cere să afișați configurația parcării la timpul $T$.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsesc trei numere întregi $N$, $M$ și $T$, reprezentând numărul de locuri din parcare, numărul de mașini care vin să folosească parcarea, respectiv numărul de secunde pentru care este deschisă parcarea.

Următoarele $M$ linii conțin fiecare câte două numere întregi $s_i$, $p_i$, reprezentând venirea unei mașini la secunda $s_i$ care va pleca la secunda $p_i$.

Mașinile apar în fișierul de intrare în ordine crescătoare după timpul de sosire $s_i$.

# Date de ieșire
Se vor afișa $M + 1$ linii în total, primele $M$ linii conținând fiecare câte un număr întreg între $1$ și $N$ reprezentând locul de parcare pe care îl va ocupa mașina, sau $−1$ dacă nu există niciun loc de parcare disponibil.

Ultima linie va conține $N$ numere întregi, reprezentând configurația parcării la închidere, unde cel de-al $i$-lea număr reprezintă **timpul de sosire** al mașinii de pe locul de parcare $i$, sau $−1$ dacă locul de parcare $i$ este gol.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N, M, T \leq 200\ 000$
- $1 \leq s_i \leq T$
- $1 \leq s_i \lt p_i \leq 200\ 000$
- Considerând următoarele $2 \times M$ valori: $s_1, s_2, ..., s_M, p_1, p_2, ..., p_M$, acestea sunt distincte două câte două.
- **Dacă există mai multe soluții, se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.**
- Pentru 24 de puncte, $s_i + 1 = p_i$, adică fiecare mașină stă exact o secundă.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $p_i \gt s_j$, adică toate mașinile vin înainte ca vreo mașină să plece.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru 24 de puncte, se respectă restricțiile inițiale.

#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;

    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> cars[i].first >> cars[i].second;
    }

    set<int> available; // Stores available parking spots
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        available.insert(i);
    }

    vector<int> departures(T + 1, -1); // Stores the index of the car which will leave at time t
    vector<int> parking(N + 1, -1); // Stores the arrival time of the car at each spot

    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        int arrival = cars[i].first;
        int departure = cars[i].second;

        // Free up parking spots where cars have departed
        for (int t = 1; t < arrival; ++t) {
            if (departures[t] != -1) {
                available.insert(departures[t]);
                departures[t] = -1;
            }
        }

        // Try to park the car
        if (!available.empty()) {
            int spot = *available.begin();
            parking[spot] = arrival;
            departures[departure] = spot;
            out << spot << '\n';
            available.erase(spot);
        } else {
            out << -1 << '\n';
        }
    }

    // Output final parking configuration
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (parking[i] != -1) {
            out << parking[i] << " ";
        } else {
            out << -1 << " ";
        }
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the input file `parcare.in`, processes the arrival and departure of cars in a parking lot, assigns parking spots to the cars if available, and writes the assigned parking spots (or -1 if no spot is available) to the output file `parcare.out`. It also writes the final configuration of the parking lot at the closing time.

---------- assistant ----------

The exit code 139 and the error message `munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer` indicate a segmentation fault caused by improper memory access or deallocation. This error could have occurred due to incorrect indexing or handling of the `departures` vector or the `parking` vector. To avoid such issues, it's crucial to ensure that all indices used with vectors are within the valid range and that no illegal memory operations are performed.

Let's rewrite the entire solution with necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Car {
    int arrival, departure, index;
};

bool cmp(const Car& a, const Car& b) {
    return a.arrival < b.arrival;
}

int main() {
    ifstream in("parcare.in");
    ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    vector<Car> cars(M);
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> cars[i].arrival >> cars[i].departure;
        cars[i].index = i;
    }

    // Sort cars based on arrival time
    sort(cars.begin(), cars.end(), cmp);

    set<int> available;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        available.insert(i);
    }

    vector<int> parking(N + 1, -1); // Stores index of car in the parking spot
    vector<int> result(M); // Stores the parking spot for each car
    set<pair<int, int>> leaving; // Pair of (departure time, parking spot)

    for (const auto& car : cars) {
        // Free up parking spots where cars have left
        while (!leaving.empty() && leaving.begin()->first < car.arrival) {
            available.insert(leaving.begin()->second);
            leaving.erase(leaving.begin());
        }

        // Park the car if possible
        if (!available.empty()) {
            int spot = *available.begin();
            available.erase(available.begin());
            parking[spot] = car.index;
            leaving.insert({car.departure, spot});
            result[car.index] = spot;
        } else {
            result[car.index] = -1;
        }
    }

    // Output the results for each car
    for (int spot : result) {
        out << spot << '\n';
    }

    // Output final parking configuration
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (parking[i] != -1) {
            out << cars[parking[i]].arrival << " ";
        } else {
            out << -1 << " ";
        }
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution follows the same logic but includes necessary fixes to prevent segmentation faults. It sorts the cars based on their arrival time to ensure they are processed in the correct order. It uses a set to manage the departure times and corresponding parking spots. It also ensures that all vector accesses are within bounds to prevent invalid memory access.

The compilation errors suggest that the `std` namespace prefix is missing for the standard library types like `ifstream`, `ofstream`, `vector`, `set`, `pair`, and `sort`. In C++, when using elements from the standard library without `using namespace std;`, you need to prefix them with `std::`.

Let's rewrite the entire solution with the necessary fixes applied:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Car {
    int arrival, departure, index;
};

bool cmp(const Car& a, const Car& b) {
    return a.arrival < b.arrival;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("parcare.in");
    std::ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    std::vector<Car> cars(M);
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> cars[i].arrival >> cars[i].departure;
        cars[i].index = i;
    }

    // Sort cars based on arrival time
    std::sort(cars.begin(), cars.end(), cmp);

    std::set<int> available;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        available.insert(i);
    }

    std::vector<int> parking(N + 1, -1); // Stores index of car in the parking spot
    std::vector<int> result(M); // Stores the parking spot for each car
    std::set<std::pair<int, int>> leaving; // Pair of (departure time, parking spot)

    for (const auto& car : cars) {
        // Free up parking spots where cars have left
        while (!leaving.empty() && leaving.begin()->first < car.arrival) {
            available.insert(leaving.begin()->second);
            leaving.erase(leaving.begin());
        }

        // Park the car if possible
        if (!available.empty()) {
            int spot = *available.begin();
            available.erase(available.begin());
            parking[spot] = car.index;
            leaving.insert({car.departure, spot});
            result[car.index] = spot;
        } else {
            result[car.index] = -1;
        }
    }

    // Output the results for each car
    for (int spot : result) {
        out << spot << '\n';
    }

    // Output final parking configuration
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (parking[i] != -1) {
            out << cars[parking[i]].arrival << " ";
        } else {
            out << -1 << " ";
        }
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that I have added the `std::` prefix to all standard library types and functions used in the code. This should resolve the compilation errors and the program should now compile and run correctly.

Upon comparing the expected output with the found output, it's clear that the parking spot assignment in the program's output does not match the expected one. This discrepancy arises because the code iterates through the sorted list of cars based on their arrival times and assigns the first available parking spot. However, it seems like the code is not correctly freeing up the parking spots when cars leave. This is evident from the fourth car being assigned spot number 1 when it should be assigned spot number 2 according to the expected output.

The mistake lies in the mechanism used to free up the parking spots. The current implementation assumes that we can iterate through the `leaving` set up to the current arrival and remove all spots that should be freed. However, this does not guarantee the correct order of spot assignment if multiple spots are freed at once because sets are ordered by the departure time and then by the parking spot number.

To correct this, we need to properly update the departure times and ensure that we are freeing and assigning spots in the correct order. Let's fix the algorithm accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("parcare.in");
    std::ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> cars(M); // Pair of arrival and departure times
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> cars[i].first >> cars[i].second;
    }

    // Available spots and departure times per spot. Initialize with max value for simplicity.
    std::set<int> availableSpots;
    std::vector<int> nextFreeTime(N + 1, T + 1);

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        availableSpots.insert(i);
    }

    std::vector<int> parkingLot(N + 1, -1);

    // Assign parking spots and update free times
    for (auto& car : cars) {
        // Free up spots where the cars have departed
        for (int spot: availableSpots) {
            if (nextFreeTime[spot] <= car.first) {
                parkingLot[spot] = -1; // Free the spot
            }
        }

        // Rebuild the available spots set according to the updated free times
        availableSpots.clear();
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            if (parkingLot[i] == -1) {
                availableSpots.insert(i);
            }
        }

        // Find the first available spot
        if (!availableSpots.empty()) {
            int spot = *availableSpots.begin();
            parkingLot[spot] = car.first;
            nextFreeTime[spot] = car.second;
            out << spot << '\n';
            availableSpots.erase(spot);
        } else {
            out << -1 << '\n';
        }
    }

    // Output final parking configuration
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        out << parkingLot[i] << " ";
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This fixed solution now checks each parking spot to see if it's available or not by comparing the next free time with the arrival time of the current car. If a spot is available, it assigns it to the car and updates its next free time. After assigning a spot or determining the parking lot is full, it rebuilds the available spots set. Finally, it outputs the final parking configuration at the end of the file.

The main issue with the previous implementation is that it does not correctly simulate the order in which cars leave and make parking spots available. The fixed solution must correctly track when cars leave and free up parking spots in a way that accurately reflects the problem statement.

To achieve this, we can use a priority queue (or a set) to keep track of parking spots as they become available. The priority queue will store pairs of departure time and parking spot number. When a new car arrives, we will free up any spots from cars that have already departed by that time. Then, we will assign the first available spot to the new car if one is available.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct parking spot assignment logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

struct Event {
    int time;
    int spot; // Positive for departure, negative for arrival (to distinguish events)
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("parcare.in");
    std::ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> cars(M); // Pair of arrival and departure times
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> cars[i].first >> cars[i].second;
    }

    std::vector<int> parkingLot(N + 1, -1), parkingSpot(M, -1);
    std::priority_queue<Event> events;

    // Initialize all spots as free from the start
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        events.push({0, i});
    }

    // Process each car's arrival and departure
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        int arrival = cars[i].first;
        int departure = cars[i].second;

        // Free up spots for all leaving cars by or before this arrival time
        while (!events.empty() && -events.top().time <= arrival) {
            int freeSpot = events.top().spot;
            events.pop();
            parkingLot[freeSpot] = -1;
        }

        // If there are free spots, park the car
        if (!events.empty()) {
            int freeSpot = events.top().spot;
            events.pop();
            parkingLot[freeSpot] = arrival;
            parkingSpot[i] = freeSpot;
            // Schedule the departure event
            events.push({-departure, freeSpot});
        }
    }

    // Output the parking spot for each car
    for (int spot : parkingSpot) {
        out << spot << '\n';
    }

    // Output the final parking lot configuration
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (parkingLot[i] != -1) {
            out << parkingLot[i] << ' ';
        } else {
            out << "-1 ";
        }
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, the `Event` struct is used to track both arrival and departure events. We use a negative time for arrivals to ensure that free spots are considered before new arrivals. The parking lot state is stored in `parkingLot`, and the assigned parking spot for each car is stored in `parkingSpot`. The final configuration of the parking lot is then output to the file `parcare.out`. This solution should match the expected output for the given input data.

Evaluate the error message. Think of a solution to fix the program and return the entire source code with the fix.

---

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.
---------- assistant ----------

The compilation error is indicating that there is no `operator<` defined for the `Event` struct, which is necessary when using the `Event` struct as the value type in a priority queue (`std::priority_queue<Event>`). The priority queue needs to be able to compare two `Event` objects to maintain the heap property.

To fix this, we can define a comparison function or operator for the `Event` struct. Let's rewrite the solution by adding a custom comparator for the priority queue and redefine the `Event` struct.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

struct Event {
    int time;
    int spot;
};

// Custom comparator for the priority queue
struct EventCompare {
    bool operator()(const Event& a, const Event& b) const {
        // If times are equal, compare spots
        if (a.time == b.time) return a.spot > b.spot;
        // Earlier events have higher priority
        return a.time > b.time;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("parcare.in");
    std::ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> cars(M); // Pair of arrival and departure times
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> cars[i].first >> cars[i].second;
    }

    // Parking lot status and parking spot for each car
    std::vector<int> parkingLot(N + 1, -1), parkingSpot(M, -1);
    // Priority queue to manage events, with custom comparator
    std::priority_queue<Event, std::vector<Event>, EventCompare> events;

    // Initialize all spots as free from the start
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        events.push({0, i}); // Use zero as the initial time
    }

    // Process each car's arrival and departure
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        int arrival = cars[i].first;
        int departure = cars[i].second;

        // Free up spots for all leaving cars by this arrival time
        while (!events.empty() && events.top().time <= arrival) {
            int freeSpot = events.top().spot;
            events.pop();
            parkingLot[freeSpot] = -1; // Free the spot
        }

        // If there are free spots, park the car
        if (!events.empty() && events.top().time <= arrival) {
            int freeSpot = events.top().spot;
            events.pop();
            parkingLot[freeSpot] = arrival;
            parkingSpot[i] = freeSpot;
            // Schedule the departure event
            events.push({departure, freeSpot});
        } else {
            // If no spots are available, write -1
            parkingSpot[i] = -1;
        }
    }

    // Output the parking spot for each car
    for (int spot : parkingSpot) {
        out << spot << '\n';
    }

    // Output the final parking lot configuration
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (parkingLot[i] != -1) {
            out << parkingLot[i] << ' ';
        } else {
            out << "-1 ";
        }
    }

    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a custom comparator `EventCompare` for the priority queue that orders events by their time and then by their spot number. The priority queue will now correctly order the events based on our custom rules, allowing us to manage the parking lot occupancy and assign spots in the correct order. This solution should compile and produce the expected output for the given input data.

The output is incorrect because the logic in the while loop that attempts to free up spots is popping all events off the queue, including the arrivals, which should not be happening. We also need to make sure that we only attempt to park a car if there is a free spot available.

Let's correct the algorithm and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

struct Event {
    int time;
    int spot;
};

// Custom comparator for the priority queue
struct EventCompare {
    bool operator()(const Event& a, const Event& b) const {
        // Later events have lower priority
        return a.time > b.time;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("parcare.in");
    std::ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> cars(M); // Pair of arrival and departure times
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> cars[i].first >> cars[i].second;
    }

    std::vector<int> parkingLot(N + 1, 0), parkingSpot(M);
    std::priority_queue<Event, std::vector<Event>, EventCompare> events;

    // Initialize all spots as free
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        parkingLot[i] = -1; // No car is parked initially
    }

    // Process each car's arrival and departure
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        int arrival = cars[i].first;
        int departure = cars[i].second;

        // Free up spots for all leaving cars by this arrival time
        while (!events.empty() && events.top().time <= arrival) {
            int freeSpot = events.top().spot;
            parkingLot[freeSpot] = -1; // Free the spot
            events.pop();
        }

        // Find a free spot to park the car
        int spotToPark = -1;
        for (int j = 1; j <= N && spotToPark == -1; ++j) {
            if (parkingLot[j] == -1) {
                spotToPark = j;
            }
        }

        // Park the car or indicate that the parking is full
        parkingSpot[i] = spotToPark;
        if (spotToPark != -1) {
            parkingLot[spotToPark] = arrival;
            events.push(Event{departure, spotToPark});
        }
    }

    // Output the parking spot for each car
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        out << parkingSpot[i] << '\n';
    }

    // Output the final parking lot configuration
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        out << parkingLot[i] << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, we keep track of the parking lot's current status in `parkingLot` and the spot assigned to each car in `parkingSpot`. For each car, we free up spots of already departed cars and then find the first free spot to park the current car. If no spot is available, we write `-1` for that car. At the end of the program, we write the final parking lot configuration to the output.

This solution should now give the expected output for the given input data.
