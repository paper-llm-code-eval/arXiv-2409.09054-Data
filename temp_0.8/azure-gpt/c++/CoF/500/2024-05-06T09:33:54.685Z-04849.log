În cel mai recent eveniment al companiei Tesla, Paul Musk a anunțat un nod produs inovativ: parcarea autonomă. Fiind cunoscut pentru lansările produselor incomplete, nici parcarea nu este completă, fiind nevoie de o automatizare pentru a atribui câte un loc mașinilor care vor să folosească parcarea.
\
Parcarea este formată din $N$ locuri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, și este deschisă timp de $T$ secunde, începând cu secunda $1$.
Pe parcursul zilei, sosesc $M$ mașini care vor să folosească parcarea, pentru fiecare dintre acestea știindu-se timpul de sosire $s_i$ și timpul de plecare $p_i$. Mașinile vin în ordinea timpului de sosire $s_i$ și ocupă locul de parcare în intervalul de timp $[s_i, p_i]$. Pentru fiecare dintre acestea, trebuie să afișați un loc liber de parcare (dacă sunt mai multe, se poate afișa oricare) în care aceasta se poate așeza sau $−1$ dacă parcarea este plină în momentul venirii mașinii. Dacă o mașină nu are loc în parcare la timpul de sosire, aceasta nu va mai intra în parcare la niciun timp viitor.

La final, Paul este interesat de mașinile care mai sunt rămase în parcare la închiderea parcării, de aceea, vă cere să afișați configurația parcării la timpul $T$.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsesc trei numere întregi $N$, $M$ și $T$, reprezentând numărul de locuri din parcare, numărul de mașini care vin să folosească parcarea, respectiv numărul de secunde pentru care este deschisă parcarea.

Următoarele $M$ linii conțin fiecare câte două numere întregi $s_i$, $p_i$, reprezentând venirea unei mașini la secunda $s_i$ care va pleca la secunda $p_i$.

Mașinile apar în fișierul de intrare în ordine crescătoare după timpul de sosire $s_i$.

# Date de ieșire
Se vor afișa $M + 1$ linii în total, primele $M$ linii conținând fiecare câte un număr întreg între $1$ și $N$ reprezentând locul de parcare pe care îl va ocupa mașina, sau $−1$ dacă nu există niciun loc de parcare disponibil.

Ultima linie va conține $N$ numere întregi, reprezentând configurația parcării la închidere, unde cel de-al $i$-lea număr reprezintă **timpul de sosire** al mașinii de pe locul de parcare $i$, sau $−1$ dacă locul de parcare $i$ este gol.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N, M, T \leq 200\ 000$
- $1 \leq s_i \leq T$
- $1 \leq s_i \lt p_i \leq 200\ 000$
- Considerând următoarele $2 \times M$ valori: $s_1, s_2, ..., s_M, p_1, p_2, ..., p_M$, acestea sunt distincte două câte două.
- **Dacă există mai multe soluții, se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.**
- Pentru 24 de puncte, $s_i + 1 = p_i$, adică fiecare mașină stă exact o secundă.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $p_i \gt s_j$, adică toate mașinile vin înainte ca vreo mașină să plece.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru 24 de puncte, se respectă restricțiile inițiale.

This solution should read the input from `parcare.in`, process the parking lot allocation, and output the results to `parcare.out`. It utilizes efficient data structures such as vectors and sets to keep track of car events and available parking spots for optimal performance.

Upon reviewing the output, it appears there is a bug in the current solution and the logic used to assign parking spots and manage the departure times is not correct.

The issues are:
1. We need to map each spot with the index of the car to properly track which car is in which spot.
2. The original solution did not correctly handle the assignment of arrival times during the output of the final parking configuration.

Let's address the issues and rewrite the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("parcare.in");
    ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T, s, p;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    // Create a set to represent available parking spots,
    // and a vector to represent the parking spot occupancy at time T.
    set<int> available_spots;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        available_spots.insert(i);
    }
    vector<int> occupancy_at_t(N, -1);

    // Iterate through each car's arrival and departure times.
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> s >> p;

        // Find the first available spot for the incoming car.
        if (!available_spots.empty()) {
            int spot = *available_spots.begin();
            available_spots.erase(available_spots.begin());

            // Mark the spot as taken by this car's arrival time.
            occupancy_at_t[spot] = s;

            // Output the parking spot number (1-indexed).
            out << spot + 1 << '\n';

            // When the car leaves, add the spot back to the set of available spots.
            available_spots.insert(spot);
        } else {
            // No available spot; output -1.
            out << -1 << '\n';
        }

        // If departure time is at T, update the occupancy_at_t to be -1 (empty).
        if (p == T) {
            occupancy_at_t[*available_spots.begin()] = -1;
        }
    }

    // Output the final parking lot occupancy at time T.
    for (int spot : occupancy_at_t) {
        out << spot << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This rewritten solution should correctly assign cars to the earliest available parking spot and handle the final parking lot occupancy status at time T. It uses a set to efficiently track available spots and a vector to represent the parking spot occupancy at the end of the time period. The solution does not use `cin >>`, `cout <<`, `printf()`, or `scanf()` to read or write data, as per the requirements.

The provided solution does not correctly handle the departure of cars from the parking spots. It prematurely frees up parking spots without considering the departure time of the cars. Additionally, we are not maintaining a record of which car is parked in which spot, which causes an incorrect final output.

To fix this, we need to correctly manage the arrival and departure times of the cars. We need a data structure to track the occupied parking spots and their corresponding departure times so that we can free up spots as cars leave.

Let's rewrite the solution with these fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Event {
    int time;
    int car_id;
    bool is_departure;
    bool operator<(const Event& other) const {
        if (time != other.time) return time > other.time;
        return is_departure < other.is_departure;
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream in("parcare.in");
    ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    priority_queue<Event> events; // Min-heap for events based on time
    vector<int> arrivals(M), park_spot(M, -1), final_parking(N, -1);
    
    // Read arrivals and departures
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        int arrival, departure;
        in >> arrival >> departure;
        arrivals[i] = arrival;
        events.push({arrival, i, false});
        events.push({departure, i, true});
    }

    set<int> available; // Set of available parking spots
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        available.insert(i);
    }

    while (!events.empty()) {
        Event current = events.top();
        events.pop();

        if (!current.is_departure) { // Arrival
            if (!available.empty()) {
                int spot = *available.begin();
                available.erase(spot);
                park_spot[current.car_id] = spot;
                final_parking[spot] = arrivals[current.car_id];
            }
        } else { // Departure
            if (park_spot[current.car_id] != -1) {
                available.insert(park_spot[current.car_id]);
                if (current.time == T) {
                    final_parking[park_spot[current.car_id]] = -1;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the allocated spot for each car, 1-indexed.
    for (int spot : park_spot) {
        out << (spot != -1 ? spot + 1 : -1) << '\n';
    }

    // Output the final parking lot state.
    for (int time : final_parking) {
        out << time << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a min-heap (`priority_queue`) to handle events in chronological order, ensuring that the parking spots are allocated and freed at the correct times. The `available` set tracks which parking spots are free, and `final_parking` records the final state of each parking spot at time `T`. The `arrivals` and `park_spot` vectors are used to store the arrival times and parking spot assignments, respectively. This approach should provide the correct output as per the requirements.

Please compile and run this fixed solution to handle parking allocation and tracking correctly.

The previous solution does not handle the departure of the cars correctly. When a car departs, we need to make sure to free up the correct spot and update the `final_parking` state only if the departure time is at time `T`. Additionally, we need to process arrivals before departures when they occur at the same time to ensure that spots are allocated correctly.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("parcare.in");
    ofstream outfile("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    infile >> N >> M >> T;

    vector<int> departures(N, -1); // Departure times for cars in spots
    vector<int> spots(M); // Parking spots for each car
    set<int> available; // Available parking spots

    // Initially, all parking spots are available
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        available.insert(i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        int arrival, departure;
        infile >> arrival >> departure;

        // Free up spots for cars that have already left
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            if (departures[j] != -1 && departures[j] < arrival) {
                available.insert(j);
                departures[j] = -1;
            }
        }

        // If there are available spots, park the car
        if (!available.empty()) {
            int spot = *available.begin();
            available.erase(spot);
            departures[spot] = departure;
            spots[i] = spot;
        } else {
            spots[i] = -1; // No spot available
        }
    }

    // Output the results
    for (int spot : spots) {
        outfile << (spot != -1 ? spot + 1 : -1) << '\n';
    }

    // Final parking configuration
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (departures[i] != -1 && departures[i] > T) {
            for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
                if (spots[j] == i) {
                    outfile << arrival[j] << " ";
                    break;
                }
            }
        } else {
            outfile << "-1 ";
        }
    }
    outfile << '\n';

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly check for each car's departure time before assigning a new car to that spot. If a spot is becoming available at the current arrival time, it's added back to the set of available spots before attempting to park a new car. The output is generated by checking the `spots` vector for each car's corresponding parking spot and writing the adjusted value (1-indexed) or -1 if the car could not be parked. The final parking configuration is also generated by checking the `departures` vector and matching them with the `spots` index to find the arrival times of the cars that are still parked at time `T`.

The error message indicates that the `arrival` variable was not declared in the scope where it is being used. The variable `arrival` is supposed to be a vector that stores the arrival times of the cars, similar to the `departures` vector which stores the departure times. However, this vector was never declared or filled with data. Also, the logic to update `available` during the iteration over cars is not correctly placed; it needs to be updated as we process each arrival and departure event.

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Event {
    int time;
    bool is_departure;
    int car_index;
};

int main() {
    ifstream in("parcare.in");
    ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    priority_queue<Event, vector<Event>, greater<Event>> events;
    vector<int> parking(N, -1); // Final parking spot states
    vector<int> results(M); // Parking results for each car

    // Read events and sort them
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        int s, p;
        in >> s >> p;
        events.push(Event{s, false, i}); // Arrival
        events.push(Event{p, true, i});  // Departure
    }

    // Process events
    set<int> available; // Available spots
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) available.insert(i);

    while (!events.empty()) {
        Event current = events.top();
        events.pop();

        if (current.is_departure) {
            // Car is leaving, free the spot
            if (current.time < T) {
                available.insert(results[current.car_index]);
            }
        } else {
            // Car is arriving, find a spot
            if (available.empty()) {
                results[current.car_index] = -1;
            } else {
                int spot = *available.begin();
                available.erase(available.begin());
                results[current.car_index] = spot;
                if (current.time < T) {
                    parking[spot] = current.time; // Mark arrival time if before T
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Output results
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        out << (results[i] == -1 ? -1 : results[i] + 1) << "\n";
    }
    // Output final parking state
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        out << (parking[i] == -1 ? -1 : parking[i]) << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a `priority_queue` to process events in chronological order, ensuring that cars are parked and removed from spots correctly. The `available` set keeps track of free parking spots, and the `parking` vector holds the final state of the parking lot at time `T`. The `results` vector keeps track of where each car is parked, with `-1` indicating that the car could not find a parking spot. 

This code should compile and work correctly, producing the desired output.

---------- assistant ----------

The compilation error is due to the lack of a `>` operator for the `Event` struct when used as a comparison in the `priority_queue`. To fix the program, we need to define a `>` operator for the `Event` struct or create a custom comparator for the `priority_queue`.

Here's an updated version of the program with the necessary corrections:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Event {
    int time;
    bool is_departure;
    int car_index;
    
    // Overload the < operator to implement a min heap, reversing the comparison
    bool operator<(const Event& other) const {
        if (time != other.time) return time > other.time; // Earlier events first
        if (is_departure != other.is_departure) return is_departure < other.is_departure; // Arrivals before departures
        return car_index > other.car_index; // Lower-index cars first
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream in("parcare.in");
    ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;

    priority_queue<Event> events;
    vector<int> parking(N, -1); // Final parking spot states
    vector<int> results(M); // Parking results for each car

    // Read events and add them to the queue
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        int s, p;
        in >> s >> p;
        events.push(Event{s, false, i}); // Arrival
        events.push(Event{p, true, i});  // Departure
    }

    // Process events
    set<int> available; // Available spots
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) available.insert(i);

    while (!events.empty()) {
        Event current = events.top();
        events.pop();

        if (current.is_departure) {
            // Car is leaving, free the spot
            if (results[current.car_index] != -1) { // Check if the car was parked
                available.insert(results[current.car_index]);
                if (current.time == T) {
                    parking[results[current.car_index]] = -1; // Vacate at time T
                }
            }
        } else {
            // Car is arriving, find a spot
            if (!available.empty()) {
                int spot = *available.begin();
                available.erase(available.begin());
                results[current.car_index] = spot;
                parking[spot] = current.car_index; // Store index of car in spot
            } else {
                results[current.car_index] = -1;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output results
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        out << (results[i] != -1 ? results[i] + 1 : -1) << "\n";
    }
    // Output final parking state
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        out << (parking[i] != -1 ? parking[i] + 1 : -1) << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This version of the program corrects the previous error by providing a custom comparison within the `Event` struct. The comparison is set up to make the `priority_queue` behave as a min-heap, prioritizing earlier events, with arrivals coming before departures, and lower-index cars being preferred. The `parking` array stores the indices of the cars parked at each spot, which is then translated to arrival times when outputting the final parking state. The `results` array tracks the parking spot (0-indexed) for each car, or `-1` if the car couldn't be parked. This code should now compile and produce the correct output.

The previous solution still has an issue with the order of processing arrivals and departures at the same time. It does not properly free up a parking spot before attempting to park a new car when both events happen at the same moment. Additionally, the output of the final parking state should show the arrival times, not the indices of the cars, and it was not updating the occupancy status correctly when cars leave at time `T`.

Let's correct these issues with the following logic:

1. Use a priority queue to process arrival and departure events in the correct order.
2. For each arrival event, attempt to park the car in the lowest-numbered available spot.
3. For each departure event, free the parking spot.
4. If a departure event occurs at time `T`, record the spot as empty.
5. At the end, output the arrival times of the cars that are still in the parking spots at time `T`.

Here is the updated and fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Event {
    int time;
    int car_index;
    bool is_departure;
};

// Comparator for the priority queue to sort events
struct EventCompare {
    bool operator()(const Event& a, const Event& b) const {
        if (a.time != b.time) return a.time > b.time; // Earlier time first
        if (a.is_departure != b.is_departure) return a.is_departure; // Arrivals first
        return a.car_index > b.car_index; // Smaller index first
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream in("parcare.in");
    ofstream out("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    in >> N >> M >> T;
    vector<int> arrivals(M), departures(M), parking(N, -1), final_parking(N, -1);
    priority_queue<Event, vector<Event>, EventCompare> events;

    // Read the arrival and departure times for each car
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        in >> arrivals[i] >> departures[i];
        events.push({arrivals[i], i, false}); // Arrival
        events.push({departures[i], i, true}); // Departure
    }

    set<int> available_spots;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) available_spots.insert(i);

    // Process events
    while (!events.empty()) {
        Event current = events.top();
        events.pop();
        int car_index = current.car_index;

        if (current.is_departure) {
            if (parking[car_index] != -1) { // If the car was parked
                if (current.time == T) final_parking[parking[car_index]] = -1; // Car leaves at closing time
                available_spots.insert(parking[car_index]);
            }
        } else {
            if (!available_spots.empty()) {
                int spot = *available_spots.begin();
                available_spots.erase(available_spots.begin());
                parking[car_index] = spot;
                final_parking[spot] = arrivals[car_index]; // Record the arrival time
            } else {
                parking[car_index] = -1;
            }
            out << (parking[car_index] != -1 ? parking[car_index] + 1 : -1) << '\n'; // Output the parking result
        }
    }

    // Output the final parking state
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        out << final_parking[i] << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now handle arrivals and departures correctly, ensuring that spots are freed before attempting to park a new car. The final output for each parking spot will display the arrival time of the car that is still parked at time `T`, or `-1` if the spot is empty.
