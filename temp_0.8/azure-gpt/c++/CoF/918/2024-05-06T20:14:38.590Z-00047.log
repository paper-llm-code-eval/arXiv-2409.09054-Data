    // Calculate positions and write to file
    Position firstMax = findSpiralMatrixEdge(n, (n / 2) * (n / 2), true);

    return 0;
}
```

This solution makes use of the fact that we know the length of the sequences we want: they are each one quarter of the total numbers (since the two sequences are of equal length and together they cover half the sequence). We only need to find the corners of the spirals to figure out where the sequences will start and end. The function `findSpiralMatrixEdge` takes into account the current direction of the spiral and calculates the position based on how far along the edge the sequence's last or first number would be. 

The input and output are handled with `fstream`, respecting the challenge's constraints.

The initial solution has an incorrect implementation of the `findSpiralMatrixEdge` function, which results in incorrect output. The primary issue lies in the calculation of the position coordinates and the understanding of the spiral's boundaries. We need to correctly identify the coordinates of the largest element of the first subsequence and the smallest element of the second subsequence within the spiraling path.

Considering the way the spiral is formed and the fact that the two subsequences are strictly defined—with the first one starting with 1 and the second one ending with $n^2$—we can leverage symmetry to find the positions of the required elements without traversing the entire matrix.

Let's correct the algorithm and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    long long totalNumbers = n * n;
    long long half = totalNumbers / 2;

    // First subsequence ends with the middle number of the total sequence
    long long endFirstSubsequence = (n % 2 == 0) ? half : (half + 1);

    // Positions for the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence
    long long x1, y1, x2, y2;

    // The largest term of the first subsequence is always at the bottom left corner of the matrix
    x1 = n;
    y1 = (n % 2 == 0) ? (n / 2) : (n / 2 + 1);

    // The smallest term of the second subsequence is always at the top right corner of the matrix
    x2 = (n % 2 == 0) ? (n / 2 + 1) : (n / 2 + 2);
    y2 = (n % 2 == 0) ? (n / 2) : (n / 2);

    fout << x1 << ' ' << y1 << '\n' << x2 << ' ' << y2;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the positions based on the observation that:
- For an odd-sized matrix ($n$ is odd), the largest term of the first subsequence (which contains 1) will be at the center of the bottom row, and the smallest term of the second subsequence (which contains $n^2$) will be just right of the center of the top row.
- For an even-sized matrix ($n$ is even), the largest term of the first subsequence will be at the center of the bottom row, and the smallest term of the second subsequence will be at the top row but one column to the right of the central position.

This approach is efficient since it doesn't involve any iteration over the matrix elements and directly calculates the required positions based on $n$.

The output of the previous solution does not match the expected output because of an incorrect assumption about the positions of the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence. Specifically, the assumption about the positions being based solely on the parity of `n` and their relation to the matrix center is incorrect.

To solve the spiral matrix challenge correctly, we need to carefully calculate the positions while considering the spiral traversal pattern. Once we have the number of terms in each subsequence, we must figure out the coordinates of these terms by simulating the traversal up to that point in the spiral.

Since we need the position of the largest term of the first subsequence, which is always at the end of the first half of the spiral, and the position of the smallest term of the second subsequence, which is always at the beginning of the second half, we can calculate these positions using the symmetry of the spiral pattern without needing to generate the whole matrix.

Let's correct the calculation by accounting for the spiral nature of traversal:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    // Calculate the number of terms in each subsequence
    long long half = (n * n) / 2;

    // Find out how many full layers we have
    long long layers = (n + 1) / 2;
    long long fullLayers = 0;
    long long layerStart = 1;

    // Each layer reduces the size of the side by 2
    for (long long size = n; size > 0; size -= 2) {
        long long layerEnd = layerStart + (size * 4) - 4;
        if (half <= layerEnd) {
            break;
        }
        layerStart = layerEnd + 1;
        fullLayers++;
    }

    // Calculate the number of terms in the full layers
    long long termsInFullLayers = (fullLayers * 2) * n - (4 * fullLayers * (fullLayers - 1));

    // Calculate positions based on remaining terms
    long long remainingTerms = half - termsInFullLayers;
    long long x1, y1, x2, y2;

    if (remainingTerms <= n - fullLayers * 2) {
        // The term is on the bottom row
        x1 = n - fullLayers;
        y1 = remainingTerms + fullLayers;
        // The term is at the start of the second half
        x2 = fullLayers + 1;
        y2 = n - fullLayers;
    } else {
        // The term is on the left-most column
        remainingTerms -= (n - fullLayers * 2);
        x1 = n - fullLayers - remainingTerms;
        y1 = fullLayers + 1;
        // The term is at the start of the second half
        x2 = fullLayers + 1 + remainingTerms;
        y2 = fullLayers + 1;
    }

    fout << x1 << ' ' << y1 << "\n" << x2 << ' ' << y2 << "\n";
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution considers the spiral traversal and calculates the positions of the desired elements by considering the number of terms in full layers and the remaining terms that lead to the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence. The solution assumes that the matrix starts with 1 at the top-left corner (1, 1) and increments as it spirals around.

The found output clearly indicates an issue with the calculation of the positions. The results are not reasonable as they include negative and out-of-bound indices for the matrix size given in the input.

One key observation to correct the approach is to recognize that for any odd-sized matrix (n is odd), the middle element will be $(n^2 + 1) / 2$. The first subsequence will contain this middle element, and therefore the largest term of the first subsequence will be exactly the middle element. For any even-sized matrix (n is even), the middle elements will be $n^2 / 2$ and $(n^2 / 2) + 1$, which belong to the first and second subsequence, respectively.

The term in the middle of the first subsequence (i.e., the largest term) will always be located at the bottom row of the upper-left quadrant of the matrix. Similarly, the smallest term of the second subsequence will always be located at the top row of the bottom-right quadrant.

Let's fix the solution by implementing the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

// Function to find the largest term of the first subsequence position.
std::pair<int, int> findFirstSubsequencePosition(long long n) {
    long long middle = (n * n + 1) / 2;
    long long ring = (n + 1) / 2; // The ring in which the middle element is located.
    long long sideLength = ring * 2 - 1; // The length of the side of the spiral at this ring.
    long long lowerLeftValue = sideLength * sideLength; // The value at the lower-left corner of the ring.

    // The distance from the lower left value to the middle.
    long long distanceToMiddle = lowerLeftValue - middle;

    // The position is on the bottom side of the ring, moving left from the lower-left corner.
    return {ring, sideLength - distanceToMiddle}; // 1-indexed.
}

// Function to find the smallest term of the second subsequence position.
std::pair<int, int> findSecondSubsequencePosition(long long n) {
    long long middle = (n * n) / 2 + 1;
    long long ring = n / 2 + 1; // The ring in which the middle element is located.
    long long upperRightValue = ring * ring * 4 - 4 * ring + 1; // The value at the upper-right corner of the ring.

    // The distance from the upper right value to the middle.
    long long distanceToMiddle = middle - upperRightValue;
    
    // The position is on the top side of the ring, moving right from the upper-right corner.
    return {n - ring + 1, ring - distanceToMiddle}; // 1-indexed.
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    // For the first subsequence, find the largest term's position.
    auto [x1, y1] = findFirstSubsequencePosition(n);
    
    // For the second subsequence, find the smallest term's position.
    auto [x2, y2] = findSecondSubsequencePosition(n);

    fout << x1 << ' ' << y1 << "\n" << x2 << ' ' << y2 << "\n";
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution calculates the positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence based on the number of elements in the matrix and their placement within the spiral rings. The corrected indices should now match the expected output.

The found output once again does not match the expected output, and the calculated positions have invalid negative and out-of-bounds values. The previous solution incorrectly calculated the ring and the distances to the middle values for both the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence.

To correct this and calculate the positions properly, we need to understand the spiral pattern and properly determine at which position the desired elements would be when traversing the matrix in a spiral pattern.

Given the spiral, we know that:
- The first subsequence will start at the top-left (1,1) and end somewhere in the middle of the spiral.
- The second subsequence will start right after the midpoint of the spiral and end at the bottom-right (n,n).

To find the position of the last element of the first subsequence and the first element of the second subsequence, we need to simulate the spiral traversal up to these points.

Let's implement a corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <utility>

std::pair<int, int> getPosition(long long n, long long target) {
    int layer = 0;
    long long current = 1;
    long long layer_max = n * n;
    
    while (layer_max - (layer * 8) >= target) {
        layer_max -= (layer * 8);
        layer++;
    }
    
    int x = n - layer;
    int y = layer + 1;
    
    if (target <= layer_max - ((n - (2 * layer)) - 1)) {
        y += (target - (layer_max - (n - (2 * layer)) + 1));
    } else {
        y += (n - (2 * layer)) - 1;
        layer_max -= ((n - (2 * layer)) - 1);
        if (target <= layer_max - ((n - (2 * layer)) - 1)) {
            x -= (target - (layer_max - (n - (2 * layer)) + 1));
        } else {
            x -= (n - (2 * layer)) - 1;
            layer_max -= ((n - (2 * layer)) - 1);
            y -= (target - layer_max);
        }
    }
    return {x, y};
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    long long totalNumbers = n * n;
    long long half = totalNumbers / 2;

    // Find the position of the largest term in the first subsequence.
    std::pair<int, int> firstMax = getPosition(n, half);

    // Due to symmetry, we can infer the position of the smallest term in the second
    // subsequence as it will be the mirror image of the first sequence's last term
    // with respect to the matrix's center line.
    std::pair<int, int> secondMin = firstMax;
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        secondMin.first += 1; // Move down one row.
    } else {
        secondMin.second -= 1; // Move left one column.
    }

    fout << firstMax.first << ' ' << firstMax.second << '\n';
    fout << secondMin.first << ' ' << secondMin.second << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly implement the calculation of the positions for both the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence by simulating the spiral traversal and taking advantage of the symmetry for the second subsequence position. The solution considers the input constraints and avoids unnecessary matrix generation for better performance.

The found output indicates that the positions calculated are incorrect and result in negative indices, which are not valid for matrix coordinates. The error lies in the logic of the `getPosition` function, where the calculations for the layer traversal and subsequent position adjustments do not correctly reflect the spiral traversal pattern.

To fix the solution, we need to correctly simulate the traversal in a spiral pattern and find the matrix indices for the required positions.

Let's simplify the problem by breaking it down:

1. The first half of the spiral ends at the midpoint, which is `n^2 / 2` for even `n`, and `(n^2 + 1) / 2` for odd `n`.
2. Due to the symmetry of the problem, for an odd `n`, the largest term of the first subsequence will be on the bottom border of the first half of the spiral, and the smallest term of the second subsequence will be on the top border of the second half of the spiral. For an even `n`, the smallest term of the second subsequence will be exactly one position to the right of the largest term of the first subsequence.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    // Calculate the midpoint of the spiral sequence
    long long midpoint = (n % 2 == 0) ? (n * n / 2) : ((n * n + 1) / 2);

    // Calculate the layer of the midpoint
    long long layer = (long long)ceil((double)n / 2.0);

    // The side length of the layer where the midpoint is located
    long long side_length = 2 * layer - 1;

    // Calculate the position of the midpoint in the spiral pattern
    long long row_mid = layer;
    long long col_mid = layer;

    // Calculate the largest term of the first subsequence position
    long long first_seq_largest_term = midpoint;
    long long row_first = n - ((first_seq_largest_term - 1) / side_length);
    long long col_first = n - layer + 1;

    // Calculate the smallest term of the second subsequence position
    long long second_seq_smallest_term = midpoint + 1;
    long long row_second, col_second;

    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        // Even n, the position just moves one column to the right
        row_second = row_first;
        col_second = col_first + 1;
    } else {
        // Odd n, the position moves to the top border of the second half of the spiral
        row_second = row_first - 1;
        col_second = col_first;
    }

    fout << row_first << ' ' << col_first << '\n';
    fout << row_second << ' ' << col_second << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the positions for the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence based on the midpoint of the spiral and its symmetry.

The output is incorrect because the logic for determining the positions of the largest term of the first subsequence and the smallest term of the second subsequence is flawed. The approach to calculate the layer and positions directly from the midpoint is incorrect for the spiral traversal pattern.

We can solve the problem by following these steps:

1. Determine the length of the side of the matrix spiral that the last element of the first subsequence and the first element of the second subsequence would lie on. This can be done by considering that each concentric square (layer) of the spiral adds $(2k - 1)^2$ elements to the count, where $k$ is the layer number starting from the center.

2. From the total count of elements up to the end of the first half (or the beginning of the second half), we subtract the counts of the full layers to find out where within the partial layer the elements lie.

3. Once we know the position within the partial layer, we can determine the coordinates in the matrix by considering the direction of the spiral and whether we are on the top, right, bottom, or left side of the layer.

Let's rewrite the solution with these steps in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    // The total number of elements in the matrix is n^2
    // The last element of the first subsequence is at n^2/2 for even n,
    // and at (n^2+1)/2 for odd n. The first element of the second subsequence
    // immediately follows it.

    long long half = (n % 2 == 0) ? (n * n / 2) : ((n * n + 1) / 2);
    long long first_seq_last = half;
    long long second_seq_first = half + 1;

    // Determine the layer in which the last element of the first subsequence lies
    long long side = n;
    long long elements = side * side; // Elements in the full square up to current side length
    long long layer = 0;

    while (elements > first_seq_last) {
        layer++;
        side -= 2;
        elements = side * side;
    }

    // Calculate the position of the last element of the first subsequence
    // starting from the top-right corner of the current layer
    long long x1 = layer + 1;
    long long y1 = n - layer;
    long long remaining = first_seq_last - elements;

    if (remaining < side) {
        y1 -= remaining;
    } else {
        y1 -= (side - 1);
        remaining -= (side - 1);
        x1 += remaining;
    }

    // The first element of the second subsequence is always below the last element
    // of the first subsequence by one for odd n, and to the right by one for even n
    long long x2 = (n % 2 == 0) ? x1 : (x1 + 1);
    long long y2 = (n % 2 == 0) ? (y1 + 1) : y1;

    fout << x1 << ' ' << y1 << '\n';
    fout << x2 << ' ' << y2 << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly calculate the positions of the two elements in question by simulating the traversal in layers and taking into account the direction of the spiral and its boundaries. The coordinates should now match the expected output for the given input.
