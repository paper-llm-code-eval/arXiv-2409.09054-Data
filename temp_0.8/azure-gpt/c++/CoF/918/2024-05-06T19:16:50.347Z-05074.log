This solution calculates the position of the elements without actually building the matrix or the spiral sequence, which makes it very efficient. The calculation is based on the observation that the largest number in the first subsequence and the smallest number in the second subsequence are at specific positions that relate to the "rings" formed by the spiral. These positions can be derived from the value of `n` and the properties of the square numbers, exploiting the symmetry of the spiral.

The initial solution has a flaw in the logic used to determine the positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence. Let's analyze the problem and come up with a corrected version of the solution.

We know that the matrix is filled in a spiral starting from the top-left corner going clockwise. We also know that the first subsequence must start with 1 and the second subsequence must end with $n^2$. The first subsequence will always end somewhere on the top or left edge of the matrix (depending on whether $n$ is even or odd), while the second will start on the bottom or right edge.

For the first subsequence, if $n$ is odd, it will end on the left edge, and if $n$ is even, it will end on the top edge. For the second subsequence, if $n$ is odd, it will start on the bottom edge, and if $n$ is even, it will start on the right edge.

Now, let's fix the logic to correctly calculate the output based on these observations:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    long long ring, x1, y1, x2, y2;

    // Calculate the ring number, where the middle element is (ring, ring).
    ring = (n - 1) / 2;

    if (n % 2 == 1) {
        // For odd n, the first subsequence ends on the left edge and the second starts on the bottom edge.
        x1 = n - ring;
        y1 = ring + 1;
        x2 = ring + 2;
        y2 = n - ring;
    } else {
        // For even n, the first subsequence ends on the top edge and the second starts on the right edge.
        x1 = ring + 1;
        y1 = n - ring;
        x2 = n - ring;
        y2 = ring + 1;
    }

    // Output the result
    fout << x1 << " " << y1 << std::endl;
    fout << x2 << " " << y2 << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution takes into account whether $n$ is odd or even to determine the correct positions of the elements in the spiraled matrix, and should produce the expected output.

The last solution provided still doesn't give the expected results, which indicates a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements. The issue lies in incorrectly calculating the positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence.

The spiral traversal is a bit tricky because the direction changes after traversing each edge. The crux of the problem is to determine the position of the middle element of the spiral sequence without generating the whole sequence or matrix. The middle element effectively splits the sequence into two halves. For odd $n$, the first half ends on the left edge, and the second half starts at the bottom edge. For even $n$, the first half ends on the top edge, and the second half starts on the right edge.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and implement a correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    // The middle value is the last number of the first subsequence
    long long middle = (n * n + 1) / 2;

    long long layer = (n + 1) / 2; // Layer of the middle value
    long long maxFirst, maxFirstX, maxFirstY;
    long long minSecond, minSecondX, minSecondY;

    // Calculate the position of the largest number in the first subsequence
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        // Even case: top row, moving towards right
        maxFirstX = layer;
        maxFirstY = layer - (middle - ((layer - 1) * n + 1));
    } else {
        // Odd case: left column, moving down
        maxFirstX = n - layer + 1;
        maxFirstY = layer;
    }

    // Calculate the position of the smallest number in the second subsequence
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        // Even case: on the rightmost column, moving down
        minSecondX = layer;
        minSecondY = n - layer + 1;
    } else {
        // Odd case: on the bottom row, moving towards right
        minSecondX = layer;
        minSecondY = layer + (middle - (n * (layer - 1) + layer));
    }

    // Output the result
    fout << maxFirstX << " " << maxFirstY << std::endl;
    fout << minSecondX << " " << minSecondY << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we first find the middle value of the sequence, which allows us to separate the sequence into two halves. Then we calculate the correct positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence based on the parity of $n$. This corrected logic should yield the expected results.

The previously provided solution did not yield the expected output due to incorrect calculations of the positions for the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence. We need to carefully consider the pattern in which the spiral fills the matrix and determine the positions based on the layout of the spiral.

A key observation for this problem is that the spiral advances layer by layer from the outside towards the center. Each layer consists of a top row, right column, bottom row, and left column. For a given $n$, if we can determine the layer at which the sequence's midpoint (halfway between 1 and $n^2$) falls, we can then ascertain the position of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence.

Let's correct the logic and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    // Determine the layer (distance from the outermost edge) for the middle value.
    // Start by calculating the total number of layers.
    long long totalLayers = (n + 1) / 2;
    long long middleValue = (n * n + 1) / 2;
    // Calculate the side length of the square that contains the middle value.
    long long sideLength = (long long)ceil(sqrt((double)middleValue));
    // If sideLength is even, we need to move to the next odd square.
    if (sideLength % 2 == 0) {
        sideLength++;
    }
    // Number of layers from the middle value to the outer edge.
    long long middleLayers = (sideLength - 1) / 2;
    // Calculate the position of the middle value within its layer.
    long long positionInLayer = middleValue - (sideLength - 2) * (sideLength - 2);

    long long x1, y1, x2, y2;

    // Calculate the row and column for the largest term in the first subsequence.
    if (positionInLayer <= sideLength - 1) {
        // The largest term is on the top edge of its layer.
        x1 = totalLayers - middleLayers;
        y1 = totalLayers - middleLayers + positionInLayer;
    } else {
        // The largest term is on the left edge of its layer.
        positionInLayer -= (sideLength - 1);
        x1 = totalLayers - middleLayers + positionInLayer;
        y1 = totalLayers - middleLayers;
    }

    // Calculate the row and column for the smallest term in the second subsequence.
    // We can determine its position by starting from the middle value and going backwards.
    long long middleValueForSecondSubseq = middleValue - 1;
    sideLength = (long long)ceil(sqrt((double)middleValueForSecondSubseq));
    if (sideLength % 2 == 0) {
        sideLength++;
    }
    middleLayers = (sideLength - 1) / 2;
    positionInLayer = middleValueForSecondSubseq - (sideLength - 2) * (sideLength - 2);

    if (positionInLayer <= sideLength - 1) {
        // The smallest term is on the right edge of its layer.
        x2 = totalLayers - middleLayers + positionInLayer;
        y2 = totalLayers + middleLayers;
    } else {
        // The smallest term is on the bottom edge of its layer.
        positionInLayer -= (sideLength - 1);
        x2 = totalLayers + middleLayers;
        y2 = totalLayers + middleLayers - positionInLayer;
    }

    // Output the result.
    fout << x1 << " " << y1 << std::endl;
    fout << x2 << " " << y2 << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we first determine the layer number for the middle value of the entire sequence. Then, we calculate the position of the largest term in the first subsequence by identifying its location within its layer (top or left edge). We perform similar steps to find the smallest term in the second subsequence, but this time we consider that its position will be on the right or bottom edge. This corrected logic should now yield the expected output.

My apologies for the confusion earlier. The issue with the previous code is that it does not accurately calculate the positions of the elements based on the spiral traversal pattern.

Let's re-examine the spiral pattern and rewrite the solution. We need to consider the directions the spiral takes and the fact that when $n$ is odd, the spiral ends at the center of the matrix, and when $n$ is even, it ends one position left of the center. For $n^2 / 2$, when $n$ is odd, the position is at the bottom center, and when $n$ is even, it is at the center-right.

The corrected solution is as follows:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <utility>

// Function to calculate the position of a given 1-indexed number in the spiral
std::pair<long long, long long> spiral_position(long long n, long long target) {
    long long layer = (n - 1) / 2; // Determine the layer in which the target resides
    long long sector_size = 2 * layer; // Calculate the size of each sector in the current layer
    long long layer_start = n * n - (n - 2 * layer) * (n - 2 * layer) + 1; // Number at the start of the layer
    long long offset = target - layer_start;
    
    // Determine which side of the layer the target resides on and its offset within that side
    long long side = offset / sector_size; // 0 for top, 1 for right, 2 for bottom, 3 for left
    long long side_offset = offset % sector_size;
    
    long long row, col;
    switch (side) {
        case 0: // Top side
            row = layer + 1;
            col = n - layer + side_offset;
            break;
        case 1: // Right side
            row = layer + 1 + side_offset;
            col = n - layer;
            break;
        case 2: // Bottom side
            row = n - layer;
            col = n - layer - side_offset;
            break;
        case 3: // Left side
            row = n - layer - side_offset;
            col = layer + 1;
            break;
    }
    return {row, col};
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");
    
    long long n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();
    
    long long half_n_squared = (n % 2 == 0) ? n * n / 2 : (n * n + 1) / 2;
    long long upper_half = (n % 2 == 0) ? half_n_squared : half_n_squared - n / 2;
    long long lower_half = half_n_squared + 1;
    
    // Get the positions of the largest number in the first subsequence
    // and the smallest number in the second subsequence
    std::pair<long long, long long> upper_pos = spiral_position(n, upper_half);
    std::pair<long long, long long> lower_pos = spiral_position(n, lower_half);

    // Output the result
    fout << upper_pos.first << " " << upper_pos.second << std::endl;
    fout << lower_pos.first << " " << lower_pos.second << std::endl;
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the position of the middle element and the elements at $n^2 / 2$ and $(n^2 + 1) / 2$ correctly, considering the spiral traversal. With the above logic, the positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence should be accurately determined.

It seems the previous solution has an error, as the result is not the expected output. Let me provide a correct solution to address the issue.

The key to this problem is to understand that the first sub-sequence, which includes the number 1, will always end on the top row or the leftmost column, and the second sub-sequence, which includes the number $n^2$, will always start on the bottom row or the rightmost column. Therefore, we need to find the location where the first sub-sequence ends and the second sub-sequence starts.

Given that both sub-sequences are of equal length, they are separated by the midpoint of the spiral, which is the value $(n^2 + 1)/2$. We can analyze the pattern of the spiral to determine the position of this midpoint value. The pattern repeatedly decreases the size of the sides by two as we move inward through the layers of the spiral.

Now, let's rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

std::pair<int, int> position(int n, int target) {
    int layer = (n - 1) / 2;  // Calculate which layer the target is in
    int legLength = layer * 2; // The length of a side for the current layer's square
    int maxValLayer = (n - layer) * (n - layer); // The maximum value in the current layer

    // Determine the side (top, right, bottom, left) of the layer the target is on
    int side = (maxValLayer - target) / legLength;
    // Determine the position within the side of the layer
    int offset = (maxValLayer - target) % legLength;

    int row = 0, col = 0;
    switch (side) {
        case 0: // Target is on the bottom side
            row = n - layer;
            col = n - layer - offset;
            break;
        case 1: // Target is on the left side
            row = n - layer - offset;
            col = layer + 1;
            break;
        case 2: // Target is on the top side
            row = layer + 1;
            col = layer + 1 + offset;
            break;
        case 3: // Target is on the right side
            row = layer + 1 + offset;
            col = n - layer;
            break;
    }
    return {row, col};
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("spiralmatrix.in");
    std::ofstream fout("spiralmatrix.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    int mid = (n * n + 1) / 2; // Midpoint of the sequence

    // Find the position of the largest term in the first subsequence
    std::pair<int, int> maxFirstSubseqPos = position(n, mid - 1);
    // Find the position of the smallest term in the second subsequence
    std::pair<int, int> minSecondSubseqPos = position(n, mid);

    // Output the result
    fout << maxFirstSubseqPos.first << " " << maxFirstSubseqPos.second << "\n";
    fout << minSecondSubseqPos.first << " " << minSecondSubseqPos.second << "\n";
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the position of the midpoint value $(n^2 + 1)/2$ and uses it to determine the positions of the largest term in the first subsequence and the smallest term in the second subsequence. The calculations take into account the layer in which these values reside and the pattern of the spiral.
