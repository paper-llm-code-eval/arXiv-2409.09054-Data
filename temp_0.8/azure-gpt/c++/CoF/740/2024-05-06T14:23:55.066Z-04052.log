Se dă numărul natural $k$. Dorim să obţinem un tablou unidimensional $a$, cu elemente naturale constituite astfel: $a_1 =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_1$ este cifra sutelor produsului $k \cdot k$, iar cifra unităţilor lui $a_1$ este cifra zecilor produsului $k \cdot k$).

Pentru $i > 1$, $a_i$ se obţine astfel: $a_i =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra sutelor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$, iar cifra unităţilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra zecilor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$).

Procesul de generare a termenilor tabloului se încheie în momentul când este generat un număr ce a mai fost generat înainte. Ultimul număr (cel ce se repetă) nu face parte din tablou.

Este posibil ca numerele numite în text ca fiind de “două cifre” să aibă de fapt doar o cifră, în cazul în care cifra zecilor lor este $0$; ele pot fi chiar şi $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care:

1. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut;
2. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut, dar sortate crescător după prima lor cifră (cea mai din stânga).

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găsește $k$.

# Date de ieșire

* Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea generării lor, separate de un spaţiu.
* Pe a doua linie se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea cerută la cerinţa a doua; elementele vor fi separate de câte un spaţiu

# Restricții și precizări

* $11 \leq k \leq 999$;
* La cerinţa a doua: dacă două sau mai multe elemente din tabloul $a$ au aceeaşi primă cifră, atunci aceste elemente se pot afişa în orice ordine ce respectă cerinţa. În exemplul de mai jos, afişarea pentru cerinţa a doua putea fi şi sub forma: $0 \ 2 \ 25 \ 5 \ 62 \ 84$, adică am interschimbat $2$ cu $25$, pentru că ambele au prima cifră $2$ în acest caz, alte posibilităţi de afişare nu mai sunt.
* Pentru prima cerinţă rezolvată corect se atribuie $60\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru a doua, încă $40\%$ din punctaj.

To test the correctness and the efficiency of this program, it should be compiled and run with a variety of inputs, including the limits of the problem constraints. The primary focus for efficiency should be on processing the sequence generation and the sorting algorithm. The use of file streams without unnecessary synchronization with C-style I/O (by calling `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`) and not using `std::endl` (which forces a flush of the stream buffer) can provide minor performance improvements. However, the most significant gains will come from optimizing the logic and algorithms used within the program.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found result in the sorting lies in the custom comparator function used for sorting the sequence. The `sort` call uses a lambda function to sort elements by comparing their tens digit first, which is correct, but the condition for numbers with the same tens digit isn't precise. The expected output specifies that the order between numbers with the same tens digit is irrelevant, which means the secondary sorting by the units digit is unnecessary and actually incorrect.

We need to modify the comparator to only consider the tens digit for sorting. If two numbers have the same tens digit, they are considered equivalent, and their order does not need to be altered. This change ensures that the sorting algorithm is stable, maintaining the original order of elements when their sorted positions are equivalent.

Here's the corrected code with the necessary adjustments:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");

    unsigned int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();

    std::vector<unsigned int> sequence;
    std::vector<unsigned int> sortedSequence;

    unsigned int a = ((k * k) / 10) % 100; // Initial a
    sequence.push_back(a);

    // Generate the sequence
    std::vector<bool> visited(100, false);
    visited[a] = true;
    while (true) {
        a = ((a * a) / 10) % 100;
        if (visited[a]) break;
        visited[a] = true;
        sequence.push_back(a);
    }

    // Copy the sequence for sorting
    sortedSequence = sequence;

    // Custom comparator for sorting by the tens digit only
    std::stable_sort(sortedSequence.begin(), sortedSequence.end(), [](unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
        return (a / 10) < (b / 10);
    });

    // Output the sequences
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        out << sequence[i];
        if (i < sequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    for (size_t i = 0; i < sortedSequence.size(); ++i) {
        out << sortedSequence[i];
        if (i < sortedSequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should produce the expected output by sorting the elements based only on their tens digit and maintaining the original order for elements with the same tens digit. Moreover, I've used `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` to avoid flushing the output buffer unnecessarily, which can lead to better performance.

The difference between the expected and found output is due to the sorting logic in the implementation. The second line of the output should have the elements sorted based on their first (left-most) digit, which is the tens digit for numbers with two digits and is 0 for numbers with only one digit. In the current implementation, I used a `stable_sort` with a comparator that only considered the tens digit. However, it seems that this strategy didn't maintain the exact order we need, possibly due to the stable sorting behavior when the tens digits are the same.

To resolve this, we need to write a comparator that considers single-digit numbers to have a tens digit of 0, ensuring they appear first in the sorted output, and then sorts the rest of the numbers based on their tens digit as before. 

Here's the revised code with the fixed sorting logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    unsigned int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();

    std::vector<unsigned int> sortedSequence;
    unsigned int a = ((k * k) / 10) % 100; // Initial a
    sequence.push_back(a);
    std::vector<bool> visited(100, false);
    visited[a] = true;

    // Generate the sequence
    while (true) {
        a = ((a * a) / 10) % 100; // Compute next term
        if (visited[a]) break; // Stop if term is repeated
        sequence.push_back(a);
        visited[a] = true; // Mark as visited
    }

    // Sort the sequence for the second requirement
    sortedSequence = sequence;
    std::sort(sortedSequence.begin(), sortedSequence.end(), [](unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
        int first_digit_a = (a >= 10) ? (a / 10) : 0;
        int first_digit_b = (b >= 10) ? (b / 10) : 0;
        return first_digit_a < first_digit_b;
    });

    // Output the sequences
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        out << sequence[i];
        if (i < sequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sortedSequence.size(); ++i) {
        out << sortedSequence[i];
        if (i < sortedSequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```
This implementation should now correctly sort single-digit numbers before others based on the assumption that their tens digit is 0. The result should match the expected output, with single-digit numbers appearing first in the sorted list, followed by the two-digit numbers sorted by their tens digit.

The discrepancy arises because the sorting criteria employed in the previous code do not account for the fact that single-digit numbers should be treated as having a leading zero and should precede other numbers when sorting by the first digit. Since the requirement is to sort the numbers by their first (most significant) digit without considering their second digit, we need to adjust the logic to ensure single-digit numbers are correctly prioritized.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");

    unsigned int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();

    std::vector<unsigned int> sequence;
    std::vector<unsigned int> sortedSequence;

    unsigned int a = ((k * k) / 10) % 100; // Initial a
    sequence.push_back(a);

    // Generate the sequence
    std::vector<bool> visited(100, false);
    visited[a] = true;
    while (true) {
        a = ((a * a) / 10) % 100;
        if (visited[a]) break;
        visited[a] = true;
        sequence.push_back(a);
    }

    // Copy the sequence for sorting
    sortedSequence = sequence;

    // Custom comparator for sorting by the first digit
    std::sort(sortedSequence.begin(), sortedSequence.end(), [](unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
        if (a < 10) a *= 10; // Treat single-digit as having a leading zero
        if (b < 10) b *= 10; // Treat single-digit as having a leading zero
        return a < b;
    });

    // Output the sequences
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        out << sequence[i];
        if (i < sequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    for (size_t i = 0; i < sortedSequence.size(); ++i) {
        out << sortedSequence[i];
        if (i < sortedSequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should produce the expected output by temporarily treating single-digit numbers as if they had a leading zero during the comparison, thereby ensuring they are sorted correctly as per the first digit. Other numbers are compared as they are. The output should match the specified expected output in the challenge.

The problem arises from the sorting condition, which doesn't correctly handle single-digit numbers. The expected output requires that the sequence be sorted by the first digit, where single-digit numbers should be treated as having a leading zero. The current sorting comparator does not sort single-digit numbers before two-digit numbers correctly, hence the output is incorrect.

I will correct this by modifying the sorting condition so that numbers are sorted by the first digit, considering single-digit numbers to have a leading zero. Additionally, I'll ensure we're not modifying the value of the numbers, just their comparison order.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    unsigned int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();

    std::vector<unsigned int> sequence;
    unsigned int a = ((k * k) / 10) % 100; // Initial a
    sequence.push_back(a);

    // Generate the sequence
    bool visited[100] = {false};
    visited[a] = true;
    while (true) {
        a = ((a * a) / 10) % 100; // Compute next term
        if (visited[a]) break; // Stop if term is repeated
        sequence.push_back(a);
        visited[a] = true; // Mark as visited
    }

    // Sort the sequence for the second requirement
    std::sort(sequence.begin(), sequence.end(), [](unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
        // Treat numbers as if they all have two digits, with a leading zero for single-digit numbers
        int leadingA = a < 10 ? 0 : a / 10;
        int leadingB = b < 10 ? 0 : b / 10;
        return leadingA < leadingB;
    });

    // Output the sequences
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    for (auto it = sequence.begin(); it != sequence.end(); ++it) {
        if (it != sequence.begin()) {
            out << ' ';
        }
        out << *it;
    }
    out << '\n';

    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (auto it = sequence.begin(); it != sequence.end(); ++it) {
        if (it != sequence.begin()) {
            out << ' '; // Space separator
        }
        out << *it;
    }
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The corrected code uses a custom sorting condition that correctly places single-digit numbers before two-digit numbers by imagining a leading zero for single-digit numbers. The sorted sequence output is then written to the output file. The sort is performed only once since there's no need to maintain the original order and the sorted order at the same time. The original sequence is overwritten with the sorted sequence, which is then written out to the file. This should now give the expected output.

The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `sort` function within the `std` namespace. The most likely reason for this is that we forgot to include the header file that contains the definition for `std::sort`, which is `<algorithm>`.

To fix this issue, we need to include the `<algorithm>` header at the beginning of the program. Here is the corrected source code with the necessary `#include` directive:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // Include for std::sort

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    unsigned int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();

    std::vector<unsigned int> sequence;
    unsigned int a = ((k * k) / 10) % 100; // Initial a
    sequence.push_back(a);
    bool visited[100] = {false};
    visited[a] = true;
    
    // Generate the sequence
    while (true) {
        a = ((a * a) / 10) % 100; // Compute next term
        if (visited[a]) break; // Stop if term is repeated
        sequence.push_back(a);
        visited[a] = true; // Mark as visited
    }

    // Create a copy of the sequence for sorting
    std::vector<unsigned int> sortedSequence(sequence);

    // Sort the copied sequence for the second requirement
    std::sort(sortedSequence.begin(), sortedSequence.end(), [](unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
        // Treat numbers as if they all have two digits, with a leading zero for single-digit numbers
        int leadingA = a < 10 ? 0 : a / 10;
        int leadingB = b < 10 ? 0 : b / 10;
        return leadingA < leadingB;
    });

    // Output the original sequence
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {
        out << sequence[i];
        if (i < sequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sortedSequence.size(); i++) {
        out << sortedSequence[i];
        if (i < sortedSequence.size() - 1) out << ' ';
    }
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

With the inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header, the program should now compile successfully and perform the sorting as expected. This should resolve the compilation error and produce the correct output when the program is executed.

The error lies in the custom sorting criterion provided to `std::sort`. The comparator should prioritize numbers with the lower first digit, and the code currently treats single-digit numbers as if they have a leading zero, which is correct. However, the problem with the current code is that it inadvertently sorts two numbers with the same first digit in ascending order of their entire value, leading to the incorrect order in the output file.

According to the given problem constraints, the order among numbers with the same first digit does not have to change. To maintain the order of numbers with the same first digit, we should use a stable sorting algorithm that preserves the relative order of equal elements. 

We will use `std::stable_sort` instead of `std::sort` and modify the comparator to only compare the first digit.

Here's the entire fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    unsigned int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();

    std::vector<unsigned int> sequence;
    unsigned int a = ((k * k) / 10) % 100; // Calculate the first number a1
    sequence.push_back(a);

    // Generate the sequence
    bool visited[100] = {false}; // Initialize all to false
    visited[a] = true;

    while (true) {
        a = ((a * a) / 10) % 100; // Compute next term
        if (visited[a]) break; // Stop if this number was already generated
        sequence.push_back(a);
        visited[a] = true; // Mark this number as generated
    }

    // Create a copy of the sequence for sorting
    std::vector<unsigned int> sortedSequence(sequence);

    // Use stable_sort to sort the copied sequence without altering the relative order of equal elements
    std::stable_sort(sortedSequence.begin(), sortedSequence.end(), [](unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
        int digitA = a < 10 ? 0 : a / 10; // Calculate the first digit or assume 0 if single-digit
        int digitB = b < 10 ? 0 : b / 10;
        return digitA < digitB;
    });

    // Open output file
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");

    // Output the original sequence
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {
        out << sequence[i];
        if (i + 1 < sequence.size()) out << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';

    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sortedSequence.size(); i++) {
        out << sortedSequence[i];
        if (i + 1 < sortedSequence.size()) out << ' ';
    }

    // Close output file
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now produce the correct output, as `std::stable_sort` maintains the order of elements that are considered equivalent by the comparator. The comparator is designed to compare only the first digit for sorting, which should meet the problem's requirements and match the expected output.
