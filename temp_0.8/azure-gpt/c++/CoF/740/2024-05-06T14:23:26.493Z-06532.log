Se dă numărul natural $k$. Dorim să obţinem un tablou unidimensional $a$, cu elemente naturale constituite astfel: $a_1 =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_1$ este cifra sutelor produsului $k \cdot k$, iar cifra unităţilor lui $a_1$ este cifra zecilor produsului $k \cdot k$).

Pentru $i > 1$, $a_i$ se obţine astfel: $a_i =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra sutelor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$, iar cifra unităţilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra zecilor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$).

Procesul de generare a termenilor tabloului se încheie în momentul când este generat un număr ce a mai fost generat înainte. Ultimul număr (cel ce se repetă) nu face parte din tablou.

Este posibil ca numerele numite în text ca fiind de “două cifre” să aibă de fapt doar o cifră, în cazul în care cifra zecilor lor este $0$; ele pot fi chiar şi $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care:

1. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut;
2. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut, dar sortate crescător după prima lor cifră (cea mai din stânga).

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găsește $k$.

# Date de ieșire

* Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea generării lor, separate de un spaţiu.
* Pe a doua linie se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea cerută la cerinţa a doua; elementele vor fi separate de câte un spaţiu

# Restricții și precizări

* $11 \leq k \leq 999$;
* La cerinţa a doua: dacă două sau mai multe elemente din tabloul $a$ au aceeaşi primă cifră, atunci aceste elemente se pot afişa în orice ordine ce respectă cerinţa. În exemplul de mai jos, afişarea pentru cerinţa a doua putea fi şi sub forma: $0 \ 2 \ 25 \ 5 \ 62 \ 84$, adică am interschimbat $2$ cu $25$, pentru că ambele au prima cifră $2$ în acest caz, alte posibilităţi de afişare nu mai sunt.
* Pentru prima cerinţă rezolvată corect se atribuie $60\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru a doua, încă $40\%$ din punctaj.

It avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, and `scanf()` for I/O operations, and uses `ifstream` and `ofstream` for file reading and writing, respectively.

The difference between the expected and found result lies in the sorting algorithm. My initial sorting function considered both the first digit and the entire number for ordering, which caused numbers with the same first digit to be further sorted by their entire value. However, the task requires that if two elements have the same first digit, they can be displayed in any order as long as the order of the first digits is correct.

To fix this, we should modify the sorting function to consider only the first digit (i.e., the tens place of the number) and ignore the second digit if the first digits are the same.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    
    int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();
    
    std::vector<int> elements;
    std::vector<int> seen(100, 0);
    
    // Calculate a_1
    int a = ((k * k) % 1000) / 10;
    
    // Generate the sequence
    while (!seen[a]) {
        seen[a] = 1;
        elements.push_back(a);
        a = ((a * a) % 1000) / 10;
    }
    
    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";
    
    // Sort the sequence by the first digit only
    std::sort(elements.begin(), elements.end(), [](int left, int right) {
        return (left / 10) < (right / 10);
    });
    
    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

The `std::sort` function now only compares the first digit of each element for sorting, which will correctly order elements according to their first digits and fulfill the requirement of the challenge. The second digits are not considered in the comparison, allowing elements with the same first digit to appear in any order, as long as the first digits are sorted correctly.

The difference between the expected and found result is due to incorrect handling of elements with a single digit in the sorting algorithm. In the provided solution, the sorting algorithm only considers the tens digit for sorting, but does not correctly handle single-digit numbers (where the tens digit is implicitly 0). This causes the single-digit numbers to be placed after the two-digit numbers with a tens digit of 0, leading to incorrect output order.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the sorting algorithm to handle single-digit numbers by effectively treating them as if they had a tens digit of 0. Additionally, we should maintain the original order for numbers with the same first digit, which requires a stable sort.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    
    int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();
    
    std::vector<int> elements;
    std::vector<int> seen(100, 0);
    
    // Calculate a_1
    int a = ((k * k) % 1000) / 10;
    
    // Generate the sequence
    while (!seen[a]) {
        seen[a] = 1;
        elements.push_back(a);
        a = ((a * a) % 1000) / 10;
    }
    
    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";
    
    // Sort the sequence by the first digit only, using stable_sort to preserve relative order
    std::stable_sort(elements.begin(), elements.end(), [](int left, int right) {
        int left_first_digit = left / 10 ? left / 10 : left;
        int right_first_digit = right / 10 ? right / 10 : right;
        return left_first_digit < right_first_digit;
    });
    
    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This updated solution uses `std::stable_sort` instead of `std::sort` to maintain the relative order of elements with the same first digit. The lambda function for comparison has been modified to correctly compare single-digit numbers by treating them as having a tens digit of 0. The program should now produce the correct output as expected.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. After reviewing the problem again, I've noticed an error in the sorting logic. When sorting the numbers by their first digit, indeed, single-digit numbers (which are effectively prefixed by a '0') should appear before other two-digit numbers starting with any non-zero digit.

However, the expected output also indicates that elements with the same first digit should be sorted based on their second digit. In other words, '2' should come before '25' because '2' is considered '02', and '0' is less than '5'.

Let's rewrite the comparison function to correctly sort by the first digit, treating single-digit numbers as if they had an additional '0' in front.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    
    int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();
    
    std::vector<int> elements;
    std::vector<bool> seen(100, false);
    
    // Calculate a_1
    int a = ((k * k) % 1000) / 10;
    
    // Generate the sequence
    while (!seen[a]) {
        seen[a] = true;
        elements.push_back(a);
        a = ((a * a) % 1000) / 10;
    }
    
    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";
    
    // Sort the sequence by considering single-digit numbers as '0x'
    std::sort(elements.begin(), elements.end(), [](int left, int right) {
        int left_tens = left / 10;
        int right_tens = right / 10;
        // If tens digit is the same or both numbers are single-digit
        if (left_tens == right_tens) {
            return left < right; // Compare as whole numbers
        }
        // Otherwise, compare by the tens digit, treating single digits as '0'
        return (left_tens == 0 ? 0 : left_tens) < (right_tens == 0 ? 0 : right_tens);
    });
    
    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution includes a comparison function that correctly sorts single-digit and two-digit numbers by their first digit and then by their second digit if the first digits are equal. It should now output the correct sorted sequence according to the problem's requirements.

Upon review of the expected output and the found output, it appears that the sorting is not done correctly. The results differ because the program does not properly handle the sorting of single-digit numbers against two-digit numbers when considering the first digit. In the expected output, the single-digit numbers (`0`, `2`, and `5`) are ordered before the two-digit number starting with `2` (`25`), which implies that single-digit numbers need to be interpreted as `0x` where `x` is the number itself for the sorting comparison.

The sorting criteria should be as follows:
1. Compare by the tens digit, with single-digit numbers assuming a tens digit of `0`.
2. If the tens digits are equal, or if the numbers are both single-digit, then compare by the units digit, which is the entire number for single-digit numbers.

After considering the above criteria, let's rewrite the comparison function and the solution properly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    
    int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();
    
    std::vector<int> elements;
    std::unordered_set<int> seen;
    
    // Calculate a_1
    int a = ((k * k) % 1000) / 10;
    
    // Generate the sequence
    while (seen.find(a) == seen.end()) {
        seen.insert(a);
        elements.push_back(a);
        a = ((a * a) % 1000) / 10;
    }
    
    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";
    
    // Sort the sequence by the first digit and then by the second if necessary
    std::sort(elements.begin(), elements.end(), [](int left, int right) {
        int left_tens = left / 10;
        int right_tens = right / 10;
        if (left_tens != right_tens) {
            return left_tens < right_tens;
        }
        return left % 10 < right % 10;
    });
    
    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution now provides a sorting function that adheres to the specified criteria, treating single-digit numbers as if they have a leading zero for the tens digit, and ensures that if two numbers have the same tens digit, they are compared by their units digit. The output should now match the expected result.

The compilation error indicates that `std::sort` was not recognized. This usually happens because the `<algorithm>` header, which defines `std::sort`, was not included. To fix this, we must include the `<algorithm>` header at the beginning of the program.

Here is the entire source code with the necessary fix applied:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm> // Include algorithm for std::sort

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    
    int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();
    
    std::vector<int> elements;
    std::unordered_set<int> seen;
    
    // Calculate a_1
    int a = ((k * k) % 1000) / 10;
    
    // Generate the sequence
    while (seen.find(a) == seen.end()) {
        seen.insert(a);
        elements.push_back(a);
        a = ((a * a) % 1000) / 10;
    }
    
    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";
    
    // Sort the sequence by the first digit and then by the second if necessary
    std::sort(elements.begin(), elements.end(), [](int left, int right) {
        int left_tens = left / 10;
        int right_tens = right / 10;
        if (left_tens != right_tens) {
            return left_tens < right_tens;
        }
        return left < right;
    });
    
    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

Now the program includes the `<algorithm>` header, which should allow the program to compile successfully and include the `std::sort` function for sorting the sequence according to the problem's requirements.

The difference between the expected and the found results lies in the sorting algorithm's handling of numbers with the same first digit. The lambda function provided for `std::sort` is comparing by the full value of the elements when their first digit (tens place) is the same, which does not match the expected output where the order should only consider the first digit and maintain the original order for elements with the same first digit. This is particularly relevant for elements `2` and `25` in the output, which should remain in the same order as they were generated since their first digit is the same.

To fix this, I will rewrite the lambda function to only sort by the first digit (tens digit) and maintain the elements' original order when the first digits are equal. To achieve this, we can use `std::stable_sort` instead of `std::sort`. `std::stable_sort` maintains the relative order of elements that are equivalent based on the comparison criteria.

Here's the rewritten solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm> // To use std::stable_sort

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("sir.in");
    std::ofstream out("sir.out");
    
    int k;
    in >> k;
    in.close();
    
    std::vector<int> elements;
    std::unordered_set<int> seen;
    
    // Calculate a_1
    int a = ((k * k) % 1000) / 10;
    
    // Generate the sequence
    while (seen.find(a) == seen.end()) {
        seen.insert(a);
        elements.push_back(a);
        a = ((a * a) % 1000) / 10;
    }
    
    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";
    
    // Sort the sequence by the first digit using stable_sort
    std::stable_sort(elements.begin(), elements.end(), [](int left, int right) {
        return (left / 10) < (right / 10);
    });
    
    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (int num : elements) {
        out << num << " ";
    }
    out.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly sort the elements by their first digits while maintaining the original order of elements with the same first digit, producing the expected output.
