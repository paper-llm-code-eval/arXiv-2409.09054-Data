Gigel este un pasionat al triunghiurilor. El colectează beţişoare de diferite lungimi şi le asamblează în diferite triunghiuri. Ieri, el avea $6$ beţişoare de lungimi $5$, $2$, $7$, $3$, $12$ şi $3$. Din aceste bețișoare, Gigel a construit un triunghi de laturi $3$, $3$ şi $5$, iar beţişoarele de lungimi $2$, $7$, $12$ au rămas nefolosite pentru că aceste lungimi nu pot forma laturile unui triunghi.

~[0.png]

Din acest motiv, Gigel s-a hotărât să facă o colecţie de beţişoare, dintre care oricum ar alege $3$ elemente, acestea să nu poată forma laturile unui triunghi, proprietate pe care o vom numi în continuare proprietate anti-triunghi. Gigel, pornind de la setul iniţial de lungimi $2, 7, 12$, s-a gândit la două metode de realizare a unei colecţii de $5$ beţişoare cu proprietatea anti-triunghi, şi anume:

1. Păstrează cel mai scurt beţişor, cel de lungime $2$, şi creează un set nou adăugând alte beţişoare de lungime mai mare sau egală cu cel iniţial. De exemplu, următoarele $5$ lungimi sunt corecte: $2, 2, 12, 50, 30$.
2. Păstreză toate beţişoarele, şi anume $2, 7, 12$, pe care le va completa cu alte beţişoare de diferite lungimi (mai scurte sau mai lungi), astfel ca proprietatea anti-triunghi să se păstreze. Următoarele $5$ lungimi respectă proprietatea anti-triunghi: $2, 7, 12, 4, 1$.

# Cerinţă

Cunoscând un şir de $n$ numere naturale nenule $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ având proprietatea anti-triunghi, şi un număr $k$ ($k>n$), se cere să construiţi un şir de $k$ numere naturale având proprietatea anti-triunghi, în conformitate cu una dintre următoarele două restricţii

1. **Varianta 1**: Cel mai mic element este identic cu cel mai mic element din şirul iniţial.
2. **Varianta 2**: Printre cele $k$ elemente ale şirului construit se regăsesc toate elementele şirului iniţial.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `triunghi.in` conţine pe prima linie valorile numerelor $v, n$ şi $k$, separate prin spaţiu. Linia următoare conţine $n$ numere naturale separate prin spaţiu, ce formează un şir cu propietatea anti-triunghi.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `triunghi.out` va conţine $k$ numere pe o singură linie. 

Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $1$, atunci fişierul va conţine $k$ numere naturale cu proprietatea anti-triunghi, separate prin spaţiu, în care cel mai mic element este identic cu minimul şirului dat în fişierul de intrare. 

Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $2$, atunci fişierul va conţine $k$ numere naturale cu proprietatea anti-triunghi, separate prin spaţiu, printre care se regăsesc toate elementele şirului iniţial. 


# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq n < k \leq 46$
* $1 \leq$ lungimea unui beţişor $\leq 2 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerinţe se acordă $30$ de puncte, iar pentru cerinţa a doua se acordă $70$ de puncte.

This solution uses file I/O, vector for storing stick lengths, and std::sort for sorting. The solution generates a sequence of stick lengths that satisfy the anti-triangle property for both possible variants described in the challenge.

Apologies for the confusion. I misunderstood the problem. The anti-triangle property means no three sticks can form a triangle, which implies that for any three sticks, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must not be greater than the length of the third stick. I incorrectly thought that all sticks must be of the same length in variant 1, and did not properly handle the output for variant 2.

Here is the corrected solution for "triunghi.in" and "triunghi.out":

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int v, n, k;
    fin >> v >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> sticks(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sticks[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    // Variant 1: keep the minimum stick and add larger sticks.
    if (v == 1) {
        int min_stick = *std::min_element(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        fout << min_stick << " ";

        // Calculate the maximum possible stick value based on the input constraints.
        long long int max_value = 2000000000;

        // The second stick must be the same as the minimum to maintain the anti-triangle property.
        fout << min_stick << " ";

        // Generate the rest of the sticks with increasingly larger values while maintaining the anti-triangle property.
        for (int i = 2; i < k; ++i) {
            max_value -= min_stick;
            fout << max_value << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
        }
    }
    // Variant 2: keep all initial sticks and add more while keeping the anti-triangle property.
    else {
        std::sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            fout << sticks[i] << " ";
        }

        // Generate the rest of the sticks with increasingly larger values while maintaining the anti-triangle property.
        long long diff = sticks[1] - sticks[0];
        for (int i = n; i < k; ++i) {
            sticks.push_back(sticks.back() + diff);
            fout << sticks.back() << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
        }
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution ensures that for variant 1, the minimum stick length is kept, and the rest of the sticks are chosen such that they maintain the anti-triangle property. For variant 2, all initial sticks are kept, and additional sticks are added such that the sum of any two sticks is still not greater than the length of the third stick, maintaining the anti-triangle property.

From the expected output, it seems we need to adjust the approach for generating additional sticks while maintaining the anti-triangle property. Specifically, the additional sticks need to be large enough so that any three sticks cannot form a triangle, but not necessarily as large as possible within the range up to 2,000,000,000.

Let's reevaluate the rules to generate the additional sticks correctly:
1. For Variant 1 (v=1), the minimum stick length from the initial set is kept, and additional sticks must be larger than the sum of all previously chosen sticks to maintain the anti-triangle property.
2. For Variant 2 (v=2), all initial sticks are kept, and additional sticks must be larger than the sum of the two largest sticks from all previously chosen sticks to maintain the anti-triangle property.

Given these rules, we can generate additional sticks in a controlled manner, ensuring that they are greater than the necessary sum to prevent the formation of triangles.

Here's the revised solution with the corrected logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int v, n, k;
    fin >> v >> n >> k;

    std::vector<long long> sticks(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sticks[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    if (v == 1) {
        // Variant 1: use the minimum stick and add larger sticks.
        long long min_stick = *std::min_element(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        long long next_stick = min_stick;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            fout << next_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            next_stick += min_stick; // Making sure the next stick is larger than the sum of any two so far.
        }
    } else {
        // Variant 2: use all initial sticks and add more.
        std::sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        long long last_sum = sticks[n-2] + sticks[n-1]; // Sum of the two largest sticks.
        long long next_stick = last_sum + 1; // Next stick should be larger than the last sum.
        
        // Output the initial sticks.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            fout << sticks[i] << " ";
        }

        // Add additional sticks maintaining the anti-triangle property.
        for (int i = n; i < k; ++i) {
            fout << next_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            // Update last_sum and next_stick for the next iteration.
            last_sum = sticks[n-1] + next_stick;
            next_stick = last_sum + 1;
        }
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution ensures that the anti-triangle property is maintained. For Variant 1, the minimum stick is used as a basis for generation. For Variant 2, the sequence is continued with sticks larger than the sum of the two largest sticks from the previously chosen sticks.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to a mistake in the algorithm for generating additional stick lengths for variant 1. The correct approach should ensure that:

1. For variant 1, the additional sticks must be larger than the sum of the smallest stick and the last stick chosen to maintain the anti-triangle property.
2. The output should consist of `k` stick lengths, including the initial `n` stick lengths and `k-n` additional sticks.

Let's correct the algorithm for variant 1:

- Start by outputting the minimum stick two times.
- Then, add sticks whose length is greater than the sum of the smallest stick and the last added stick.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int v, n, k;
    fin >> v >> n >> k;
    std::vector<long long> sticks(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sticks[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    // For Variant 1, the minimum stick is used as a basis for generation.
    if (v == 1) {
        std::sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        long long min_stick = sticks[0];

        // Output the minimum stick twice to ensure the anti-triangle property.
        fout << min_stick << " " << min_stick << " ";

        // Generate and output additional sticks ensuring the anti-triangle property.
        long long last_max = min_stick;
        for (int i = 2; i < k; ++i) {
            // Each new stick must be larger than the sum of the smallest and the last largest stick.
            long long new_stick = min_stick + last_max + 1;
            fout << new_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            last_max = new_stick;
        }
    }
    // For Variant 2, all initial sticks are kept and additional sticks are added.
    else {
        std::sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());

        // Output all initial sticks.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            fout << sticks[i] << " ";
        }

        // The next stick must be larger than the sum of the two largest sticks so far.
        long long new_stick = sticks[n - 2] + sticks[n - 1] + 1;

        // Generate and output additional sticks ensuring the anti-triangle property.
        for (int i = n; i < k; ++i) {
            fout << new_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            new_stick += sticks[n - 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, the sticks are sorted initially to find the minimum stick easily. For variant 1, we ensure that each new stick's length is greater than the sum of the smallest stick and the last largest stick. For variant 2, we continue with stick lengths that are greater than the sum of the two largest sticks from the previously chosen sticks, thus maintaining the anti-triangle property.

Upon re-evaluation of the problem, I realize the output is incorrect because the algorithm is not following the rules precisely. Specifically, the additional sticks must also adhere to the anti-triangle property with each other, meaning that the length of each new stick should be greater than the sum of all previously added sticks (not just greater than the last added stick).

To correct the algorithm for variant 1, we can ensure the new stick length is greater than the sum of the smallest stick and twice the last added stick. This guarantees the anti-triangle property is maintained.

Here is the corrected and revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int v, n, k;
    fin >> v >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> sticks(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sticks[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    std::sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());

    if (v == 1) {
        int min_stick = sticks[0];
        // Write twice the minimum stick as stated in the problem
        fout << min_stick << " " << min_stick << " ";
        // Start generating new sticks larger than the sum of the previous two.
        int last1 = min_stick, last2 = min_stick;
        for (int i = 2; i < k; ++i) {
            int new_stick = last1 + last2 + 1;
            fout << new_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            last1 = last2;
            last2 = new_stick;
        }
    } else {
        // Variant 2: keep all initial sticks and add more.
        for (int stick : sticks) {
            fout << stick << " ";
        }

        // The sum of all previously chosen sticks determines the next stick to maintain the anti-triangle property.
        int sum = sticks[n - 1]; // Initialize sum with the largest initial stick.
        for (int i = n; i < k; ++i) {
            int new_stick = sum + 1; // The new stick must be larger than the sum.
            fout << new_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            sum += new_stick; // Update the sum with the new stick.
        }
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution:
- For variant 1, we start by writing twice the minimum stick as per the problem statement, and then we add new sticks that are always larger than the sum of the last two added sticks.
- For variant 2, we write all initial sticks and then add new sticks ensuring the anti-triangle property by making sure each new stick is larger than the sum of all previously added sticks.

The expected output shows that the anti-triangle property must be maintained such that for any three sticks selected from the collection, it is not possible to form a valid triangle. This means that for any three sticks a, b, and c (where a ≤ b ≤ c), it must be true that a + b ≤ c.

The previous solution did not correctly implement this rule for variant 1 when generating new sticks. It attempted to add new sticks larger than the sum of the previous two, but it did not account for the original set of sticks in the proper way, which led to incorrect output. 

Let's correct the solution for variant 1 to ensure that any set of three sticks, including the new ones, cannot form a triangle. This can be done by ensuring that each new stick is greater than the sum of all previously selected sticks.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int v, n, k;
    fin >> v >> n >> k;

    std::vector<long long> sticks(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sticks[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    // Sort the sticks to easily get the smallest and largest ones later.
    std::sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());

    if (v == 1) {
        // For variant 1, we use the same strategy and ensure that each new stick is
        // greater than the sum of all previously selected sticks.
        long long min_stick = sticks[0];
        fout << min_stick << " " << min_stick << " "; // Write the minimum stick twice.

        // The next stick's size should be greater than double the last stick to maintain anti-triangle.
        long long last_stick = min_stick;
        long long total = 2 * min_stick; // Total length of all sticks so far.
        for (int i = 2; i < k; ++i) {
            // Make the next stick larger than the sum of all previous sticks.
            long long next_stick = total + 1;
            fout << next_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            total += next_stick; // Update the total stick length.
            last_stick = next_stick; // Update the last stick to the newest stick.
        }
    } else {
        // Variant 2: Output the initial sticks, which we already know form an anti-triangle set.
        for (long long stick : sticks) {
            fout << stick << " ";
        }
        // Now add extra sticks larger than the sum of two largest sticks so far,
        // so the anti-triangle property is maintained.
        long long sum_of_two_largest = sticks[n - 1] + sticks[n - 2];
        for (int i = n; i < k; ++i) {
            // Append a stick larger than the sum of two largest sticks so far.
            long long next_stick = sum_of_two_largest + 1;
            fout << next_stick << (i < k - 1 ? " " : "");
            // Update the sum of two largest sticks to include the new stick.
            sum_of_two_largest += next_stick;
        }
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution ensures that for variant 1, each new stick's length is greater than the sum of all previously selected sticks, which guarantees that any three sticks picked cannot form a valid triangle. For variant 2, we simply add new sticks that are larger than the sum of the two largest sticks so far, maintaining the anti-triangle property.

The results differ because the algorithm I provided for Variant 1 did not correctly generate the additional sticks. The anti-triangle property must be satisfied, which requires that for any three sticks a, b, and c (where a ≤ b ≤ c), a + b ≤ c. This means the sum of any two sticks should not be greater than the length of the largest stick.

Based on the expected output, we can see that after using the smallest stick twice (which satisfies the anti-triangle property trivially as 2 + 2 ≤ 12), the next sticks are not simply consecutive sums. Instead, they are picked in such a way that they are larger than the sum of the two smallest sticks thus far. It appears that these sticks can be chosen in a pattern that reflects this rule.

Let's correct the algorithm for Variant 1 to follow this pattern. Since we are not given specific instructions on how to generate these numbers and multiple solutions are possible, we will choose a simple strategy to ensure anti-triangle property is satisfied:

1. Start with the two smallest sticks from the initial set.
2. Double the last stick added and check if it is larger than the sum of the two smallest sticks.
3. If it is, add it to the sequence; otherwise, add one more to the smallest stick and try again.

Here is the fully corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int v, n, k;
    fin >> v >> n >> k;

    std::vector<long long> sticks(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sticks[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    std::sort(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());

    if (v == 1) {
        // Variant 1: Start with the smallest stick and maintain the anti-triangle property.
        long long smallest = sticks[0];
        // Add the smallest stick twice, as it satisfies the anti-triangle property.
        fout << smallest << " " << smallest << " ";
        
        long long last_added = smallest;
        for (int i = 2; i < k; ++i) {
            // To ensure the anti-triangle property, each new stick should be larger than
            // the sum of the two smallest sticks in the sequence thus far. Since the sequence
            // is sorted, we can just add the last two sticks to find our minimum next stick.
            long long next_stick = last_added * 2 + 1; 

            // Check if the next stick satisfies the property with the smallest stick.
            if (next_stick > last_added + smallest) {
                fout << next_stick << " ";
            } else {
                // If it does not satisfy the property, increment it until it does.
                next_stick = last_added + smallest + 1;
                fout << next_stick << " ";
            }
            last_added = next_stick;
        }
        fout << "\n";
    } else {
        // Variant 2: All initial elements are kept and new elements are added.
        fout << sticks[0] << " " << sticks[1] << " " << sticks[2] << " ";
        
        // Keep adding new sticks larger than the sum of the two largest sticks so far.
        for (int i = 3; i < k; ++i) {
            // Since the problem guarantees a solution exists and does not specify how to choose the sticks,
            // we can choose them arbitrarily large to satisfy the anti-triangle property.
            // We will simply add the last two sticks and increment by one to ensure this.
            long long next_stick = sticks[i - 1] + sticks[i - 2] + 1; 
            fout << next_stick << " ";
            sticks.push_back(next_stick); // Add the new stick to the sequence.
        }
        fout << "\n";
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly generate a series of sticks with the anti-triangle property for both variants. It maintains the original set of sticks for variant 2 and ensures that each new stick is larger than the sum of the two largest sticks so far. For variant 1, it starts with the smallest stick, doubles the last stick added, and adjusts if necessary to maintain the anti-triangle property.
