Copa ajunse în Orintia unde există un templu cu mai multe nivele, baza fiind un pătrat de lungime $L$. Primul nivel are înălţimea egală cu $N$, iar celelalte nivele au înălţimea mai mare cu o unitate faţă de cel anterior. Spre exemplu pentru $L = 5$ şi $N = 3$ din stâncă răsări templul (imagine din avion şi de la sol): Copa deschise un document vechi şi citi: „Ca să afli cât aur este în templu, trebuie să însumezi numărul de metri de pe fiecare orizontală…”. Şi Copa socoti: $3+3+3+3+3=15$; $3+4+4+4+3=18$; $3+4+5+4+3=19$; celelalte $18$ şi $15$. „Apoi, trebuie să afli suma numerelor obţinute…”. Iar Copa îşi notă numărul $85$. „Toate numerele obţinute se lipesc pentru a forma cel mai mic număr posibil…”. Şi Copa obţinu numărul: $151518181985$. „Din numărul acesta se caută cel mai mare număr de două cifre alăturate. Aceasta este cantitatea de aur din templu.”. Şi Copa ţipă de bucurie: $98$!.

The issue with the original code is that it calculates the sum of each horizontal line incorrectly. The sum for each level should be calculated as if it were a cross-section through the temple, which means the inner squares increase in height as we move inward. Also, the concatenation of sums into the result string is incorrect, as it does not replicate the logic described in the problem statement which should lead to a string like "151518181985". Similarly, the calculation of the maximum adjacent pair is incorrect, as it only checks pairs within the same level sum, not across the concatenated result.

Let's fix the code by correctly calculating the sum at each level, forming the correct concatenated string, and then finding the largest pair of adjacent digits within that string.

Here is the correct code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("templu.in");
    std::ofstream fout("templu.out");
    
    int N, L;
    fin >> N >> L;
    fin.close();

    std::string result;
    // Calculate and append the sums to the result string
    for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < L; ++j) {
            // In the first and last row/column, the height is N
            // Otherwise, it is N plus the minimum distance to any edge (i or j)
            sum += N + std::min({i, j, L - 1 - i, L - 1 - j});
        }
        result += std::to_string(sum);
    }

    // Find the maximum adjacent pair in the result string
    int max_pair = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < result.length() - 1; ++i) {
        int pair = (result[i] - '0') * 10 + (result[i + 1] - '0');
        max_pair = std::max(max_pair, pair);
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fout << max_pair << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

With this code, the correct sum for each level is calculated, and the concatenation of sums is performed correctly. It also correctly identifies the largest adjacent pair of numbers in the entire concatenated result string.

The result differs from the expected output because the sums of each horizontal line are still not being calculated correctly. According to the description, the height at each point within a level increases by 1 as you move inwards from the edge, up to the center. The correction needs to handle the situation where the temple has an odd length side since the center line or column will have the same height across its entire length. Also, the given problem requires us to calculate the sums for the temple viewed from the side, not the top, this makes the problem a bit more intuitive since we need to add the height of each level from bottom to top.

The second line of the output is the maximum two-digit number found within the concatenated string, which is created by placing the sums horizontally next to each other, not vertically.

Let's fix the logic for summing each horizontal line and finding the largest two-digit number correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("templu.in");
    std::ofstream fout("templu.out");
    
    int N, L;
    fin >> N >> L;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<int> sums;
    for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) {
        // Calculate the height of the outermost layer of the current level.
        int height = N + i;
        // For each level, the sum is initially the height of the corners (height) times four.
        // Then, we subtract the four corners (4 * (height - 1)), as they are counted twice.
        // Lastly, we add the inner sections, which have a sum of (L - 2) * (height - 1) * 2,
        // as they are one less in height and there are two lines of them.
        int sum = 4 * height - 4 * (height - 1) + (L - 2) * (height - 1) * 2;
        sums.push_back(sum);
    }

    // Concatenate sums into a single string.
    std::string result;
    for (int sum : sums) {
        result += std::to_string(sum);
    }

    // Find the maximum two-digit number within the concatenated string.
    int max_two_digit_number = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < result.size() - 1; ++i) {
        int two_digit_number = (result[i] - '0') * 10 + (result[i + 1] - '0');
        max_two_digit_number = std::max(max_two_digit_number, two_digit_number);
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fout << max_two_digit_number << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The code above calculates the sum of the heights of each level correctly, concatenates them into a string, and then finds the largest two-digit number within the string. This should now provide the correct output for the given input.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's re-evaluate the logic based on the problem statement.

The expected output indicates that the sum of each "horizontal" line at each level should be calculated based on the pattern observed from the example provided. For each level of the temple, we start at the "outermost" horizontal line, which will have a sum of L * the current height, and as we move inwards, the length of each horizontal line decreases, but the height increases.

Let's correct the algorithm by calculating the sum for each level:

1. Create a 2D structure that represents the temple levels and calculate the sum for each horizontal level.
2. Concatenate these sums to form the required output number.
3. Find the greatest two adjacent digits in this concatenated number.

Here is the re-implemented solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("templu.in");
    std::ofstream fout("templu.out");

    int N, L;
    fin >> N >> L;
    fin.close();

    // Calculate the sum for each horizontal line
    std::string result;
    for (int level = N; level < N + L; ++level) { // iterate through levels
        int sum = 0;
        for (int line = 0; line < L; ++line) { // iterate through lines
            if (line == 0 || line == L - 1) {
                sum += level; // the top and bottom lines are full
            } else {
                sum += level - 1; // the middle lines have reduced height on the borders
            }
        }
        result += std::to_string(sum);
    }

    // Find the largest two-digit number from the concatenated string
    int max_pair = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < result.size() - 1; ++i) {
        int pair = (result[i] - '0') * 10 + (result[i + 1] - '0');
        max_pair = std::max(max_pair, pair);
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fout << max_pair << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code will generate a `result` string that concatenates the sums of the horizontal lines starting from the base level to the top. It will also find the largest two-digit number (the gold quantity) by examining each pair of adjacent numbers in the `result` string. This should provide the correct output as expected.

Upon re-evaluation, it's clear that my previous solutions misunderstood the problem statement regarding how the sums of each horizontal line are calculated. The correct approach should model the temple's horizontal lines as they increase in height from the outermost to the innermost parts. 

Let's rectify the logic to accurately calculate these sums and implement the solution:

1. For each level from the base to the top, calculate the sum of the horizontal line by adding the height of each position. The outer positions have a height of `N`, and for each inward position, the height increases by 1 until it potentially decreases again symmetrically.
2. Concatenate these sums to form the required string.
3. Find the two greatest adjacent digits in this string.

Here is the corrected and rewritten solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("templu.in");
    std::ofstream fout("templu.out");

    int N, L;
    fin >> N >> L;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<int> sums;
    // Calculate the sums for each horizontal line from the outermost to the innermost.
    for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < L; ++j) {
            // Calculate height at the current position.
            int height = N + std::min(std::min(i, j), std::min(L - i - 1, L - j - 1));
            sum += height;
        }
        sums.push_back(sum);
    }

    // Concatenate sums to form the required string.
    std::string result;
    for (int sum : sums) {
        result += std::to_string(sum);
    }

    // Find the greatest two adjacent digits in the string.
    int max_pair = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < result.size() - 1; ++i) {
        int pair = (result[i] - '0') * 10 + (result[i + 1] - '0');
        max_pair = std::max(max_pair, pair);
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fout << max_pair << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This algorithm first calculates the sums for each horizontal line by taking into account the changing height as we move towards the center of the temple's base. It then finds the maximum pair of adjacent digits, which represents the quantity of gold. This solution should now correctly produce the expected output.

Let's revise the approach to ensure it matches the expected output:

1. The temple base is a square of size L x L with an initial height of N.
2. The height increases by 1 for each level above the base.
3. The sum for each level consists of the heights of each "horizontal" line which are visible from the side view.
4. We need to calculate the sum for each horizontal line and concatenate them to form a long number.
5. From this long number, we must find the largest two adjacent digits.

We must correctly calculate the sum for each level. We can observe that horizontally, from the side view, the middle section has a constant height, and only the two ends decrease as we go up each level. Therefore, for each level, the sum consists of:

- 2 corners, each contributing a height of N.
- (L - 2) middle sections, each contributing a height of N + current level.

Given this understanding, let's implement the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("templu.in");
    std::ofstream fout("templu.out");

    int N, L;
    fin >> N >> L;
    fin.close();

    std::string result;
    int sum, corner_height, middle_height;
    for (int level = 0; level < L; ++level) {
        // Calculate the sum for each level from the bottom to the top
        corner_height = N + level;
        middle_height = corner_height + (level < L / 2 ? level : L - level - 1);
        sum = corner_height * 2 + (L - 2) * middle_height;
        result += std::to_string(sum);
    }

    // Find the greatest two adjacent digits in the concatenated string
    int max_pair = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < result.size() - 1; ++i) {
        int pair = (result[i] - '0') * 10 + (result[i + 1] - '0');
        max_pair = std::max(max_pair, pair);
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fout << max_pair << '\n';
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

With this implementation, we calculate the sum for each level correctly and then concatenate these sums to form the required string. Finally, we search through the string for the largest two adjacent digits, which represent the quantity of gold according to the problem statement. This solution should now match the expected output for the given input.

The previous solution still did not correctly calculate the horizontal line sums according to the description provided. To match the expected output, we need to adjust our approach:

1. The base level has a uniform height of N across all L units of length.
2. For each level above the base, the height from the outer edge to the inner part increases by 1 until it reaches the mid-point (center line or column), then it decreases by 1 towards the other edge.
3. For each level, the sum of the horizontal line is calculated by summing the heights of each section considering the increasing and decreasing pattern.
4. Concatenate the sums to form a large number.
5. Find the largest two adjacent digits in this number.

Given the correct pattern for the increment of height and the correct way to calculate the sums, let's implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("templu.in");
    std::ofstream fout("templu.out");

    int N, L;
    fin >> N >> L;
    fin.close();

    // Sum of each horizontal section
    std::vector<int> horizontal_sums(L, 0);

    // Calculate the height for each section and the sum for the horizontal line
    for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) { // For each level
        for (int j = 0; j < L; ++j) { // For each section within the level
            // The height of the current section
            int height = N + std::min(j, L - 1 - j) + std::min(i, L - 1 - i);
            horizontal_sums[i] += height;
        }
    }

    // Concatenate all horizontal sums to form the large number
    std::string large_number;
    for (int sum : horizontal_sums) {
        large_number += std::to_string(sum);
    }

    // Find the largest two adjacent digits in the large number
    int max_adjacent_pair = 0;
    for (size_t i = 1; i < large_number.size(); ++i) {
        int adjacent_pair = (large_number[i - 1] - '0') * 10 + (large_number[i] - '0');
        max_adjacent_pair = std::max(max_adjacent_pair, adjacent_pair);
    }

    // Write the results to the output file
    fout << large_number << '\n';
    fout << max_adjacent_pair << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly calculate the sum for each horizontal line by summing the heights of the temple sections at each level, concatenate these sums as specified, and finally identify the largest two-digit number as required. This should match the expected output for the input provided.
