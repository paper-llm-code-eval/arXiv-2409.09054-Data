Ca în mai toate poveștile, Făt-Frumos a căutat o Cosânzeană și a găsit-o, dar tatăl ei i-a cerut să-i paveze drumul de lungime $N$ care leagă castelele sale. Dalele cu care va pava drumul au aceeași lățime (egală cu lățimea drumului) și lungimi numere naturale. Fiind un împărat cam sâcâit, acesta dorește ca pavarea să se facă folosind un număr minim de dale, diferența de lungime între două dale vecine să nu fie mai mare ca $1$, iar prima și ultima dală să fie de lungime $1$. Împăratul nu se mulțumește să primească de la Făt-Frumos doar un număr (numărul minim de dale necesare): el vrea și posibilitatea de pavare cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Compararea lexicografică a două șiruri de numere este o extensie la numere a comparării alfabetice a două cuvinte. Astfel, fiind date două șiruri numerice de aceeași lungime, $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m$ și $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m$, acestea sunt egale dacă și numai dacă $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $m$. Șirul $A$ este mai mic lexicografic decât șirul $B$ dacă există o valoare $k$ astfel încât $A_k < B_k$ și $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $k - 1$. De exemplu, șirul $3, 5, 4, 1$ este mai mare lexicografic decât șirul $3, 5, 2, 9$ pentru că prima poziție pe care valorile diferă este poziția $3$ ($4 > 2$), fără a mai conta valorile aflate după aceasta.

# Cerință

Cunoscând lungimea drumului, determinați numărul minim de dale necesare pavării și posibilitatea de pavare cu număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Date de intrare

Prima linie a fișierului `pavare.in` conține un număr natural $V$. Linia a doua conține un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă lungimea drumului.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $1$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, doar numărul minim de dale necesare pavării.

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $2$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, un șir de numere separate prin câte un spațiu, ce reprezintă soluția de pavare a drumului, folosind un număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Restricții și precizări

* $V \in \{1,2\}$
* $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$;
* Pentru $30$% din punctaj $V = 1$.

}
```
This solution calculates the number of tiles using a mathematical formula derived from the fact that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k*(k+1)/2`, then it builds the lexicographically smallest tiling array by decrementing the middle tiles symmetrically if the sum exceeds `N`. It has been optimized for both speed and correctness and avoids the use of slower I/O functions by using `fstream`.

The provided solution has a logical error in the writeOutput function. If the value of V is 1, it should still write the number of tiles to the output file. Additionally, the solution should consider special cases where it's impossible to satisfy the condition of the first and last tile being 1 if the number of tiles is less than 3 (since we need at least a 1 at the start, some number in the middle that is at least 1, and 1 at the end). We must ensure that the number of tiles is at least 3 when V is 2.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

void writeOutput(int tiles, const std::vector<int>& paving, int V, const char *filename) {
    std::ofstream out(filename);
    if (V == 1) {
        out << tiles << '\n';
    } else {
        for (int tile : paving) {
            out << tile << ' ';
        }
        out << '\n';
    }
    out.close();
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("pavare.in");
    int V, N;
    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    // Calculate the number of tiles required initially assuming a 1-difference between each tile
    int tiles = (int)ceil((-1.0 + sqrt(1.0 + 8.0 * N)) / 2.0);

    // If V is 1, output the number of tiles and return
    if (V == 1) {
        writeOutput(tiles, {}, V, "pavare.out");
        return 0;
    }

    std::vector<int> paving(tiles, 0);
    int sum = tiles * (tiles + 1) / 2;  // sum of arithmetic series 1+2+...+tiles
    int extra = sum - N; // extra length that exceeds N

    // Initialize paving with increasing tile sizes
    for (int i = 0; i < tiles; ++i) {
        paving[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Adjust tiles from the middle to remove excess length while maintaining symmetry
    for (int i = tiles - 2; i >= 1 && extra > 0; --i) {
        if (paving[i] - paving[i - 1] > 1) {
            int dec = std::min(paving[i] - paving[i - 1] - 1, extra);
            paving[i] -= dec;
            extra -= dec;
        }
    }

    // Ensure the first and last tiles are 1
    paving[0] = paving[tiles - 1] = 1;
    
    writeOutput(tiles, paving, V, "pavare.out");
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the number of tiles as before, but now it properly initializes the paving vector with increasing tile sizes starting from 1. When `V` is 2, the algorithm then adjusts the tile sizes from the middle to the beginning to ensure no two adjacent tiles differ by more than 1 in length, while also removing any excess length to match the total length `N`. The condition that the first and last tiles must be 1 is also enforced at the end before writing to the output.

The previous code indeed contains an error in calculating the number of tiles required. The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output is because the formula used does not account for the restriction that the first and last tiles must be of length 1.

To ensure that the first and last tiles are both 1 while minimizing the number of tiles, we should first use two tiles for the ends. Then, we'll build a sequence of tiles such that each subsequent tile is either the same length or 1 unit longer than the previous one until the middle of the sequence is reached. The sequence will then be symmetrically mirrored.

To calculate the minimum number of tiles, we need to find the smallest `k` such that the sum of the sequence `1 + 2 + ... + k` (which is `k*(k+1)/2`) plus the mirror of this sequence minus the middle element is greater than or equal to `N - 2` (since we're using 2 for the first and last tiles). Additionally, we need to ensure the sequence is valid by not decrementing the middle tiles more than they should be.

Here's the corrected C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

void writeOutput(int tiles, const std::vector<int>& paving, int V, const char *filename) {
    std::ofstream out(filename);
    if (V == 1) {
        out << tiles << '\n';
    } else {
        for (int tile : paving) {
            out << tile << ' ';
        }
        out << '\n';
    }
    out.close();
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("pavare.in");
    int V, N;
    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    // Calculate the number of tiles required
    int k = 0;
    while (k * (k + 1) < 2 * (N - 1)) {
        ++k;
    }

    // If V is 1, output the number of tiles and return
    if (V == 1) {
        writeOutput(k, {}, V, "pavare.out");
        return 0;
    }

    // Construct the lexicographically smallest paving
    std::vector<int> paving(k);
    int sum = k * (k + 1) / 2; // sum of 1 to k
    paving[0] = 1;
    paving[k - 1] = 1;
    int remaining = N - 2; // Subtract the 1-length tiles at each end

    // Fill in the sequence from 1 to k - 2
    for (int i = 1; remaining > 0 && i < k - 1; ++i) {
        paving[i] = std::min(i + 1, remaining);
        remaining -= paving[i];
    }

    // Fill in the symmetry
    for (int i = k - 2; i > 0; --i) {
        paving[k - i - 1] = paving[i];
    }

    writeOutput(k, paving, V, "pavare.out");
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should produce the correct answer for both cases where `V` is 1 and where `V` is 2. The `while` loop calculates the minimum `k` such that the sequence of tiles including the mirrored sequence satisfies the length `N` of the pavement. Then, it constructs the paving sequence according to the rules outlined in the problem statement.

The issue with the previous code is that it incorrectly calculates the number of tiles needed when `V` is 1. The while loop in the code is supposed to determine the smallest `k` such that the sum of arithmetic sequence 1, 2, ..., k, (k-1), ..., 2, 1 is greater than or equal to `N`, but the condition used in the loop is incorrect.

To correct this, we need to consider that the sum of the series 1, 2, ..., k, (k - 1), ..., 2, 1 is `k^2` (if `k` is even) or `k^2 -1` (if `k` is odd), because the middle element is counted twice in the formula `k*(k+1)/2`. So we are looking for the smallest `k` such that `k^2 >= N` or `k^2 - 1 >= N` depending on whether `k` is even or odd.

Let's rewrite the solution to address this issue:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("pavare.in");
    int V, N;
    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    // Calculate the number of tiles required
    int k = (int)std::sqrt(N); // Start with the square root of N
    while (k * k < N) { // Adjust k until k*k is not less than N
        ++k;
    }
    if (k % 2 == 0 && k * k - 1 >= N) { // Adjust for even k if k*k is more than needed
        --k;
    }

    // If V is 1, output the number of tiles
    if (V == 1) {
        std::ofstream out("pavare.out");
        out << k << '\n';
        out.close();
        return 0;
    }

    // Construct lexicographically smallest paving
    std::vector<int> paving;
    int remaining = N;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k / 2; ++i) {
        paving.push_back(i);
        remaining -= i;
    }
    if (k % 2 == 1) {
        paving.push_back(k / 2 + 1);
        remaining -= (k / 2 + 1);
    }
    for (int i = k / 2; i >= 1; --i) {
        if (remaining > i) {
            paving.push_back(i);
            remaining -= i;
        } else {
            paving.push_back(remaining);
            break;
        }
    }

    // Write output
    std::ofstream out("pavare.out");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < paving.size(); ++i) {
        out << paving[i];
        if (i + 1 < paving.size()) {
            out << ' ';
        }
    }
    out << '\n';
    out.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the minimum number of tiles required and construct the lexicographically smallest paving when `V` is 2. The output should match the expected result for the given inputs.

Let's correct the logic to calculate the number of tiles needed. The number of tiles is determined by creating the longest sequence of consecutive integers that starts and ends with 1, and where each adjacent pair of numbers differs by at most 1.

We can achieve this by starting with a 1, then incrementing by 1 for each subsequent tile until we reach a peak, and then decrementing by 1 until we reach 1 again. To minimize the number of tiles, we want the peak to be as high as possible without exceeding the length N.

The sum of such a sequence can be thought of as the sum of two arithmetic sequences (1 to the peak) minus the peak (since it's counted twice). We want to find the maximum peak such that this sum is less than or equal to N.

The sum of the arithmetic sequence from 1 to `p` (the peak) is `p*(p+1)/2`. The total sum for our sequence including both ascending and descending parts is `p*(p+1) - p`, which simplifies to `p*p`. We are looking for the maximum `p` such that `p*p` is less than or equal to `N`.

Once we find `p`, the number of tiles is `2*p - 1` since we have `p` tiles in the ascending sequence and `p-1` tiles in the descending sequence.

Let's rewrite the code to apply this correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("pavare.in");
    int V, N;
    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    int peak = std::sqrt(N); // Start from the square root of N as an initial guess for the peak
    while ((long long)(peak) * (peak) > N) { // Decrease the peak until the condition is satisfied
        --peak;
    }

    int tiles = 2 * peak - 1; // Total number of tiles
    if (V == 1) {
        std::ofstream out("pavare.out");
        out << tiles << std::endl;
        out.close();
        return 0;
    }

    // When V is 2, we have to construct the lexicographically smallest sequence
    std::vector<int> paving(tiles);
    int sum = peak * peak; // The sum of the sequence
    for (int i = 0; i < peak; ++i) {
        paving[i] = i + 1;
        paving[tiles - i - 1] = i + 1;
    }

    // If the sum is less than N, we need to adjust the peak tile(s)
    if (sum < N) {
        paving[peak - 1]++; // Increment the peak value
        if (peak * 2 - 1 < tiles) { // If there's a second peak tile, increment it as well
            paving[peak]++;
        }
    }

    std::ofstream out("pavare.out");
    for (int i = 0; i < tiles; ++i) {
        out << paving[i] << (i < tiles - 1 ? " " : "");
    }
    out << std::endl;
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly calculate the minimum number of tiles required and, if V is 2, construct the lexicographically smallest valid sequence. The number of tiles is calculated by first finding the maximum peak that can fit within the length N, and then adjusting the sequence if necessary. The output should match the expected result for the given inputs.

After reviewing the problem again, I realize that the previous solutions did not account for the condition that the difference in length between any two adjacent tiles cannot exceed 1. This means that we can't simply use the maximum peak that fits within the length N as we did before.

The sequence that we need to aim for will be a sequence such as "1, 2, ..., x, x, ..., 2, 1", where x is the highest number in the sequence. The length of the path, N, would be equal to the sum of an arithmetic series up to x minus 1, plus x, plus the sum of the arithmetic series from x decreasing to 2, plus the last 1.

The correct approach is to find x such that the sum of the series is as close as possible to N without exceeding it, and then to determine the total number of tiles needed, which will be 2 * x - 1 if we don't need to repeat the peak number, or 2 * x if we do.

Let's write the correct solution that calculates the number of tiles based on this approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("pavare.in");
    int V, N;
    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    // Finding the peak of the series to minimize the number of tiles used
    int x = 1;
    while ((3 * x * x + 3 * x + 2) <= 2 * N) {
        x++;
    }
    x--;

    int total_length = x * (x + 1);  // Sum of arithmetic series 1 to x
    if (2 * total_length + 1 < N) {  // Check if we can repeat the peak number
        total_length += x + 1;
    } else {
        total_length += x;
    }

    int tiles_needed = (total_length > N) ? 2 * x : 2 * x + 1;

    if (V == 1) {
        std::ofstream out("pavare.out");
        out << tiles_needed << '\n';
        out.close();
    } else {
        // If V is 2, we also need to write the tile lengths to the output
        std::ofstream out("pavare.out");
        for (int i = 1; i <= x; ++i) {
            out << i << " ";
        }
        if (total_length > N) {
            x--;
        }
        for (int i = x; i >= 1; --i) {
            out << i << (i > 1 ? " " : "");
        }
        out << '\n';
        out.close();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the minimum number of tiles required for a given path length N and output the lexicographically smallest tiling sequence when V is 2. The output should finally match the expected result for the given inputs.

It seems that the previous solutions provided incorrect logic for calculating the minimum number of tiles required given the constraints. To solve this problem accurately, we must find the smallest even number `k` for which the inequality `k*(k+2)/4 <= N` holds. This represents the sum of an arithmetic series that peaks at `k/2`. If this inequality does not hold, then we must use an odd number `k`, which means one of the middle tiles will be `k/2 + 1` to satisfy the condition `((k-1)*k/4) + (k/2 + 1) <= N`.

Let's implement the solution with this new approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Function to calculate the tiles needed and fill the paving if V is 2
std::pair<int, std::vector<int>> calculateTilesAndPaving(int N, int V) {
    int k = 2;
    while (k * (k + 2) / 4 < N) {
        k += 2;
    }
    if (k * (k + 2) / 4 != N) { // If N is not the sum of 1 to k/2 twice
        k -= 1; // Use the odd series
    }

    int tiles_needed = k;
    
    std::vector<int> paving;
    if (V == 2) {
        int current = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k / 2; ++i) {
            paving.push_back(current++);
        }
        if (k % 2 == 1) {
            paving.push_back(current); // Middle tile when k is odd
        }
        for (int i = k / 2 - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            paving.push_back(paving[i]);
        }
    }

    return {tiles_needed, paving};
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("pavare.in");
    int V, N;
    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    auto [tiles_needed, paving] = calculateTilesAndPaving(N, V);

    std::ofstream out("pavare.out");
    if (V == 1) {
        out << tiles_needed << '\n';
    } else {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < paving.size(); ++i) {
            out << paving[i] << (i + 1 < paving.size() ? " " : "");
        }
        out << '\n';
    }
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now accurately calculate the number of tiles required by finding the smallest `k` that satisfies the constraints. For `V` equal to 2, it also constructs the lexicographically smallest sequence of tile sizes that can be used to pave the road. The output should match the expected result for the input provided.
