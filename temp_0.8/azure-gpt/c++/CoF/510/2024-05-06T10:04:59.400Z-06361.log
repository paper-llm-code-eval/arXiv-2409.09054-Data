Un joc dispune de $N$ cuburi galbene și $N$ cuburi albastre, de dimensiuni identice; pe fiecare cub galben este scris un număr natural nenul, de cel mult $9$ cifre. Jocul urmărește construirea unui castel alcătuit din mai multe rânduri de cuburi, în care rândul de sus este format dintr-un singur cub, de culoare galbenă, iar fiecare dintre celelalte rânduri încep și se termină cu câte un cub de culoare galbenă. Oricare două cuburi vecine pe același rând au câte o latură comună și fiecare cub, cu excepția celor galbene de pe margine, are o latură comună cu un cub care aparține rândului de deasupra. Oricare două cuburi cu o latură comună au culori diferite. 

Rândurile de cuburi sunt numerotate de jos în sus, începând de la $1$. Pentru construcția castelului se preiau cuburile galbene în ordinea în care acestea sunt date, iar cele albastre într-o ordine oarecare, și sunt plasate pe rânduri, de jos în sus, și pe fiecare rând de la stânga la dreapta, astfel: primul cub se plasează pe rândul de la bază (numerotat cu $1$), apoi fiecare cub (galben sau albastru) se plasează fie în continuare, pe rândul curent la dreapta, fie pe un rând nou, peste un cub al rândului curent. După plasarea cubului din vârful castelului, pe fiecare cub albastru se scrie un număr egal cu suma numerelor scrise pe cei doi vecini galbeni situați pe același rând, în stânga și în dreapta sa. Pentru a câștiga jocul, castelul obținut trebuie să aibă un număr maxim de rânduri, chiar dacă poate nu folosește toate cuburile date.

# Cerințe

Cunoscând numerele scrise pe cele $N$ cuburi galbene, în ordinea dată, scrieți un program care să determine:
1. Numărul cuburilor galbene, dintre cele $N$ date, pe care sunt scrise valori de o singură cifră;
2. Rândul pe care se află cubul din vârful castelului și numărul scris pe acest cub;
3. Numărul cuburilor albastre din care este alcătuit castelul și suma tuturor numerelor de pe acestea.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `castel.in` conţine:
* Pe prima linie două numere naturale $C$ și $N$, în această ordine, despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $C$ reprezintă numărul cerinţei și poate avea valorile $1$, $2$ sau $3$, iar $N$ are semnificația din enunț;
* Pe a doua linie, $N$ numere naturale despărțite prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând numerele scrise pe cuburile galbene, în ordinea în care sunt preluate.

# Date de ieșire
Fişierul `castel.out` conţine pe prima linie:
* Un singur număr natural pentru rezolvarea cerinței $1$, reprezentând valoarea determinată conform acestei cerințe;
* Două numere naturale despărțite printr-un spațiu, în cazul cerințelor $2$ și $3$. Pentru cerința $2$, primul număr reprezintă rândul pe care se află cubul din vârful castelului iar cel de-al doilea număr reprezintă valoarea scrisă pe acest cub. Pentru cerința $3$, prima valoare reprezintă numărul de cuburi albastre care alcătuiesc castelul, iar a doua valoare reprezintă suma tuturor numerelor scrise pe aceste cuburi.


# Restricții și precizări
* $3 \leq N \leq 5 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $C = 1$;

The initial solution was incorrect because it had a fundamental misunderstanding of how to build the castle and calculate the levels correctly. Specifically, it was not properly handling the logic needed to determine when to move to the next level of the castle.

Let's correct the logic of our solution by using a stack to simulate the construction of the castle, where each level is represented by the number of blocks on that level. When the current level is full (the number of blocks on the current level is twice the number of blocks on the previous level minus one), we move to the next level.

Here is the corrected c++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("castel.in");
    std::ofstream fout("castel.out");

    int C, N, single_digit_count = 0;
    fin >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> yellow_blocks(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> yellow_blocks[i];
        if (yellow_blocks[i] < 10) {
            single_digit_count++;
        }
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        fout << single_digit_count << "\n";
    } else {
        std::vector<int> stack;
        int blue_blocks_count = 0;
        long long sum_of_blue = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() == 1) {
                stack.pop_back(); // Reached the end of the current level
            }

            if (stack.empty()) {
                // Start new level
                stack.push_back(1);
            } else {
                // Increase count at current level
                stack.back()++;
                // Count blue blocks and compute their sum
                if (stack.size() > 1) {
                    blue_blocks_count++;
                    sum_of_blue += yellow_blocks[i] + yellow_blocks[i - 1];
                }
            }
        }

        if (C == 2) {
            fout << stack.size() << " " << yellow_blocks[N - 1] << "\n";
        } else if (C == 3) {
            fout << blue_blocks_count << " " << sum_of_blue << "\n";
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Note that the code still avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf` as required by the challenge. It reads from "castel.in" and writes to "castel.out". The stack data structure efficiently keeps track of the levels of the castle and is updated as we read the yellow blocks from the input file. The code increments the count of blue blocks and calculates their sum as it builds the castle for requirement 3. For requirement 2, it outputs the size of the stack (which represents the number of levels) and the value of the last yellow block, which is at the top of the castle.

Upon reevaluating the logic, I can see that my previous solution still did not properly account for the rules of placing the blocks and computing the levels correctly. The expected output indicates that the top block of the castle is on the 4th row and has a value of 5.

To construct the castle according to the rules, we can't use a simple stack. We need to keep track of the levels in more detail. Each level should be able to hold one more block than the level above it.

Here's the corrected algorithm:

1. Iterate through the yellow blocks while simulating the construction of the castle.
2. Start with the first yellow block on the ground level.
3. For each subsequent yellow block, determine whether it should be placed on the current level or start a new level.

The new level is started if the current level has the correct number of blocks, which is one more than the number of blocks in the level above it.

Let's rewrite the C++ solution accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("castel.in");
    std::ofstream fout("castel.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> yellow_blocks(N), level_blocks(N, 0);
    int single_digit_count = 0, blue_blocks_count = 0;
    long long sum_of_blue = 0;
    
    // Read yellow block values and count the single-digit values
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> yellow_blocks[i];
        if (yellow_blocks[i] < 10) {
            single_digit_count++;
        }
    }

    int current_level = 0;
    level_blocks[0] = 1; // First block is on the ground level

    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        if (2 * level_blocks[current_level] - 1 == level_blocks[current_level - 1]) {
            current_level++; // Start a new level
        }
        level_blocks[current_level]++;
        // Add the sum of blue blocks count and their values for all levels except the top
        if (current_level > 0) {
            blue_blocks_count++;
            sum_of_blue += yellow_blocks[i] + yellow_blocks[i - 1];
        }
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        fout << single_digit_count << "\n";
    } else if (C == 2) {
        fout << current_level + 1 << " " << yellow_blocks[N - 1] << "\n";
    } else if (C == 3) {
        fout << blue_blocks_count << " " << sum_of_blue << "\n";
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we use an array `level_blocks` to keep track of how many blocks are on each level. We iterate over the yellow blocks, adding them to the current level if possible or starting a new level when the current level is full. The fullness of a level is determined by whether it has twice as many blocks as the level above it minus one (for the two yellow blocks on the edges). The blue block counts and sums are updated as we go, except for the top level.

I apologize for the oversight. It seems that there was a misunderstanding in the previous implementations regarding the construction of the castle. Given the rules and the expected output, it's clear that each level of the castle, except for the topmost level, has one more cube than the level above it. This is because each level must start and end with a yellow cube and have alternating colors, necessitating an additional blue cube between each pair of adjacent yellow cubes.

To build the castle and produce the expected output, we'll use the following strategy:

1. Start with the first yellow cube on the first level.
2. Continue adding yellow cubes to the current level until we can't add any more without violating the rule for the number of yellow cubes on the previous level.
3. Once the current level has the maximum number of yellow cubes, increment the level and continue adding yellow cubes.
4. For each blue cube on a level (except the topmost level with only one yellow cube), calculate its value as the sum of the yellow cubes on either side.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("castel.in");
    std::ofstream fout("castel.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> yellow_blocks(N);
    int single_digit_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> yellow_blocks[i];
        if (yellow_blocks[i] < 10) {
            single_digit_count++;
        }
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        fout << single_digit_count << "\n";
    } else {
        // Calculate the height of the castle
        int height = (-1 + std::sqrt(1 + 8 * N)) / 2;
        int top_block_index = height * (height - 1) / 2;
        if (C == 2) {
            fout << height << " " << yellow_blocks[top_block_index] << "\n";
        } else if (C == 3) {
            int blue_blocks_count = N - height;
            long long sum_of_blue = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < top_block_index; ++i) {
                // Sum of blue blocks is the sum of adjacent yellow blocks
                sum_of_blue += yellow_blocks[i - 1] + yellow_blocks[i];
            }
            fout << blue_blocks_count << " " << sum_of_blue << "\n";
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code corrects the logic for both the height of the castle (case C == 2) and the count and sum of blue blocks (case C == 3). The height is determined based on the number of yellow blocks that can fit within the given rules, and the top block's index is calculated using that height. The sum of blue blocks is computed by adding the values of the yellow blocks on either side. The updated code should now provide the correct output as per the examples.

Let's re-evaluate the problem with a correct understanding of the rules.

Each level of the castle, except for the very top, must start and end with a yellow block and contain alternating blue and yellow blocks in between. The number of yellow blocks on level `i` is one more than on level `i+1`. This is because each blue block must be placed between two yellow blocks. As such, to maximize the number of levels, we should use the fewest yellow blocks possible per level while adhering to the rules.

To calculate the level and the top block value correctly, we need to determine how many yellow blocks would be on each level. Let's reconsider the number of blocks on each level. The first level will have 1 yellow block, the second level will have 2 yellow blocks, the third will have 3 yellow blocks, and so on. The pattern is that the `i`th level will have `i` yellow blocks.

Let's implement the solution considering this pattern:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("castel.in");
    std::ofstream fout("castel.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;

    int* yellow_blocks = new int[N];
    int single_digit_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> yellow_blocks[i];
        if (yellow_blocks[i] < 10) {
            single_digit_count++;
        }
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        fout << single_digit_count << "\n";
    } else {
        // Start building the castle
        int level = 1;  // The current level
        int blocks_in_level = 1;  // Yellow blocks in the current level
        int yellow_index = 0;  // Index of the current yellow block

        // Use yellow blocks to build the castle
        while (yellow_index + blocks_in_level < N) {
            yellow_index += blocks_in_level;  // Place yellow blocks on the current level
            level++;  // Move up to the next level
            blocks_in_level++;  // Increase the number of yellow blocks for the next level
        }

        // For task 2, output the level number and the last yellow block number
        if (C == 2) {
            fout << level << " " << yellow_blocks[yellow_index] << "\n";
        }
        // For task 3, output the number of blue blocks and their total sum
        else if (C == 3) {
            int blue_blocks_count = N - level;  // Total blue blocks used
            long long sum_of_blue = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < yellow_index; i += 2) {
                sum_of_blue += yellow_blocks[i - 1] + yellow_blocks[i];
            }
            fout << blue_blocks_count << " " << sum_of_blue << "\n";
        }
    }

    delete[] yellow_blocks;
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly address the problem and produce the expected output. It builds the castle according to the rules and calculates the number of levels and the value on the top yellow block for the given input data. The corresponding outputs for tasks 2 and 3 are then written to the "castel.out" file.

It's evident there's been a misunderstanding in determining the level on which the top block is placed and calculating the count and sum of blue blocks. The expected output indicates that the castle with 12 yellow blocks should have 4 levels, and the top yellow block should have the value 5.

The castle construction rules state that each level, except for the top one, starts and ends with a yellow block. The number of blocks on each level from the second one onwards must be one more than on the previous level. 

Given these rules, the number of yellow blocks on each level would be as follows:
- Level 1: 1 yellow block (the top of the castle)
- Level 2: 2 yellow blocks
- Level 3: 3 yellow blocks
- ...
- Level n: n yellow blocks

To maximize the height of the castle, we need to place as few yellow blocks as possible on each level while satisfying the above condition, starting from the top and moving downwards.

Since the last level will have the most yellow blocks, we should start from level 1 and keep adding yellow blocks to each subsequent level until we run out of yellow blocks. Then we count the number of remaining yellow blocks and that will indicate the value of the top block.

Let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("castel.in");
    std::ofstream fout("castel.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;

    int* yellow_blocks = new int[N];
    int single_digit_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> yellow_blocks[i];
        if (yellow_blocks[i] < 10) {
            single_digit_count++;
        }
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        fout << single_digit_count << "\n";
    } else {
        int level = 0;
        int blocks_used = 0;
        int blue_blocks_count = 0;
        long long sum_of_blue = 0;

        // Calculate the height of the castle and the count and sum of blue blocks
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            blocks_used += i; // Add i yellow blocks for the ith level
            if (blocks_used >= N) { // Check if we've used all yellow blocks
                level = i; // The current level will be the highest level of the castle
                blocks_used -= i; // Subtract the last level's yellow blocks to get the number of used blocks

                sum_of_blue += yellow_blocks[j - 1] + yellow_blocks[j];

This solution should now correctly determine the level on which the top block is placed and calculate the corresponding value for task 2. For task 3, it should also correctly count the number of blue blocks and calculate their sum. The solution iteratively computes the height of the castle, respecting the rule that each level—except for the top one—must start and end with a yellow block.

The previous solutions were not correctly implementing the rules of the castle construction given in the problem statement. Let me attempt to fix the solution based on a correct understanding of the rules:

1. Each level of the castle must start and end with a yellow block.
2. The number of blue blocks on a level must be one less than the number of yellow blocks on that level.
3. There should be a maximum number of levels, even if some yellow blocks remain unused.

Given these rules, the strategy for placing blocks should be:
- Place the first yellow block as the top of the castle.
- For subsequent levels, place as many yellow blocks as possible until just enough remain to start the next level with one more yellow block than the current level.

The top yellow block will be the first one that cannot be placed on a level because there are not enough yellow blocks remaining to start the next level.

Here is a corrected implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("castel.in");
    std::ofstream fout("castel.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> yellow_blocks(N);
    int single_digit_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> yellow_blocks[i];
        if (yellow_blocks[i] < 10) {
            single_digit_count++;
        }
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        fout << single_digit_count << "\n";
    } else {
        int current_level = 1; // Start at level 1 (the top of the castle)
        int yellow_blocks_used = 1; // We use one yellow block for the top of the castle

        // We keep track of the last yellow block placed on the previous level
        int last_yellow_on_prev_level = 0;

        // Calculate the maximum number of levels
        while (yellow_blocks_used + current_level + 1 <= N) {
            last_yellow_on_prev_level = yellow_blocks_used;
            yellow_blocks_used += (current_level + 1); // Place one more yellow block on the next level
            current_level++;
        }

        if (C == 2) {
            fout << current_level << " " << yellow_blocks[last_yellow_on_prev_level] << "\n";
        } else if (C == 3) {
            // Calculate the number of blue blocks and their sum
            int blue_blocks_count = yellow_blocks_used - current_level;
            long long sum_of_blue = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < yellow_blocks_used; i += 2) {
                sum_of_blue += yellow_blocks[i] + yellow_blocks[i + 1];
            }
            fout << blue_blocks_count << " " << sum_of_blue << "\n";
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly determine the level on which the top block is placed (C == 2) by incrementing the current level while there are enough yellow blocks to ensure the next level can start. The top yellow block's value is then the last block used in the previous level. For C == 3, it calculates the number of blue blocks and their sum by iterating through the used yellow blocks and summing the values of adjacent pairs.
