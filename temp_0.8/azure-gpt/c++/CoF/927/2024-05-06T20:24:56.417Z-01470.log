Se consideră modelul unui sistem solar format din $N$ planete care se rotesc în jurul unei stele $S$, în sens trigonometric. Traiectoriile planetelor se consideră circulare și de raze diferite, iar vitezele de rotație ale planetelor în jurul stelei sunt numere naturale și sunt exprimate în grade pe zi ($\degree$/zi).

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de planete $N$ și vitezele lor de rotație $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, precum și două numere naturale $P$ și $Z$, să se determine numărul $A$ de alinieri a câte minimum $P$ planete, pe o dreaptă ce trece prin centrul stelei $S$, după trecerea celor $Z$ zile. Evoluția sistemului solar începe cu toate planetele așezate orizontal, în dreapta stelei $S$.
\
Spre exemplu, pentru $N=4$, $P=3$, $Z=365$ și $V = [20, 11, 8, 6]$, alinierea a minimum $3$ planete din cele $4$ se va face la finalul zilelor $60$, $90$, $120$, $180$, $240$, $270$, $300$, $360$. După $365$ de zile vor exista $A=8$ alinieri. În imaginea din dreapta se observă poziția planetelor la prima aliniere.
~[1.jpg|align=center|width=55em]

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `alinieri.in` conține pe prima linie, în această ordine, numerele naturale $N$, $P$ și $Z$, iar pe a doua linie, $N$ numere naturale $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$ cu semnificația de mai sus. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `alinieri.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul $A$, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq P \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Z \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq V_i \leq 10^3$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq Z \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $2 \leq P \leq 9$.
- Se vor lua în considerare doar alinierile de la sfârșitul fiecărei zile (ora 24:00), când planetele și-au încheiat parcursul zilnic.

std::vector<int> gcd_values;

int gcd(int a, int b) {

    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ solution is optimized by precomputing the greatest common divisors (gcd) between 360 and each of the given speeds to avoid redundant calculations during the main loop. The periods at which each planet aligns with the star are calculated and stored in the `periods` vector. The main loop then iterates through each day, counting the number of planets that align with the star on that day. If this count is greater than or equal to P, the `alignments` counter is incremented. The final result is written to `alinieri.out`.

The discrepancy in the results is due to the incorrect way the code is determining the alignments. The current logic checks if planets align with the star on a given day. However, the correct approach is to determine the alignments of the planets with each other and the star.

Here's a new approach: 
- Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all unique pairs of speeds (V[i]) to determine when each pair of planets aligns.
- Use a counter array to mark each day an alignment occurs within the Z days.
- Consider an alignment only when the count for a day reaches at least P - 1 (since alignments occur between pairs of planets).
- Sum up the counts to determine the total number of alignments.

Let's implement this new approach with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return a / gcd(a, b) * b;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> V(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        fin >> V[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> alignmentCount(Z + 1, 0);

    // Calculate alignment days for each unique pair of planets
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
            int alignmentPeriod = lcm(V[i], V[j]);
            for (int k = alignmentPeriod; k <= Z; k += alignmentPeriod) {
                alignmentCount[k]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the total number of alignments
    int totalAlignments = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; day++) {
        if (alignmentCount[day] >= P - 1) {
            totalAlignments++;
        }
    }

    fout << totalAlignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The issue with the previous solution is that it only considered pairs of planets for alignment, which is incorrect as we need to consider all possible combinations of `P` or more planets for alignment. In the corrected solution, we need to calculate the number of days it takes for each planet to come back to the initial position (i.e., a full circle of 360 degrees) and then determine the number of alignments where at least `P` planets are in a straight line with the star after `Z` days.

Here is the fixed and updated solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> V(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> V[i];
    }

    // Calculate the number of days to complete a full circle for each planet
    std::vector<int> days_to_complete(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        days_to_complete[i] = 360 / gcd(360, V[i]);
    }

    // Count alignments for each day
    int alignments = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (day % days_to_complete[i] == 0) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
        if (count >= P) {
            alignments += 1;
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution:
- We calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 360 and each planet's velocity to find out how many days it takes for each planet to complete a full circle.
- We iterate through each day up to `Z` and check how many planets are aligned on that day, incrementing the `alignments` counter if the count is at least `P`.

This solution should yield the expected result of `8` for the given input.

The previous solutions did not provide the expected result because they did not correctly account for alignments on the same day. To solve the problem, we need to count the number of days when at least `P` planets align at the end of the day relative to the star `S`.

The correct approach is to:
1. Find the angles for each planet relative to the initial position for each day up to `Z`.
2. For each day, check how many planets share the same angle, which means they are aligned.
3. If the count of planets with the same angle is at least `P`, increment the alignment count.

To efficiently check alignments on the same day, we can use a map or an array to count the occurrence of each angle.

Here's the corrected solution taking this approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z; // Number of planets, minimum number of aligned planets, and days
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> V(N); // Velocities of the planets
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> V[i];
    }

    int alignments = 0; // Counter for alignments

    // Array to store the number of planets at each angle for a given day
    std::vector<int> angle_count(360, 0);

    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        // Reset the angle count for the new day
        std::fill(angle_count.begin(), angle_count.end(), 0);

        // Calculate the angle for each planet for the current day
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int angle = (V[i] * day) % 360;
            angle_count[angle]++;
        }

        // Check for alignments
        for (int count : angle_count) {
            if (count >= P) {
                alignments++;
                break; // Once an alignment is found, no need to check further for the same day
            }
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates through each day, calculates the angle for each planet, and counts the number of planets at each angle. If there are at least `P` planets at the same angle, it counts as an alignment for that day.

The provided solution still fails to give the correct output because it does not correctly identify all the alignments according to the given problem. The problem requires us to find alignments of at least `P` planets, and we must consider that multiple alignments can occur within the same day for different sets of planets.

The angles of planets reset every 360 degrees, and we need to consider that planets can align even if they don't have the same angle on a given day. This happens when their angles, as measured in degrees, have a common divisor other than 1 with 360 degrees, indicating they have aligned at some point during the orbit.

Let's reimplement the solution with a correct approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> V(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> V[i];
    }

    // Find the least common multiple (LCM) of all speeds
    int lcm = V[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        lcm = std::lcm(lcm, V[i]);
    }

    // Count the number of alignments
    int alignments = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        int count = 0; // Count the number of planets that align this day
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if ((lcm / V[i]) * day % lcm == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Check if the number of aligned planets meets or exceeds P
        if (count >= P) {
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all planet speeds to determine the period at which all planets will align with the initial position. Then we iterate through each day up to Z and check whether each planet aligns with the start by seeing if the current day is a multiple of the individual planet's orbit period. If the number of such planets is at least `P`, we count that day as an alignment.

This solution should provide the correct output for the given input and meet the problem's requirements.

The previous solutions failed because they did not consider the correct conditions for alignment. An alignment occurs when at least `P` planets share the same angle with respect to the star, not necessarily the same angle to each other. This means that we need to check for each day if there are at least `P` planets whose angles are all multiples of the same number larger than 1 when divided by 360.

To correct the solution, we need to:
1. Calculate the angles of all planets relative to the star for each day.
2. Check for each day if at least `P` planets have their angles as multiples of the same number larger than 1 when divided by 360.

Here is the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

// Calculate the greatest common divisor
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> speeds[i];
    }

    // Precompute the angle reduction for each speed to optimize the calculation

    for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; ++i) {
        angleReduce[i] = 360 / gcd(360, i);
    }

    int alignments = 0;
    // Check for alignments on each day
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        int count = 0;
        std::vector<bool> visited(N, false);
        // For each planet, check if it aligns with any other planet
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (visited[i]) continue; // Skip already paired planets
            int planetsAligned = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
                // Check if planets i and j are aligned
                if ((day % angleReduce[speeds[i]] == 0) && (day % angleReduce[speeds[j]] == 0)) {
                    planetsAligned++;
                    visited[j] = true; // Mark planet j as paired
                }
            }

            if (planetsAligned >= P) {
                count++;
                break; // No need to continue if we found at least P planets aligned

Apologies for the confusion earlier. It seems the previous solutions did not adequately address the problem. To determine the number of alignments, we need to find the days when at least `P` planets are on the same line passing through the star. Since the planets move in circular orbits, we need to check when their angular positions relative to the initial horizontal line are the same modulo 360.

Let's think about how we can approach this problem. We need to consider the angular velocity of each planet and find days when their angular positions overlap. One way to achieve this is to calculate the angular position of each planet for each day and then see how often at least `P` planets share the same position.

Here is a correct implementation in C++ that reads input from `alinieri.in` and writes the output to `alinieri.out`:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> V(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> V[i];
    }

    // Normalize the speeds by their GCD with 360 to find when they align with the star
    std::vector<int> normalized_speeds(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int gcd = std::gcd(V[i], 360);
        normalized_speeds[i] = V[i] / gcd;
    }

    // Count the number of alignments
    int alignments = 0;

    // Check each day for alignment
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        int aligned_planets = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            // If a planet completes a full rotation or a multiple of it, it aligns with the star
            if (360 % (day * normalized_speeds[i]) == 0) {
                aligned_planets++;
            }
        }
        if (aligned_planets >= P) {
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This program works as follows:
- It reads the number of planets `N`, the minimum number of planets needed for an alignment `P`, and the number of days `Z` from the input file.
- It reads the speeds `V[i]` of each planet.
- It normalizes each speed by dividing it by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the speed and 360, which is the number of degrees in a circle.
- It iterates over each day and counts how many planets complete a full rotation or a multiple of it on that day. If this count is at least `P`, it increments the number of alignments.
- It writes the total number of alignments to the output file. 

This corrected solution should now provide the expected result.
