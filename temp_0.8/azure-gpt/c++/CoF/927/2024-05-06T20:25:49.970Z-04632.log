Se consideră modelul unui sistem solar format din $N$ planete care se rotesc în jurul unei stele $S$, în sens trigonometric. Traiectoriile planetelor se consideră circulare și de raze diferite, iar vitezele de rotație ale planetelor în jurul stelei sunt numere naturale și sunt exprimate în grade pe zi ($\degree$/zi).

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de planete $N$ și vitezele lor de rotație $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, precum și două numere naturale $P$ și $Z$, să se determine numărul $A$ de alinieri a câte minimum $P$ planete, pe o dreaptă ce trece prin centrul stelei $S$, după trecerea celor $Z$ zile. Evoluția sistemului solar începe cu toate planetele așezate orizontal, în dreapta stelei $S$.
\
Spre exemplu, pentru $N=4$, $P=3$, $Z=365$ și $V = [20, 11, 8, 6]$, alinierea a minimum $3$ planete din cele $4$ se va face la finalul zilelor $60$, $90$, $120$, $180$, $240$, $270$, $300$, $360$. După $365$ de zile vor exista $A=8$ alinieri. În imaginea din dreapta se observă poziția planetelor la prima aliniere.
~[1.jpg|align=center|width=55em]

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `alinieri.in` conține pe prima linie, în această ordine, numerele naturale $N$, $P$ și $Z$, iar pe a doua linie, $N$ numere naturale $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$ cu semnificația de mai sus. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `alinieri.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul $A$, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq P \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Z \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq V_i \leq 10^3$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq Z \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $2 \leq P \leq 9$.
- Se vor lua în considerare doar alinierile de la sfârșitul fiecărei zile (ora 24:00), când planetele și-au încheiat parcursul zilnic.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAXN = 100000;
int freq[360];

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z, V;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> velocities(N);

    // Read velocities and calculate frequencies of angles after Z days
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> V;
        ++freq[(V * Z) % 360];
    }

    // Count how many times we have at least P planets aligned
    int alignments = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 360; ++i) {
        if (freq[i] >= P)
            ++alignments;
    }

    fout << alignments << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```
Explanation of the solution:

1. Open the input file `alinieri.in` and output file `alinieri.out`.
2. Declare variables and read `N`, `P`, and `Z` from the file.
3. Initialize a vector to store the velocities of the planets.
4. Loop through the velocities, read them from the file, and calculate the final angle position after `Z` days modulo 360. We use a frequency array to count how many planets will be at each possible angle.
5. Loop through the frequency array and count how many times we have at least `P` planets at the same angle, indicating an alignment.
6. Write the number of alignments to the output file.
7. Close both the input and output files.

This solution takes advantage of the fact that the positional frequency of planets after `Z` days can only be one of the 360 possible angles (as degrees are modulo 360). Instead of simulating each day's movements, it jumps straight to the final positions and counts alignments directly.

The issue with the previous solution is that it only counts the exact points where planets align after Z days. However, the problem requires us to count the number of alignments at the end of each day up to Z days. We need to account for all the alignments that happen throughout the Z days, not just their final positions after Z days.

To fix this, we must consider the relative movements of the planets. An alignment occurs when the difference between the angles of any two planets is divisible by 360. We should calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all pairwise velocities to determine the cycle in which they align. If the GCD divides 360, it means those planets will align periodically. We then determine how many times alignments occur within Z days.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b) {
        int t = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = t;
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> velocities(N);
    std::vector<int> days(360, 0); // To keep track of alignments each day

    // Read velocities and pre-calculate the gcd of differences
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> velocities[i];
    }

    // Calculate the number of days when at least P planets align
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
            int velocity_diff = std::abs(velocities[i] - velocities[j]);
            int cycle_days = 360 / gcd(360, velocity_diff); // Cycle for this pair to align
            
            for (int k = cycle_days; k <= Z; k += cycle_days) {
                days[k]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Count the number of alignment occurrences
    int alignments = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        if (days[day] >= P * (P - 1) / 2) { // Combinatorial pairing for P planets
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the GCD of the difference in velocities for all pairs of planets and determines the number of days it takes for each pair to align. It then counts how many pairs are aligned on each day up to Z days and checks if that meets or exceeds the threshold necessary for an alignment of P planets (which is P choose 2 pairs). The final count of alignments is then written to the output file.

The previous solution still did not correctly calculate the number of alignments because it incorrectly counted the number of paired alignments instead of the total number of planets aligned. To correct this, we should not only count the number of pairs aligned on a given day but also identify the specific days when at least `P` planets align.

The solution involves calculating the angular position of each planet for every day up to `Z` and comparing them to check for alignments. We can use the modulo operation to normalize the angular positions and count the number of planets that share the same position on each day.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");
    
    int N, P, Z, V;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;

    // Using a vector of vectors to store the positions on each day for each planet
    std::vector<std::vector<bool>> positions(360, std::vector<bool>(N, false));

    // Read the velocities and mark the positions on each day for each planet
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> V;
        for (int day = 0; day < Z; ++day) {
            int pos = (day * V) % 360;
            positions[pos][i] = true;
        }
    }

    // Count alignments
    int alignments = 0;
    for (int day = 0; day < Z; ++day) {
        int alignment_count = 0;
        for (int pos = 0; pos < 360; ++pos) {
            int count = std::count(positions[pos].begin(), positions[pos].end(), true);
            if (count >= P) {
                alignment_count++;
                break; // If we found an alignment, no need to check other positions for the same day
            }
        }
        alignments += alignment_count;
    }

    fout << alignments << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a 2D vector `positions` to store which planets are at each of the 360 possible positions on each day. For each day, we count the number of planets at each position. If the count is greater than or equal to `P`, we consider it an alignment. We increment the `alignments` counter each time we find such an alignment. Finally, we output the total number of alignments to the file.

The previous attempts didn't properly address the issue because they either incorrectly counted the number of paired alignments or checked each day's alignments individually, which isn't efficient and can lead to incorrect results due to the misunderstanding of the problem conditions. We should ensure that we count the number of alignments correctly by considering the alignments of at least `P` planets after each day up to `Z` days.

The problem can be solved more efficiently by using the concept of least common multiple (LCM) to find the periodicity of alignments for each planet pair. For each pair of planets, we find the LCM of their velocities, which gives us the number of days it will take for those two planets to align again relative to the star. We then count how often such alignments happen within `Z` days.

Here's a correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return a / gcd(a, b) * b;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> velocities(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> velocities[i];
    }

    // We'll count the number of days that have at least P alignments
    int alignment_days = 0;

    // Check each day for possible alignments
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        int alignments = 0;

        // Check each planet against every other planet
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
                int planet_lcm = lcm(velocities[i], velocities[j]);

                // If the current day is a multiple of the LCM, these two planets align
                if (day % planet_lcm == 0) {
                    ++alignments;
                }
            }
        }

        // Check if the number of pairwise alignments equals or exceeds the combinatorial number for P planets
        if (alignments >= P * (P - 1) / 2) {
            ++alignment_days;
        }
    }

    fout << alignment_days << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we:
1. Read the velocities of the planets.
2. Loop through each day up to `Z` days to check for alignments.
3. For each day, we loop through all pairs of planets, calculating their LCM to determine if they align on that day.
4. If the number of pairwise alignments is at least as many as are needed for `P` planets to align (calculated by the formula `P * (P - 1) / 2`), we count that day as an alignment day.
5. At the end, we write the total number of alignment days to the output file.

This should produce the correct number of alignment days, as requested.

The previous solution incorrectly finds the least common multiple (LCM) for each pair of planets and attempts to count pairwise alignments. This method fails because it does not properly account for alignments that involve more than two planets, and it also does not accurately determine the days on which at least `P` planets are aligned.

The correct way to approach this problem is to calculate the days on which each planet returns to its original position (a multiple of 360 degrees), which occurs at a frequency that is the LCM of the planet's rotation period (360 degrees divided by the rotation velocity). By finding these days for each planet, we can calculate how often they align with the star and other planets.

To efficiently solve the problem, we can use a count of how many planets are in their initial positions on each day. If this count is greater than or equal to `P`, we have an alignment.

Here is the revised solution, which counts the number of alignments correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

// Function to calculate GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z, v, alignments = 0;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> days(360, 0); // Store the count of planets aligned with the star each day

    // Read the velocity for each planet and calculate the days on which they align with the star
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> v;
        int period = 360 / gcd(360, v); // The period is when the planet aligns with the star
        for (int day = period; day <= Z; day += period) {
            ++days[day % 360]; // Use modulo 360 because of the circular nature
        }
    }

    // Calculate the number of days where at least P planets are aligned with the star
    for (int i = 1; i <= Z; ++i) {
        if (days[i % 360] >= P - 1) { // Subtract 1 because we include the star in the alignment
            ++alignments;
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we calculate the number of days where at least `P` planets are aligned with the star. We use the `days` vector to track how many planets align with the star each day. We do not count the day itself if the day modulo 360 is 0, because that corresponds to the initial horizontal alignment that all planets have on day 0. By iterating through the days and checking the alignment count, we can determine the total number of alignment days correctly. This code should output the expected number of alignments for the given input.

I apologize for the confusion in the previous attempts. Let's re-evaluate the problem and provide a correct solution.

To solve this problem, we must consider every day from 1 to Z and check for alignments by counting how many planets are at the same angle relative to the star. We are given that the rotation speeds in degrees per day, which means that a planet with a speed of V degrees per day will return to its initial position every L = 360 / gcd(360, V) days, where gcd stands for the greatest common divisor. On those days, that planet aligns with the star.

Rather than calculating pairwise alignments, we should directly count the number of planets aligned with the star each day. We can do this by incrementing counts in an array indexed by the angle (0 to 359) whenever a planet is at that angle.

Here's the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

// Function to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> velocities(N);

    // Reading the velocities
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> velocities[i];
    }

    int alignments = 0;
    int lcm_all = 1;

    // Find the LCM of all planets' rotation periods
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int rotation_period = 360 / gcd(360, velocities[i]);
        lcm_all = (lcm_all * rotation_period) / gcd(lcm_all, rotation_period);
    }

    // Calculate the number of unique days when at least P planets align with the star
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        int count_aligned = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if ((day * velocities[i]) % 360 == 0) {
                count_aligned++;
            }
        }
        if (count_aligned >= P) {
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the LCM of all planet rotation periods to optimize the day check loop. For each day, it counts the number of planets aligned with the star. If this count is greater than or equal to P, we increment our alignments counter. We then print the number of alignments to the output file.

This adjusted solution should correctly solve the given problem and produce the expected number of alignments.

Let's approach the problem in a different way. We need to find alignments of at least P planets at the end of each day for Z days. Since we're dealing with circular motion, each planet's angular position resets after 360 degrees. The angular position of each planet at the end of a day is given by `(V * day) % 360`.

An alignment occurs when the angular positions of at least P planets are the same modulo 360. To find alignments, we can iterate through each day from 1 to Z and use an array to count the number of planets at each angular position for that day. If the count for any position reaches P, we have an alignment for that day.

Here's the revised solution, with the correct logic to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    fin >> N >> P >> Z;
    std::vector<int> velocities(N);
    std::vector<int> positions(360, 0);
    int alignments = 0;

    // Reading the velocities
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> velocities[i];
    }

    fin.close();

    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        std::fill(positions.begin(), positions.end(), 0);  // Reset positions for the new day

        // Count the number of planets at each position
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            // Calculate the angular position of the planet for the current day
            int angle = (velocities[i] * day) % 360;
            positions[angle]++;
        }

        // Check if we have at least P planets aligned at any position
        for (int i = 0; i < 360; ++i) {
            if (positions[i] >= P) {
                alignments++;
                break;  // Stop checking other positions as we found an alignment
            }
        }
    }

    fout << alignments << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we iterate through each day and calculate the angular position for each planet. We then count the number of planets at each angle. If there's any angle where at least P planets are aligned, we consider that an alignment for the day.

This should provide the expected number of alignments for the given problem.
