Se consideră modelul unui sistem solar format din $N$ planete care se rotesc în jurul unei stele $S$, în sens trigonometric. Traiectoriile planetelor se consideră circulare și de raze diferite, iar vitezele de rotație ale planetelor în jurul stelei sunt numere naturale și sunt exprimate în grade pe zi ($\degree$/zi).

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de planete $N$ și vitezele lor de rotație $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, precum și două numere naturale $P$ și $Z$, să se determine numărul $A$ de alinieri a câte minimum $P$ planete, pe o dreaptă ce trece prin centrul stelei $S$, după trecerea celor $Z$ zile. Evoluția sistemului solar începe cu toate planetele așezate orizontal, în dreapta stelei $S$.
\
Spre exemplu, pentru $N=4$, $P=3$, $Z=365$ și $V = [20, 11, 8, 6]$, alinierea a minimum $3$ planete din cele $4$ se va face la finalul zilelor $60$, $90$, $120$, $180$, $240$, $270$, $300$, $360$. După $365$ de zile vor exista $A=8$ alinieri. În imaginea din dreapta se observă poziția planetelor la prima aliniere.
~[1.jpg|align=center|width=55em]

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `alinieri.in` conține pe prima linie, în această ordine, numerele naturale $N$, $P$ și $Z$, iar pe a doua linie, $N$ numere naturale $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$ cu semnificația de mai sus. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `alinieri.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul $A$, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq P \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Z \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq V_i \leq 10^3$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq Z \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $2 \leq P \leq 9$.
- Se vor lua în considerare doar alinierile de la sfârșitul fiecărei zile (ora 24:00), când planetele și-au încheiat parcursul zilnic.

The provided code includes an efficient solution to the problem. It uses the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the cycle of alignments between each pair of planets, and it tracks the days with at least one alignment. Then, it iterates through these marked days to count the number of alignments involving at least the minimum number of planets specified (P).

Here's a breakdown of how the algorithm works:

1. The `gcd` function computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is used to calculate the normalized rotation speed and the LCM.

2. The `lcm` function computes the least common multiple of two numbers, which determines the cycle at which two planets align.

3. The `count_alignments` function first calculates the alignment cycles for all pairs of planets and marks the days when at least one alignment occurs. Then, for each marked day, it counts the number of planets aligned and checks if it meets the minimum required for counting an alignment.

4. In the `main` function, the program reads the input from `alinieri.in`, normalizes the rotation speeds to simplify calculations, and then calls `count_alignments` to determine the total number of alignments over Z days.

5. Finally, the program writes the result to `alinieri.out` and closes the input and output files.

I apologize for the error in the initial solution. Upon reviewing the code and the problem, I realize that the algorithm needs to be fixed. The logic employed with the LCM approach is not correctly accounting for alignments involving more than two planets. Instead, it's essential to iterate over each day and check alignments per day. Let's fix the solution and apply a different approach.

We will calculate the angular position of each planet at the end of each day, and then check for alignments. Since the planets align if their angular positions differ by multiples of 360 degrees, we can normalize the angle of each planet to a range of 0-359 degrees by using the modulus operator. We will then count how many planets align for each day and if the count meets or exceeds the minimum required for an alignment, we increment our alignment counter.

Here's the updated solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream output("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    input >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> speeds(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        input >> speeds[i];
    }

    input.close();

    int alignments = 0;

    // For each day, check the alignment of planets
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        std::vector<int> positions(360, 0); // To count planets at each angle

        // Calculate position for each planet
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int position = (speeds[i] * day) % 360;
            positions[position]++;
        }

        // Check for alignments
        for (int pos : positions) {
            if (pos >= P) {
                alignments++;
                break; // Only count once per day
            }
        }
    }

    output << alignments << "\n";
    output.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates through each day, calculates the positions for each planet, and checks if the minimum number of planets (P) are aligned on that day. If so, we increment the alignment counter. The results are then written to `alinieri.out`. This algorithm is straightforward and should be fast enough given the constraints of the problem.

The previous solution is incorrectly counting the alignments—it only counts days where any angle has at least `P` planets, but it does not consider that different groups of `P` planets can align at different angles on the same day.

To address this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) for all the differences between pairs of planets' speeds. The GCD will give us the smallest degree increment at which any alignment can happen. We can then check for alignments at every multiple of this GCD up to 360 degrees.

Here is the revised and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream output("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    input >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> speeds(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        input >> speeds[i];
    }

    input.close();

    // Find the GCD of all speeds to determine the degree increment for alignments
    int degree_increment = speeds[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        degree_increment = gcd(degree_increment, speeds[i]);
    }

    // Find alignments by checking each day for each possible degree
    int alignments = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        std::vector<int> degree_count(360 / degree_increment, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int position = (speeds[i] * day) % 360;
            degree_count[position / degree_increment]++;
        }
        for (int count : degree_count) {
            if (count >= P) {
                alignments++;
                break; // Count each alignment only once per day
            }
        }
    }

    output << alignments << "\n";
    output.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This updated solution first calculates the GCD of all planet speeds as the smallest degree increment where an alignment can occur. It then counts alignments by iterating over each day, and for each day, incrementing a count for the position of each planet normalized by the degree increment. If any degree position's count reaches at least `P` within a day, we record an alignment for that day. The total number of alignments is then output to `alinieri.out`.

Upon reviewing the previous solutions and the requirements of the challenge, it is clear that the approach to solving the problem must be revised. The key to solving this challenge is to compute the periods at which each planet aligns with the star and then find the number of unique days when at least `P` planets align.

The following steps will be taken to solve the challenge:

1. Calculate the period of alignment for each planet, which is the number of days it takes for the planet to complete a full 360-degree rotation and return to the initial position. This period is given by `360 / gcd(360, V_i)`, where `V_i` is the rotational speed of the `i`-th planet.
   
2. Find all unique days when at least one planet aligns with the star within `Z` days.

3. For each of these days, count the number of planets that align with the star.

4. If the count is greater than or equal to `P`, increment the total alignment count.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <unordered_set>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream output("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    input >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> periods(N);
    std::unordered_set<int> alignment_days;

    // Calculate periods and store all alignment days
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int speed;
        input >> speed;
        periods[i] = 360 / gcd(360, speed);
        // Store alignment days for each planet
        for (int d = periods[i]; d <= Z; d += periods[i]) {
            alignment_days.insert(d);
        }
    }
    input.close();

    // Count unique alignment days when at least P planets align
    int alignments = 0;
    for (int day : alignment_days) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (day % periods[i] == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count >= P) {
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    output << alignments << "\n";
    output.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly count the number of unique days when at least `P` planets are aligned, and it outputs the result to `alinieri.out`.

It appears the previous solutions still failed to produce the correct output. I apologize for the oversight. The challenge requires counting the number of unique days when at least `P` planets align with the star after a full day's rotation. To do this correctly, we need a different approach.

We will:

1. Compute the angle each planet will be at after `Z` days.
2. Sort these angles to simplify finding alignments.
3. For each day, check for alignments by comparing each planet's angle with the others.
4. When an alignment is found, record the day and continue checking for additional alignments on that day.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAX_DEGREES = 360;

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream output("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    input >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> speeds(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        input >> speeds[i];
    }
    input.close();

    int alignments = 0;
    std::vector<int> days_to_align(MAX_DEGREES, 0);

    // Calculate for each planet the days it aligns with the star
    for (int speed : speeds) {
        int period = MAX_DEGREES / std::gcd(MAX_DEGREES, speed);
        for (int day = period; day <= Z; day += period) {
            days_to_align[day % MAX_DEGREES]++;
        }
    }

    // Count the days where at least P planets align
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        if (days_to_align[day % MAX_DEGREES] >= P) {
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    output << alignments << std::endl;
    output.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution:

- We first read the number of planets `N`, the minimum number of planets required for alignment `P`, and the total number of days `Z` from `alinieri.in`.
- We calculate the days on which each planet aligns with the star based on its speed and store this information in `days_to_align`.
- We iterate over each day from 1 to `Z` and check if the number of planets aligning on that day is at least `P` by using the `days_to_align` array.
- Finally, we write the total number of alignment days `alignments` to `alinieri.out`.

The error message indicates that the `std::gcd` function is not recognized by the compiler. This can happen if the version of C++ standard library in use does not support this C++17 feature, or if the appropriate header is not included. To fix this, we can either implement our own `gcd` function or include the `numeric` header which provides `std::gcd` in C++17 and later.

Since it's not guaranteed that C++17 is enabled, I'll provide our own implementation of the `gcd` function and use it in the solution.

Here is the revised solution with the fix applied:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAX_DEGREES = 360;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {

    std::vector<int> speeds(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {

    }
    input.close();

    int alignments = 0;
    std::vector<int> days_to_align(MAX_DEGREES, 0);

    // Calculate for each planet the days it aligns with the star
    for (int speed : speeds) {
        int period = MAX_DEGREES / gcd(MAX_DEGREES, speed);
        for (int day = period; day <= Z; day += period) {
            days_to_align[day % MAX_DEGREES]++;
        }
    }

    // Count the days where at least P planets align
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        if (days_to_align[day % MAX_DEGREES] >= P) {
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    output << alignments << std::endl;
    output.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution includes our own `gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It is then used to calculate the period at which each planet aligns with the star. The rest of the code remains the same, and should now compile and run correctly, producing the expected output.

I apologize for the previous errors. It seems there was a misunderstanding of how to track alignments. Specifically, the code was incorrectly incrementing alignment counts on the modulus of the day instead of the actual day.

We need to track the specific days when each planet aligns with the star, and then count how many such days have alignments of at least `P` planets.

To do this correctly, we will:

1. Calculate the period at which each planet aligns with the star.
2. Use an array or vector to count the number of planets aligning on each day.
3. Iterate through the days, count the number of planets aligning on that day, and if it's at least `P`, increment the alignment count.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream output("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    input >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> speeds(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        input >> speeds[i];
    }
    input.close();

    int alignments = 0;
    std::vector<int> planet_alignment_count(Z + 1, 0);

    // Calculate the periods and increment the corresponding day counters
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int period = 360 / gcd(360, speeds[i]);
        for (int k = period; k <= Z; k += period) {
            planet_alignment_count[k]++;
        }
    }

    // Count the days where at least P planets align
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        if (planet_alignment_count[day] >= P) {
            alignments++;
        }
    }

    output << alignments << "\n";
    output.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code uses the `gcd` function to calculate the period of each planet's rotation. Then, for each planet, it increments the count of planet alignments on each day that the planet completes an orbit. After processing all planets, the code iterates through the days up to `Z` and counts the number of days where the alignment count meets or exceeds `P`. This corrected count is then written to the output file `alinieri.out`.
