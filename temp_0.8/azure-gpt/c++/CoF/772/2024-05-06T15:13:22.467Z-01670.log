Upon reviewing the output, it's clear that there is a mistake in the generation of the sequence for terms beyond the initial 17 provided. The rule for the sequence is not evident from the initial terms alone, so let's try to deduce it by looking for patterns:

Looking at the sequence:
$1$, $2$, $3$, $5$, $8$, $3$, $1$, $4$, $5$, $9$, $4$, $3$, $7$, $0$, $7$, $7$, $4$,...

I notice that the sequence seems to be the sum of the last term and the last digit of the sequence repeated after the 17th term. But taking a closer look, the provided sequence doesn't follow this pattern strictly. It seems there's an error in my initial implementation: the sequence generation logic after the 17th term is incorrect. Instead, we should analyze the sequence further to deduce the correct rule.

Unfortunately, the challenge does not provide enough information to deduce the exact rule based on which the sequence is generated. Therefore, without additional information or more terms of the sequence, it's impossible to derive the correct rule programmatically.

Given the current information, I will refactor the code, correct the prime number sum, and digit occurrence counting, and add an assumption for the sequence generation that it repeats every 6 terms after the 17th term based on the available data:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

bool is_prime(int num) {
    if (num == 0 || num == 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; ++i)
        if (num % i == 0)
            return false;
    return true;
}

int digit_occurrence(int num, int digit) {
    int count = 0;
    while (num) {
        if (num % 10 == digit) ++count;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("nr.in");
    std::ofstream out("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    in >> n >> k >> p;
    in.close();

    int sum_primes = 0, count_k = 0, pth_term = 0;
    std::vector<int> sequence = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4};

    // Process the first 17 terms
    for (int i = 0; i < n && i < 17; ++i) {
        if (is_prime(sequence[i])) sum_primes += sequence[i];
        count_k += digit_occurrence(sequence[i], k);
    }

    // Generate more terms if needed
    int last_term = sequence[16];
    for (int i = 17; i < n; ++i) {
        // Assuming a repeating pattern every 6 terms
        int next_term = sequence[(i - 17) % 6 + 11]; // The pattern starts with the 12th element
        if (is_prime(next_term)) sum_primes += next_term;
        count_k += digit_occurrence(next_term, k);
        sequence.push_back(next_term);
        last_term = next_term;
    }

    // Find the p-th term
    if (p <= 17) {
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1];
    } else {
        // Assuming the same repeating pattern every 6 terms after the 17th
        pth_term = sequence[(p - 17 - 1) % 6 + 11]; // The pattern starts with the 12th element
    }

    // Output the results
    out << sum_primes << '\n';
    out << count_k << '\n';
    out << pth_term << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code assumes that there is a repeating pattern starting from the 12th element every 6 terms after the 17th term. If this assumption is incorrect, then without a proper rule for the sequence, a correct solution cannot be provided. The code fixes issues with the prime sum and digit occurrence but may still fail if the actual sequence generation rule differs.

Upon examining the expected output and the found output, there are two discrepancies:

1. The sum of prime numbers found was 52 instead of the expected 47. This indicates that there might be incorrect identification of prime numbers in the sequence.
2. The number of appearances of the digit 5 is 2, whereas the expected count is 3. It suggests that there might be an error in the logic for counting the digit occurrences.
3. The found p-th term was 0, while the expected term is 8. This indicates that the pattern for generating terms beyond the 17th is incorrect.

To address these discrepancies, let's go through each of the issues:

1. Sum of prime numbers: Re-examine the `is_prime` function to ensure that it correctly identifies prime numbers.
2. Count of digit k: Revisit the logic for counting digit occurrences to ensure it captures all instances of the digit k in the sequence.
3. Generation of the sequence: The initial assumption that the sequence repeats every 6 terms after the 17th term is incorrect. We need to revise the pattern for generating terms after the 17th term.

After looking again at the provided sequence, it appears that the next term is the last digit of the sum of the last two terms:

$1$, $2$, $3$, $5$, $8$, $3$, $1$, $4$, $5$, $9$, $4$, $3$, $7$, $0$, $7$, $7$, $4$,...

The next term (18th) should be the last digit of 7 + 4 = 11, which is 1, and so on. This pattern can generate the entire sequence beyond the provided terms.

Let's rewrite the solution considering the correct pattern for the sequence generation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; ++i)
        if (num % i == 0)
            return false;
    return true;
}

// Function to count occurrences of a digit in the sequence
int count_digit_occurrences(const std::vector<int>& sequence, int n, int digit) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (sequence[i] == digit) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("nr.in");
    std::ofstream out("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    in >> n >> k >> p;
    in.close();

    // Given sequence
    std::vector<int> sequence = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4};

    // Generate the sequence for n terms
    while (sequence.size() < n) {
        sequence.push_back((sequence[sequence.size() - 1] + sequence[sequence.size() - 2]) % 10);
    }

    // Calculate the sum of prime numbers in the sequence
    int sum_primes = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (is_prime(sequence[i])) {
            sum_primes += sequence[i];
        }
    }

    // Count the occurrences of digit k
    int count_k = count_digit_occurrences(sequence, n, k);

    // Get the p-th term of the sequence
    int pth_term;
    // If p is within the generated sequence, retrieve it directly
    if (p <= sequence.size()) {
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1];
    } else {
        // Otherwise, use the pattern to predict the p-th term
        int idx = (p - 1) % sequence.size();
        pth_term = sequence[idx];
    }

    // Output the results to the file
    out << sum_primes << '\n';
    out << count_k << '\n';
    out << pth_term << '\n';

    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This updated solution should now correctly count the sum of prime numbers, the occurrences of digit k, and generate the p-th term according to the new pattern deduced for the sequence.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output lies in the calculation of the p-th term. The expected p-th term is 8, while the found output is 1. The current approach of using the pattern repetition and the modulus operation to find the p-th term seems to be incorrect, so I will review and fix that part of the solution.

The sequence is generated by summing the last two terms and taking the last digit of the result as the next term. The sequence starts repeating after a certain point. However, it's not enough to take the modulo of p with the size of the generated sequence because the sequence does not repeat from the beginning but follows the pattern established by the last two terms of the provided sequence.

We need to find the p-th term by continuing the pattern from where we left off. If p is greater than `n`, we can calculate the p-th term by continuing to add the last two terms and taking the last digit until we reach the p-th term.

Let's correct the code to find the p-th term using the pattern:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int num) {
    if (num < 2) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; ++i)
        if (num % i == 0)
            return false;
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("nr.in");
    std::ofstream out("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    in >> n >> k >> p;
    in.close();

    // Initial sequence
    std::vector<int> sequence = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4};

    // Calculate the sum of primes and the k occurrences for the first 17 terms
    int sum_primes = 0, count_k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 17 && i < n; ++i) {
        if (is_prime(sequence[i])) {
            sum_primes += sequence[i];
        }
        if (sequence[i] == k) {
            count_k++;
        }
    }

    // Extend the sequence and update prime sum and k occurrences if n > 17
    for (int i = 17; i < n; ++i) {
        int next_term = (sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]) % 10;
        sequence.push_back(next_term);
        if (is_prime(next_term)) {
            sum_primes += next_term;
        }
        if (next_term == k) {
            count_k++;
        }
    }

    // Get the p-th term
    int pth_term = 0;
    if (p <= n) {
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1];
    } else {
        int last = sequence[n - 1];
        int second_last = sequence[n - 2];
        for (int i = n; i < p; ++i) {
            pth_term = (last + second_last) % 10;
            second_last = last;
            last = pth_term;
        }
    }

    // Write the output
    out << sum_primes << '\n';
    out << count_k << '\n';
    out << pth_term << '\n';

    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

With this updated code, the p-th term should now be calculated correctly, matching the expected output. Additionally, the calculation of prime sum and the occurrences of digit k is done correctly as verified by the expected output.
