Note: For maximum efficiency, especially for large values of `p`, we should optimize the generation of the `p`-th term by recognizing that the sequence repeats every 60 terms. However, the provided solution is sufficient for the constraints given (n up to 100, p up to 2 * 10^9) due to the modulo operation efficiently calculating the p-th term.

The provided solution has a mistake in generating the sequence of numbers. The sequence is based on a Fibonacci-like progression but taken modulo 10. However, the initial sequence provided seems to suggest a more complex pattern or a different rule because it is not following the simple modulo 10 Fibonacci sequence starting from 1 and 2.

Let's carefully analyze the initial sequence given:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4,...
```

Here, we see that it starts like a Fibonacci sequence but diverges after the fifth term. The rules for the sequence are not explicitly given, so let's try to deduce them by looking for a repeating pattern. By examining the sequence, we can notice that after the first 15 numbers (1 to 0), the sequence starts repeating the digits from the start with the exception of the first two numbers (1 and 2). Therefore, the sequence can be considered periodic with a period that starts from the third element. The length of the period is 15—starting from the third element to the seventeenth.

To fix the solution, we need to adjust the code to generate the sequence by following the correct rule, as well as calculate the p-th term based on this repeating pattern. Let's rewrite the solution considering these findings:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int n) {
    if(n < 2) return false;
    for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i)
        if(n % i == 0) return false;
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");
    
    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    // The repeating pattern starting from the third element
    std::vector<int> pattern = {1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 1};
    int prime_sum = 0, k_count = 0, pth_term = 0, digit;

    // Process the first n terms of the sequence
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        // Special case for the first two terms
        if (i == 1) {
            digit = 1;
        } else if (i == 2) {
            digit = 2;
        } else {
            // Regular case based on the repeating pattern
            digit = pattern[(i - 3) % pattern.size()];
        }

        // Count primes
        if(is_prime(digit)) {
            prime_sum += digit;
        }

        // Count occurrences of k
        if(digit == k) {
            ++k_count;
        }
    }

    // Determine the p-th term
    if (p == 1) {
        pth_term = 1;
    } else if (p == 2) {
        pth_term = 2;
    } else {
        pth_term = pattern[(p - 3) % pattern.size()];
    }

    // Write output
    outfile << prime_sum << '\n';
    outfile << k_count << '\n';
    outfile << pth_term << '\n';

    // Close files
    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we have a vector `pattern` that contains the digits of the periodic part of the sequence. When calculating the prime sum and k count, we consider the first two elements as special cases. For determining the `p`-th term, we also consider the first two elements and then use the pattern to find the digit at position `p`. This approach should provide the correct output according to the challenge description and the example provided.

The previous solution incorrectly computed the prime sum, the count of the digit k, and the p-th term of the sequence. The main issue was that the repeating pattern was not identified correctly. Given the initial sequence, let's try to determine the correct repeating pattern and re-implement the solution.

The initial sequence provided in the challenge is:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4,...
```

From this, we can understand that the sequence is not strictly Fibonacci modulo 10. However, we can see a pattern emerging after the 16th element where `7 + 7 mod 10 = 4` and the following term `7 + 4 mod 10 = 1` which coincides with the pattern from the start, making us believe that the sequence might repeat every 16th term, but starting from the 3rd term.

To confirm this, let's examine if the sequence does repeat every 16th term starting from the 3rd term:
```
3rd term: 3, and 17th term: 4 (3 + 1)
4th term: 5, and 18th term: 5 (4 + 1)
5th term: 8, and 19th term: 9 (5 + 4)
```

It appears that the sequence is actually the sum of the previous two terms plus 1, which is then taken modulo 10. This would mean the pattern starts repeating after the 16th term. 

Here is the corrected solution with the new pattern:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i)
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    int prime_sum = 0, k_count = 0, pth_term = 0;
    std::vector<int> sequence;
    sequence.reserve(n);

    // Start with the first two given terms
    sequence.push_back(1);
    sequence.push_back(2);

    // Generate the sequence up to the n-th term
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        int next = (sequence[i - 3] + sequence[i - 2] + 1) % 10;
        sequence.push_back(next);
    }

    // Calculate prime sum and count k occurrences
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (is_prime(sequence[i])) {
            prime_sum += sequence[i];
        }
        if (sequence[i] == k) {
            k_count++;
        }
    }

    // Determine the p-th term using the pattern (p-1 because of 0-indexing)
    if (p == 1) {
        pth_term = 1;
    } else if (p == 2) {
        pth_term = 2;
    } else {
        pth_term = (sequence[(p - 3) % 16] + sequence[(p - 2) % 16] + 1) % 10;
    }

    // Write the output to the file
    outfile << prime_sum << '\n';
    outfile << k_count << '\n';
    outfile << pth_term << '\n';

    // Closing files
    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
This re-implemented solution generates the sequence based on the sum of the two previous terms plus 1 modulo 10, calculates the prime sum, the count of digit k, and computes the p-th term using the period of the sequence, which is now understood to be 16 starting from the 3rd term. This should provide the correct output for the given challenge.

Upon re-evaluation, it seems the sequence is not purely Fibonacci with an added one and taken modulo 10. The provided values and expected output suggest that we need to identify a different rule or pattern.

The initial terms given are:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, ...
```

From the given sequence, it looks like the sequence is being generated by some form of rule that is not immediately apparent. There is not enough information to deduce a mathematical pattern that can generate the subsequent terms based on the previous ones. Without further information, we cannot programmatically generate the rest of the sequence.

Given the challenge, we are asked to find the sum of prime numbers, the number of occurrences of a digit k, and the p-th term within the first n terms of the series. Since the series appears to not follow a clear pattern and the constraints are small (n is at most 100), we can manually input the series up to the 100th term if it can be provided or inferred.

The expected output for the input `19 5 26` suggests that the 26th term should be 8. However, without the rule or full sequence, we cannot determine why the 26th term is 8. The primes in the first 19 terms should sum up to 47, which suggests that we are missing some prime numbers in the calculation.

Let's re-implement the program incorporating the correct sequence up to the 100th term if it's known, or use a different approach if the pattern can be deduced.

Since the pattern or full sequence is not provided in the challenge description, we are unable to continue with a correct implementation. If you could provide the correct pattern or the full sequence up to the 100th term, I would be happy to assist with the correct implementation.

---------- assistant ----------

The error message indicates that there is a numeric constant at the beginning of the source file (`main.cpp`) which is not part of any statement or declaration. This looks like an accidental paste of the sequence into the source code file, which is not valid C++ syntax. The sequence should not be in the code file outside of a function or without being part of an initialization for a data structure, such as an array or a vector.

To fix this, we need to properly include the sequence within a data structure like an array or vector, and then write the program logic around it. Since we do not have the full sequence or the pattern to generate it, I will write a program structure that assumes the sequence is stored in an array or vector with placeholder values.

Let's write a program that expects to have the sequence filled up to the 100th term:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n == 2) return true;
    if (n % 2 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    // Placeholder sequence - this needs to be filled with the correct terms up to the 100th term
    std::vector<int> sequence = {/* 1st to 100th terms of the sequence go here */};

    int prime_sum = 0, k_count = 0, pth_term = 0;

    // Calculate prime sum and count k occurrences within the first n terms
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (is_prime(sequence[i])) {
            prime_sum += sequence[i];
        }
        if (sequence[i] == k) {
            k_count++;
        }
    }

    // Determine the p-th term
    if (p <= sequence.size()) {
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1];
    } else {
        // If the sequence is known to repeat, calculate p-th term using that knowledge
        // Otherwise, we need the full sequence or the rule to generate it
        // pth_term = sequence[(p - 1) % period_length] // if sequence is periodic
    }

    // Write the output to the file
    outfile << prime_sum << '\n';
    outfile << k_count << '\n';
    outfile << pth_term << '\n';

    // Closing files
    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This program structure assumes that we have the full sequence available up to the 100th term. If the sequence is periodic, then we could calculate the `p-th` term using the period of the sequence. However, without the full sequence or the rule to generate it, we cannot complete the implementation. If the full sequence or pattern rule is provided, the placeholder in the `sequence` vector should be replaced with the actual terms.

---------- assistant ----------

An exit code of 139 typically indicates that a segmentation fault has occurred. This type of error is commonly caused by accessing memory that the program does not have permission to access. In the context of the provided program structure, this could have happened due to an attempt to access elements outside the bounds of the `sequence` vector, especially because the vector is currently uninitialized and does not contain any elements.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `sequence` vector is initialized with the correct sequence of values. However, because we don't have the full sequence or the rules for generating it, we cannot accurately populate the `sequence` vector. For the purpose of writing a compilable and runnable program, we can initialize the `sequence` vector with dummy values. In a real-world scenario, we would need the actual sequence or generation rules.

Here is the revised solution, with a dummy initialization of the `sequence` vector that prevents accessing out-of-bounds memory:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n == 2) return true;
    if (n % 2 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    // Dummy initialization with 100 elements set to 1 (as we do not have the actual sequence)
    std::vector<int> sequence(100, 1);

    int prime_sum = 0, k_count = 0, pth_term = 0;

    // Calculate prime sum and count k occurrences within the first n terms
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (is_prime(sequence[i])) {
            prime_sum += sequence[i];
        }
        if (sequence[i] == k) {
            k_count++;
        }
    }

    // Determine the p-th term
    if (p <= sequence.size()) {
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1];
    } else {
        // Handle cases where p is beyond the initialized sequence
        // This would typically use the periodicity of the sequence or the generation rule
        // pth_term = sequence[(p - 1) % period_length] // if sequence is periodic
        // Since we have dummy data, we can simply return 1
        pth_term = 1;
    }

    // Write the output to the file
    outfile << prime_sum << '\n';
    outfile << k_count << '\n';
    outfile << pth_term << '\n';

    // Closing files
    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This program now initializes the `sequence` vector with 100 elements, all set to 1. This initialization prevents segmentation faults caused by accessing the vector out of bounds. However, the `sequence` initialization is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual sequence values once they are available. Additionally, the logic for calculating the `p-th` term is commented out, as it would require knowledge of the sequence's periodicity or generation rules.

The differences between the expected and found results are due to the use of dummy data in the `sequence` vector. Since the vector was initialized with all elements set to 1, the program incorrectly calculated the sum of prime numbers as 0, the count of digit `k` as 0, and the `p-th` term as 1. This discrepancy arises because the actual sequence was not used in the calculation.

The expected output indicates that among the first 19 terms, there is a sum of 47 for all prime numbers, the digit 5 appears 3 times, and the 26th term of the sequence is 8.

To address this issue, we must use the actual sequence given in the problem statement to calculate the correct results. Since we don't know the full sequence or the rule to generate it, I will use the initial terms provided and assume that the sequence is repeating with those initial 16 terms. This assumption is based on the information given in the problem statement and the expected output for the example input.

Let's provide an implementation based on this assumption:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n == 2) return true;
    if (n % 2 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 3; i <= std::sqrt(n); i += 2) {
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    // The initial sequence provided, assumed to be repeating
    std::vector<int> sequence = {
        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4,
        // ... (continue the known pattern, if available, or repeat from the third term)
    };

    // Extend the sequence if a pattern is identified or more terms are known.
    // For demonstration purposes, the sequence is assumed to repeat every 16 terms after the first two.
    int base_pattern_size = sequence.size();
    for (int i = base_pattern_size; i < 100; ++i) {
        sequence.push_back(sequence[(i - base_pattern_size + 2) % base_pattern_size]);
    }

This implementation assumes that after the initial 16 terms, the sequence repeats. It extends the known pattern to 100 terms, providing enough terms for the range specified in the problem (`n` up to 100). The calculations for the sum of primes, count of digit `k`, and `p-th` term are then based on the repeating sequence.

Please note that if the sequence does not actually repeat every 16 terms after the first two, or if there is a specific rule to generate the terms that we are not provided with, this implementation would not be accurate and would need to be adjusted accordingly.
