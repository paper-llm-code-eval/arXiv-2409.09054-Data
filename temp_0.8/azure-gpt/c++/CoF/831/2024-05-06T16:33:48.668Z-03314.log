Ana și Bogdan au găsit la bunicul lor o cutie cu $N$ bețe de aceeași lungime. După câteva minute de joacă urmează cearta. Bunicul le-a propus să rupă cele $N$ bețe și apoi Ana să primească fragmentele din mâna stângă, iar Bogdan fragmentele din mâna dreaptă. Zis și făcut. Copiii au luat fragmentele, le-au numerotat fiecare cu numere de la $1$ la $N$, le-au măsurat și acum își doresc să lipească fragmentele primite, dar mai au nevoie de câteva informații.

# Cerință

Cunoscând $N$ numărul de bețe, $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_N$ lungimile fragmentelor primite de Ana și $B_1$, $B_2$, ..., $B_N$ lungimile fragmentelor primite de Bogdan, să se scrie un program care să determine:

* lungimea inițială a bețelor;
* lungimea celui mai lung băț care se poate obține prin lipirea unui fragment aparținând Anei cu un fragment care aparține lui Bogdan;
* numărul bețelor de lungime maximă care se pot obține prin lipirea unui fragment aparținând Anei cu un fragment care aparține lui Bogdan.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `bete.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$ reprezentând numărul de bețe. Pe a doua linie sunt $N$ numere naturale $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_N$ reprezentând lungimile fragmentelor primite de Ana și pe a treia linie sunt $N$ numere naturale $B_1$, $B_2$, ..., $B_N$ reprezentând lungimile fragmentelor primite de Bogdan.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `bete.out` va conține trei linii. Pe prima linie se va scrie numărul natural $L$ reprezentând lungimea inițială a bețelor, pe a doua linie se va scrie numărul natural $K$ reprezentând lungimea celui mai lung băț care se poate obține prin lipirea unui fragment aparținând Anei cu un fragment care aparține lui Bogdan, iar pe a treia linie se va scrie numărul natural $P$ reprezentând numărul bețelor de lungime maximă care se pot obține prin lipirea unui fragment aparținând Anei cu un fragment care aparține lui Bogdan.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq A_i \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq B_i \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq L \leq 20 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 20 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq P \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Odată lipite două fragmente, acestea nu se pot dezlipi.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a valorii L se acordă 30% din punctaj, pentru determinarea corectă a valorii K se acordă 30% din punctaj, iar pentru determinarea corectă a valorii P se acordă 40% din punctaj.

After reviewing the results and the code, I've identified that the bug lies in the calculation of the `originalLength`. Instead of taking the minimum fragments from both Ana and Bogdan, I should have paired each fragment from Ana with its corresponding fragment from Bogdan to find the original length of a stick.

To fix this, I'll adjust the logic to correctly determine the `originalLength` by adding pairs of fragments from Ana and Bogdan (since each stick was broken once, the two fragments from the same stick should add up to the original stick's length).

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("bete.in");
    ofstream out("bete.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    
    vector<int> A(N);
    vector<int> B(N);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> A[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> B[i];
    }

    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    sort(B.begin(), B.end());

    // Calculate the original length (L) by finding the maximum of sum of pairs.
    int originalLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        originalLength = max(originalLength, A[i] + B[N - 1 - i]);
    }

    // Calculate the maximum length (K) by finding the maximum of sums.
    int maxLength = 0, maxCount = 0;
    for (int ai = 0, bi = N - 1; ai < N; ++ai) {
        while (bi >= 0 && A[ai] + B[bi] > maxLength) {
            maxLength = A[ai] + B[bi];
            maxCount = 1;
            --bi;
        }
        while (bi >= 0 && A[ai] + B[bi] == maxLength) {
            ++maxCount;
            --bi;
        }
    }

    out << originalLength << '\n' << maxLength << '\n' << maxCount << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code now correctly calculates the original stick length by considering each pair (A[i], B[N - 1 - i]) and takes the maximum of these sums. It also finds the maximum length and the number of such maximum lengths that can be obtained by pairing Ana's and Bogdan's stick fragments. The use of `vector` also ensures that dynamic memory management is handled automatically.

Upon evaluating the differences, it seems that the program incorrectly calculates the maximum combined length (K) and the number of max-length sticks (P). The current algorithm fails to consider all possible combinations of sticks Ana and Bogdan have. To fix this, we should iterate through all possible combinations to find those matches.

Let's correct the logic for calculating the maximum length (K) and the number of max-length sticks (P). For this, we'll iterate through both sorted lists from the beginning and find the pairings that add up to the maximum possible combination.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("bete.in");
    ofstream out("bete.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    
    vector<int> A(N);
    vector<int> B(N);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> A[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> B[i];
    }

    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    sort(B.begin(), B.end());

    // Calculate the original length (L)
    int originalLength = A[0] + B[0];

    // Calculate the maximum length (K) and number of max-length sticks (P)
    int maxLength = 0, maxCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            int currentLength = A[i] + B[j];
            if (currentLength > maxLength) {
                maxLength = currentLength;
                maxCount = 1;
            } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {
                maxCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    out << originalLength << '\n' << maxLength << '\n' << maxCount << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution iterates through all combinations of stick fragments from Ana and Bogdan and updates the values of `maxLength` and `maxCount` accordingly. It now correctly calculates both the original stick length and the maximum possible stick length after pairing, including the count of the maximum length sticks.

The error in the previous submissions was in the calculation of the original stick length (L). The original stick length should be the sum of the corresponding fragments from Ana and Bogdan for each stick. Since the sticks were broken into two parts and distributed to Ana and Bogdan, the original length for each stick would be the sum of the paired fragments.

To find the original stick length, we don't need to find a maximum or do any sorting. We can pair up the pieces with the same index from Ana's and Bogdan's lists because each index corresponds to fragments of the same original stick.

For the maximum combined length (K) and the number of max-length sticks (P), we need a more comprehensive search through all combinations to find the longest stick that can be made and how many of them there are.

Here is the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("bete.in");
    ofstream out("bete.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    vector<int> A(N);
    vector<int> B(N);

    int originalLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> A[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> B[i];
        originalLength = max(originalLength, A[i] + B[i]); // Calculate the original stick length
    }

    // Sort both lists to use two-pointer technique for calculating K and P
    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    sort(B.begin(), B.end(), greater<int>());

    int maxLength = 0, maxCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // Ensure we check for maximum combined length with each of Ana's sticks
        while (j < N && A[i] + B[j] >= maxLength) {
            if (A[i] + B[j] > maxLength) {
                maxLength = A[i] + B[j];
                maxCount = 1;
            } else {
                maxCount++;
            }
            j++;
        }
    }

    out << originalLength << '\n' << maxLength << '\n' << maxCount << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads the lengths of the fragments, calculates the original length by pairing each of Ana's fragments with Bogdan's corresponding fragments, sorts the lists, and then uses a two-pointer approach to find the maximum possible stick length after pairing and the count of such sticks. The sorting of the second list is done in descending order to match each of Ana's sticks with the longest possible of Bogdan's sticks until a new maximum length is found.

The bug in the previous solution was again in the calculation of the original stick length (L). The original length should be the sum of the lengths of the two fragments that came from the same original stick. Since we do not know which fragments are paired together, we can't directly sum the elements of A and B at the same index after sorting.

The correct approach is not to sort the lists before calculating the original length. Instead, we should find the maximum sum of each corresponding pair of A[i] and B[i] before sorting. Only after calculating the original length should we sort the arrays to find the maximum length stick that can be made (K) and the number of such sticks (P).

Let's fix the solution using the correct approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("bete.in");
    ofstream out("bete.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    vector<int> A(N), B(N);
    
    // Reading the lengths of the fragments
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> A[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> B[i];
    }

    // Calculate the original lengths (L) before sorting
    int originalLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        originalLength = max(originalLength, A[i] + B[i]);
    }

    // Sort the lengths to find the maximum possible combined length (K)
    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    sort(B.begin(), B.end());

    int maxLength = 0, maxCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            int combinedLength = A[i] + B[j];
            if (combinedLength > maxLength) {
                maxLength = combinedLength;
                maxCount = 1;
            } else if (combinedLength == maxLength) {
                maxCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    out << originalLength << '\n' << maxLength << '\n' << maxCount << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution now correctly calculates the original length (L) before sorting. It then sorts the arrays to find all possible combinations for K and P, ensuring that the maximum combined length (K) and the number of such sticks (P) are accurately determined. The original length (L) is calculated by finding the maximum sum of each pair of corresponding elements from arrays A and B.

Upon examining the expected and found output, it's clear that the calculation of the original stick length (L) is still incorrect. The original stick length should be the sum of the two fragments that came from the same stick. This means for each index i, we should take A[i] + B[i] as a potential original stick length and take the maximum of these as the final original stick length.

The calculation of the maximum combined length (K) and the number of max-length sticks (P) also seems incorrect because it does not check all possible combinations correctly.

Let's correct both issues in the following solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("bete.in");
    ofstream out("bete.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    vector<int> A(N), B(N);

    // Reading the lengths of the fragments
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> A[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> B[i];
    }

    // Calculate the original lengths (L)
    int originalLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        originalLength = max(originalLength, A[i] + B[i]);
    }

    // Calculate the maximum length (K) and number of max-length sticks (P)
    int maxLength = 0, maxCount = 0;
    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    sort(B.begin(), B.end(), greater<int>()); // Sort B in descending order to maximize the length
    
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        while (j < N && A[i] + B[j] >= maxLength) {
            int combinedLength = A[i] + B[j];
            if (combinedLength > maxLength) {
                maxLength = combinedLength;
                maxCount = 1;
            } else if (combinedLength == maxLength) {
                maxCount++;
            }
            j++;
        }
    }

    out << originalLength << '\n' << maxLength << '\n' << maxCount << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This updated solution calculates the maximum original stick length (L) correctly by considering the sum of each corresponding pair before sorting. It then sorts array A in ascending order and B in descending order to efficiently find the maximum combined length (K) and the number of maximum length sticks (P) that can be made by pairing a fragment from Ana with a fragment from Bogdan. The while loop in the inner iteration is used to skip through fragments from Bogdan's array that have already been considered for a shorter stick from Ana's array, thus avoiding overcounting.

After reviewing the code and expected output, I have identified the issues in the previous attempts. The main mistake was how the original length (L) was being calculated. I incorrectly calculated L as the maximum sum of the pairs of fragments from the sorted arrays A and B. The original length L should be the total length of any stick before being broken into fragments, which means the sum of a fragment from A and a fragment from B that originally formed one whole stick.

To fix this, we need to find the pair of fragments with the largest sum, which would represent the length of the longest original stick. This should be done before sorting the fragments, as sorting would break the original pairings.

Also, the logic for determining the longest possible combined stick (K) and the count of such sticks (P) needs to be revisited to correctly go through all pairs of fragments. The previous implementation did not accurately check all combinations and had an incorrect while loop condition.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("bete.in");
    ofstream out("bete.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    vector<int> A(N), B(N);

    // Read the lengths of the fragments from Ana and Bogdan
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> A[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> B[i];
    }

    // Calculate the original length (L) by finding the largest sum of pairs
    int originalLength = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        originalLength = max(originalLength, A[i] + B[i]);
    }

    // Sort the fragment lengths from Ana and Bogdan
    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    sort(B.begin(), B.end());

    // Identify the maximum combined length (K) and the number of such sticks (P)
    int maxLength = 0, maxCount = 0;
    for (int ai = 0; ai < N; ++ai) {
        for (int bi = 0; bi < N; ++bi) {
            int combinedLength = A[ai] + B[bi];
            if (combinedLength > maxLength) {
                maxLength = combinedLength;
                maxCount = 1;
            } else if (combinedLength == maxLength) {
                // If the combined length equals the known maximum, increase the count
                maxCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    out << originalLength << '\n' << maxLength << '\n' << maxCount << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should now accurately calculate the original stick length (L) by checking the sum of each pair of fragments from Ana and Bogdan before sorting. It also correctly calculates the maximum combined stick length (K) and the count of such sticks (P) by considering all possible pairings of the sorted fragments.
