Definim un număr ***liber de pătrate*** ca fiind un număr natural care nu are ca divizor niciun pătrat perfect mai mare ca $1$. Prin convenție, $1$ este considerat *liber de pătrate*.

Așadar, șirul numerelor *libere de pătrate* este: $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, \dots$

Se consideră un șir de $N$ numere naturale $X_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, unde $N$ este un număr natural.

Definim o ***bisecvență*** ca un subșir nevid obținut prin eliminarea dintr-o secvență a unui număr care nu este la începutul sau la sfârșitul secvenței.

# Cerințe
1) Să se determine câte numere *libere de pătrate* conține șirul dat.
2) Să se determine cea mai lungă *bisecvență* din șir formată din numere *libere de pătrate*, obținută prin eliminarea unui număr care **nu** este *liber de pătrate*.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `oneout.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$, reprezentând cerința, pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$ iar pe a treia linie $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, în fișierul de ieșire `oneout.out` se va scrie numărul de numere *libere de pătrate* din șir.

Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$:
- Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `oneout.out` se vor scrie două numere $L$ și $K$ despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $L$ reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *bisecvențe* cu proprietățile cerute, iar $K$ reprezintă numărul de *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă existente în șir.
- Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor scrie indicii de început și de sfârșit ai fiecărei *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă găsite, în ordinea crescătoare a indicelui de start, despărțite printr-un spațiu.
- Dacă șirul nu conține nicio *bisecvență* cu proprietățile cerute, în fișierul de ieșire se va scrie `-1`.

# Restricții și precizări
- $3 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $2 \leq X_i \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Lungimea unei *bisecvențe* reprezintă numărul de numere din aceasta.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 37 de puncte $C = 1$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 24 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 25$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 63 de puncte $C = 2$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 23 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 101$.

This C++ solution defines a helper function `isSquareFree` which checks if a number is free from square divisors. The `main` function reads the input, processes according to the value of `C`, and writes the output. For `C = 1`, it counts the number of square-free numbers in the sequence. For `C = 2`, it finds the longest bisequence of square-free numbers and provides the details as described in the problem statement. It uses file streams to read from `oneout.in` and write to `oneout.out`.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, I have identified the issue with the logic implemented to determine bisequences. The problem lies in the strict condition that does not account for the possibility of square-free numbers at the beginning and end of the sequence. Additionally, the code does not handle the case in which the non-square-free number is on the edges of the sequence.

The definition of a bisequence requires eliminating a non-square-free number that is not at the start or end of the sequence. However, the sequence can start or end with a non-square-free number, and the longest bisequence can still include the square-free numbers next to those edges.

Let's fix the logic by tracking the start of a square-free subsequence and the end of it while ensuring that at least one non-square-free number is found in between.

Here is the corrected and rewritten solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

bool isSquareFree(int number) {
    for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= number; ++factor) {
        if (number % (factor * factor) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("oneout.in");
    ofstream fout("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;
    vector<int> sequence(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int countSquareFree = 0;
        for (int num : sequence) {
            if (isSquareFree(num)) {
                countSquareFree++;
            }
        }
        fout << countSquareFree;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        vector<pair<int, int>> maxBisequences;
        int start = 0, nonSquareFreeSeen = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (isSquareFree(sequence[i])) {
                if (nonSquareFreeSeen > 0) {
                    int length = i - start;
                    if (length > maxLength) {
                        maxLength = length;
                        maxBisequences = {{start + 1, i}};
                    } else if (length == maxLength) {
                        maxBisequences.push_back({start + 1, i});
                    }
                }
            } else {
                if (nonSquareFreeSeen == 0) { // First non-square-free number sets the start of the sequence.
                    start = i;
                }
                nonSquareFreeSeen++;
            }
            // Reset if we've reached a new potential start of a bisequence.
            if (nonSquareFreeSeen > 1) {
                nonSquareFreeSeen = 0;
            }
        }

        if (maxLength > 0) {
            fout << maxLength << ' ' << maxBisequences.size() << '\n';
            for (const auto &biseq : maxBisequences) {
                fout << biseq.first << ' ' << biseq.second << '\n';
            }
        } else {
            fout << -1;
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This updated solution should now properly identify the longest bisequences according to the problem definition. It uses a sliding window approach, moving the start position (`start`) of a bisequence forward whenever a non-square-free number is encountered and keeping track of whether at least one such number has been seen (`nonSquareFreeSeen`). The output conditions are the same as earlier.

Upon reviewing the previous submission and the expected output, I realize that there's a misunderstanding in the algorithm for computing the longest bisequence for the case `C = 2`. The logic was not entirely correct for handling the cases where the non-square-free number is at the beginning or the end of a bisequence. Moreover, it did not handle the case properly when the non-square-free numbers are in the middle of the sequence.

Let's redefine the correct approach to solve the problem:
- We need to find the longest subsequence of square-free numbers, which is interrupted by single non-square-free numbers.
- We will scan the sequence and track the beginning and end of continuous square-free subsequences. When we encounter a non-square-free number, we'll check if it's the only one between two square-free subsequences and potentially update our maximum bisequence length.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

bool isSquareFree(int number) {
    for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= number; ++factor) {
        if (number % (factor * factor) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;
    vector<int> sequence(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int countSquareFree = 0;
        for (int num : sequence) {
            if (isSquareFree(num)) {
                countSquareFree++;
            }
        }
        fout << countSquareFree;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        vector<pair<int, int>> maxBisequences;
        int currentStart = -1;
        int lastNonSquareFree = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (isSquareFree(sequence[i])) {
                if (currentStart < 0) {
                    currentStart = i; // Start new square-free subsequence
                }
            } else {
                if (currentStart >= 0 && lastNonSquareFree < currentStart) {
                    // We found a non-square-free number that could act as a separator between bisequences
                    lastNonSquareFree = i;
                } else {
                    // End of the potential bisequence, examine its length
                    int length = i - currentStart - 1; // currentStart to lastNonSquareFree - 1
                    if (length > maxLength) {
                        maxLength = length;
                        maxBisequences.clear();
                        maxBisequences.push_back(make_pair(currentStart + 1, lastNonSquareFree));
                    } else if (length == maxLength) {
                        maxBisequences.push_back(make_pair(currentStart + 1, lastNonSquareFree));
                    }
                    currentStart = -1; // Reset for the next square-free subsequence
                }
            }
        }

        // Handle case where the sequence ends with a square-free number 
        // and the last non-square-free number is a valid separator.
        if (currentStart >= 0 && lastNonSquareFree > currentStart) {
            int length = N - currentStart - 1;
            if (length > maxLength) {
                maxLength = length;
                maxBisequences.clear();

This solution properly handles bisequences and updates the maximum length considering the correct conditions. It should now produce the expected output for the example given and also handle other cases according to the problem requirements.

The differences between the expected and found result indicate that the algorithm incorrectly identifies the start and end indices of the longest bisequence. The issue stems from the logic that attempts to track the beginning of the square-free subsequence (`currentStart`) and the last non-square-free number (`lastNonSquareFree`).

In the expected output, the longest bisequence is 3 numbers long, starting from index 1 to index 4. This means it includes the numbers 10, 2, and 12, with the number 12 being the non-square-free number that gets removed. The previous code incorrectly identified the bisequence as starting from index 1 to index 2.

Let's fix the logic by ensuring that we correctly track the longest bisequence, including the non-square-free number that is skipped.

Here is the rewritten solution with the necessary fix:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

bool isSquareFree(int number) {
    for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= number; ++factor) {
        if (number % (factor * factor) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("oneout.in");
    ofstream fout("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;
    vector<int> sequence(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int countSquareFree = 0;
        for (int num : sequence) {
            if (isSquareFree(num)) {
                countSquareFree++;
            }
        }
        fout << countSquareFree;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        // We keep the positions of the start of square-free subsequences,
        // the last non-square-free number, and the longest bisequence found.
        int maxStart = -1, maxEnd = -1;
        int currentStart = -1, lastNonSquareFree = -2;
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        sequence.push_back(0); // Sentinel value to handle the last subsequence.
        for (int i = 0; i < N + 1; ++i) {
            if (isSquareFree(sequence[i])) {
                if (currentStart == -1) currentStart = i;
            } else {
                if (currentStart != -1 && i - lastNonSquareFree > 1) {
                    // A valid bisequence ends before the current non-square-free number.
                    int currentLength = i - currentStart - 1;
                    if (currentLength > maxLength) {
                        maxLength = currentLength;
                        maxStart = currentStart;
                        maxEnd = i - 1;
                    }
                }
                lastNonSquareFree = i;
                currentStart = -1;
            }
        }
        
        if (maxLength == 0) {
            fout << -1;
        } else {
            fout << maxLength << " 1\n";
            fout << maxStart + 1 << ' ' << maxEnd; // Indices are 1-based.
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we take into account that the bisequence should include square-free numbers from the current start until the index before the last non-square-free number. We also consider that the longest bisequence may end at the last index of the array, which is why we've added a sentinel value at the end of the `sequence` to handle the edge case. This solution should now produce the expected output.

The expected output indicates that the longest bisequence of square-free numbers is of length 3, and it starts at index 1 and ends at index 4. In the given input sequence, "10 2 12 7 8 15", number 12 is the non-square-free number that is meant to be eliminated as part of the bisequence, leaving us with "10 2 7" as the longest bisequence.

The previous solution did not consider that we could have a situation where the non-square-free number to be removed is at the end of the longest bisequence. The logic needs to be revised to account for this situation.

Here is the corrected solution:

#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to determine if a number is square-free.
bool isSquareFree(int number) {
    for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= number; factor++) {
        if (number % (factor * factor) == 0) {
            return false; // Not square-free.
        }
    }
    return true; // Square-free.
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("oneout.in");
    ofstream fout("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;
    vector<int> sequence(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int countSquareFree = count_if(sequence.begin(), sequence.end(), isSquareFree);
        fout << countSquareFree;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int maxLen = 0, maxCount = 0;
        vector<pair<int, int>> longestBisequences;
        int currentLen = 0, currentStart = 0;
        int nonSquareCount = 0, lastNonSquareIndex = -1;

        // Iterate over the sequence to find the longest bisequence.
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (isSquareFree(sequence[i])) {
                currentLen++; // Extend current square-free subsequence.
            } else {
                if (nonSquareCount == 0) {
                    // First non-square-free number, potentially part of a bisequence.
                    nonSquareCount++;
                    lastNonSquareIndex = i;
                } else {
                    // Second non-square-free number, previous subsequence is terminated.
                    nonSquareCount = 1; // Reset for next potential bisequence.
                    currentStart = lastNonSquareIndex + 1; // Start from the last non-square-free.
                    lastNonSquareIndex = i;
                    currentLen = i - currentStart; // Reset current length.
                }
            }

            // Check if we found a new longest bisequence.
            if (nonSquareCount == 1 && currentLen > maxLen) {
                maxLen = currentLen;
                longestBisequences.clear();
                longestBisequences.emplace_back(currentStart + 1, lastNonSquareIndex); // 1-based indexing.
            }
        }

        // Handle the case where the last number is square-free and the non-square-free number
        // before it is part of the longest bisequence.
        if (nonSquareCount == 1 && N - currentStart > maxLen) {
            maxLen = N - currentStart;
            longestBisequences.clear();
            longestBisequences.emplace_back(currentStart + 1, N); // 1-based indexing.
        }

        // Output the results.
        if (!longestBisequences.empty()) {
            fout << maxLen << " " << longestBisequences.size() << '\n';
            for (auto &biseq : longestBisequences) {
                fout << biseq.first << " " << biseq.second << '\n';
            }
        } else {
            fout << -1 << '\n'; // No valid bisequence found.
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly identify the longest bisequences, including the case where the non-square-free number is at the end of the longest bisequence. It uses a single pass over the sequence to find all valid bisequences and then outputs the details of the longest ones found.

The expected output indicates that the longest bisequence of square-free numbers is of length 3, and it starts at index 1 and ends at index 4. In the given input sequence, "10 2 12 7 8 15", number 12 is a non-square-free number that gets removed as part of the bisequence, leaving us with "10 2 7" as the longest bisequence that includes square-free numbers only.

The previous solution did not correctly find the longest bisequence that includes square-free numbers with one non-square-free number in between that is removed.

Let us now fix the solution considering the following points:
- The longest bisequence can start at the beginning of the sequence or directly after a non-square-free number.
- The longest bisequence can end at the end of the sequence or directly before a non-square-free number.
- The non-square-free number that can be removed to form the bisequence can be at the start, in the middle, or at the end of the bisequence.

Let's write the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

bool isSquareFree(int number) {
    if (number < 4) return true;
    for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= number; factor++) {
        if (number % (factor * factor) == 0) {
            return false; // Not square-free.
        }
    }
    return true; // Square-free.
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("oneout.in");
    ofstream fout("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;
    vector<int> numbers(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> numbers[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int squareFreeCount = 0;
        for (int number : numbers) {
            if (isSquareFree(number)) {
                ++squareFreeCount;
            }
        }
        fout << squareFreeCount;
    } else {
        vector<int> squareFreeIdx;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (isSquareFree(numbers[i])) {
                squareFreeIdx.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        int longestBisequenceLen = 0;
        int longestBisequenceStart = -1;
        int currentStart = 0;

        for (size_t i = 1; i < squareFreeIdx.size(); ++i) {
            if (squareFreeIdx[i] - squareFreeIdx[i - 1] > 1) { // Found a non-square-free number
                int currentLen = squareFreeIdx[i - 1] - currentStart + 1;
                if (currentLen > longestBisequenceLen) {
                    longestBisequenceLen = currentLen;
                    longestBisequenceStart = currentStart;
                }
                currentStart = squareFreeIdx[i];
            }
        }

        // Check the last bisequence if it ends at the end of the sequence
        if (!squareFreeIdx.empty() && N - currentStart > longestBisequenceLen) {
            longestBisequenceLen = N - currentStart;
            longestBisequenceStart = currentStart;
        }

        if (longestBisequenceLen > 0) {
            fout << longestBisequenceLen << " 1\n" << (longestBisequenceStart + 1) << " " << (longestBisequenceStart + longestBisequenceLen);
        } else {
            fout << -1;
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we use a vector `squareFreeIdx` to store the indices of the square-free numbers. Then, we iterate over this vector to identify the longest bisequence. When a gap larger than 1 is found in the indices (indicating a non-square-free number), we check if the length of the current bisequence is the longest so far and update the result accordingly. We also check the last bisequence in case it ends at the end of the sequence. This solution should now give the correct longest bisequence according to the problem statement.

The differences in the output indicate that there is an error in the logic for finding the longest bisequence, specifically in how it handles non-square-free numbers within the sequence. Let's analyze the requirements and the algorithm to implement the correct logic.

The problem statement defines a bisequence as a subsequence of square-free numbers that can be obtained by removing a single non-square-free number that is not at the beginning or end of the sequence. Therefore:

1. A bisequence can start at the very beginning of the sequence or immediately after a non-square-free number.
2. A bisequence can end at the very end of the sequence or immediately before a non-square-free number.
3. Non-square-free numbers that can be removed to form a bisequence can be surrounded by square-free numbers.

Here is the revised solution that correctly implements the logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

bool isSquareFree(int number) {
    for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= number; ++factor) {
        if (number % (factor * factor) == 0)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("oneout.in");
    ofstream fout("oneout.out");
    
    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;
    vector<int> sequence(N);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }
    
    if (C == 1) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : sequence) {
            if (isSquareFree(num)) ++count;
        }
        fout << count;
    } else { // C == 2
        int maxBisequenceLength = 0;
        int currentStart = 0; // Start of the current square-free sequence
        int lastNonSquare = -1; // The index of the last non-square-free number
        vector<pair<int, int>> maxBisequences;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (isSquareFree(sequence[i])) {
                if (i == N - 1 || !isSquareFree(sequence[i + 1])) {
                    // Check if the current sequence is longer than the maximum bisequence found so far
                    int currentLength = i - currentStart + 1;
                    if (isSquareFree(sequence[currentStart]) && isSquareFree(sequence[i])) {
                        currentLength--; // Exclude current number as only one non-square-free can be removed
                    }
                    if (currentLength > maxBisequenceLength) {
                        maxBisequenceLength = currentLength;
                        maxBisequences.clear();
                        maxBisequences.emplace_back(currentStart, i);
                    } else if (currentLength == maxBisequenceLength) {
                        maxBisequences.emplace_back(currentStart, i);
                    }
                    currentStart = i + 1; // Update currentStart for the next sequence
                }
            } else {
                if (lastNonSquare < currentStart - 1) {
                    // The non-square-free number is a potential separator between bisequences
                    lastNonSquare = i;
                } else {
                    // The non-square-free number is not a valid separator, reset the current sequence
                    currentStart = i + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Write the output
        if (maxBisequenceLength > 0) {
            fout << maxBisequenceLength << ' ' << maxBisequences.size() << '\n';
            for (const auto &biseq : maxBisequences) {
                fout << biseq.first + 1 << ' ' << biseq.second + 1 << '\n'; // Output is 1-indexed
            }
        } else {
            fout << -1 << '\n'; // No bisequence found
        }
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly identify the longest bisequence that includes square-free numbers, with one non-square-free number in between that is removed. The algorithm uses a single pass over the sequence to find all valid bisequences by considering each non-square-free number as a potential separator and updates the longest bisequences accordingly. The output is then provided based on these calculations.
