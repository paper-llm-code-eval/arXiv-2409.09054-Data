La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here is a C++ solution for the programming challenge:

```cpp

struct Contestant {
    int county;
    int id;
};

bool operator<(const Contestant& a, const Contestant& b) {

        fin >> J >> E;
        contestants[J].push_back(E);
        county_count[J]++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= 50; ++i) {
        sort(contestants[i].begin(), contestants[i].end());
    }

    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        if (!contestants[i].empty()) {
            pq.push({i, 0});
        }
    }

    int NJ = 0;
    for (int count : county_count) {
        if (count > 0) NJ++;
    }

    fout << NJ << '\n';
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        if (county_count[i] > 0) {
            fout << county_count[i] << ' ';
        }
    }
    fout << '\n';

    int last_county = -1;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [current_county, idx] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        if (current_county != last_county) {
            fout << current_county << ' ' << contestants[current_county][idx] << '\n';
            last_county = current_county;

            idx++;
            if (idx < contestants[current_county].size()) {
                pq.push({current_county, idx});
            }
        } else {
            pq.push({current_county, idx});
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads the input data from `concurs.in`, processes the contestants, sorts them within their respective counties, counts the number of participants from each county, writes the number of counties and the number of participants per county to `concurs.out`, and then generates the required list following the stated conditions. It does not use `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf` for file I/O operations.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that a program was forcefully terminated, often due to running out of memory or being killed by the operating system (for example, when using Linux if the `kill -9` command is issued or the system's Out-Of-Memory killer is triggered). However, since the standard output and standard error are empty, it does not give us detailed insight into the cause of the error in this particular case.

Given the constraints of the problem (with a maximum of 500 contestants and 50 counties), memory usage should not be a concern. However, there could be an issue with the logic of the program that's causing it to enter an infinite loop or behave unexpectedly.

One possible issue I spotted in the provided code is that the priority queue might be getting into a situation where it continuously tries to push the same county back into the queue without making progress, which can happen if the `last_county` check prevents any county from being processed.

Here's a revised version of the solution that ensures we always progress by alternately selecting a different county while preserving the sorted order of contestants:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTY = 50;

struct Contestant {
    int county;
    int id;
};

// Comparator for sorting contestants within the same county.
bool comp(const int& a, const int& b) {
    return a < b;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P, J, E;
    fin >> P;
    vector<vector<int>> contestants(MAX_COUNTY + 1);
    vector<int> county_count(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> J >> E;
        contestants[J].push_back(E);
        county_count[J]++;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        sort(contestants[i].begin(), contestants[i].end(), comp);
    }

    int NJ = 0;
    for (int count : county_count) {
        if (count > 0) NJ++;
    }

    fout << NJ << '\n';
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (county_count[i] > 0) {
            fout << county_count[i] << ' ';
        }
    }
    fout << '\n';

    vector<int> idx(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);
    int last_county = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= MAX_COUNTY; ++j) {
            if (!contestants[j].empty() && idx[j] < contestants[j].size() && j != last_county) {
                fout << j << ' ' << contestants[j][idx[j]] << '\n';
                last_county = j;
                idx[j]++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly alternate between counties and increment the index within each county to ensure we always make progress and eventually output all contestants while adhering to the constraints. It also makes sure to open and close the files properly and does not use `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf`.

The error message indicates that the `sort` function was not declared in the scope. This is because we need to include the `<algorithm>` header to use the `sort` function in C++. Let's include the necessary header and rewrite the entire solution with the fix:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTY = 50;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P, J, E;
    fin >> P;
    vector<vector<int>> contestants(MAX_COUNTY + 1);
    vector<int> county_count(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> J >> E;
        contestants[J].push_back(E);
        county_count[J]++;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        sort(contestants[i].begin(), contestants[i].end());
    }

    int NJ = 0;
    for (int count : county_count) {
        if (count > 0) NJ++;
    }

    fout << NJ << '\n';
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (county_count[i] > 0) {
            fout << county_count[i] << ' ';
        }
    }
    fout << '\n';

    vector<int> idx(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);
    int last_county = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= MAX_COUNTY; ++j) {
            if (!contestants[j].empty() && idx[j] < contestants[j].size() && j != last_county) {
                fout << j << ' ' << contestants[j][idx[j]] << '\n';
                last_county = j;
                idx[j]++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

With the inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header, the program should now compile successfully and execute the sorting process correctly.

The issue with the previous implementation is that it didn't ensure that consecutive contestants are from different counties. The loop simply iterated through the counties and didn't check if the previous contestant was from a different county, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, we need to implement a different approach that ensures this condition is met. A common strategy is to use a round-robin approach to cycle through the counties, picking the next available contestant from a different county each time.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTY = 50;

// Contestant struct for holding county and ID information.
struct Contestant {
    int county;
    int id;
    Contestant(int c, int i) : county(c), id(i) {}
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P, J, E;
    fin >> P;
    vector<vector<int>> contestants(MAX_COUNTY + 1);
    vector<int> county_count(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> J >> E;
        contestants[J].push_back(E);
        county_count[J]++;
    }

    // Sort contestants within each county.
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        sort(contestants[i].begin(), contestants[i].end());
    }

    int NJ = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (county_count[i] > 0) NJ++;
    }

    fout << NJ << '\n';
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (county_count[i] > 0) {
            fout << county_count[i] << ' ';
        }
    }
    fout << '\n';

    // Initialize a queue to store the next available contestant from each county.
    queue<Contestant> q;
    int last_county = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (!contestants[i].empty()) {
            q.push(Contestant(i, contestants[i][0]));
            contestants[i].erase(contestants[i].begin()); // Remove the contestant from the county list.
        }
    }

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Contestant current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Ensure that the current contestant is not from the same county as the last one.
        if (current.county != last_county) {
            fout << current.county << ' ' << current.id << '\n';
            last_county = current.county;

            // If there are more contestants in the current county, add the next one to the queue.
            if (!contestants[current.county].empty()) {
                q.push(Contestant(current.county, contestants[current.county][0]));
                contestants[current.county].erase(contestants[current.county].begin());
            }
        } else {
            q.push(current); // Put the contestant back in the queue to try again later.
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The fixed solution still sorts the contestants within each county, counts the number of counties and participants per county, and writes these to `concurs.out`. Then, it initializes a queue and uses a round-robin approach to ensure that consecutive contestants are from different counties. It avoids consecutive contestants from the same county by re-queuing them until it's possible to select a contestant from a different county.

The exit code 137 indicates that the program was terminated, which could be due to an out-of-memory condition or the program being forcefully killed by the operating system. Given that the standard output and standard error are empty, there's no direct error message to indicate the issue. However, the program may be terminated by the operating system if it's running into an infinite loop and consuming too many system resources.

Upon reviewing the code, I see a potential for an infinite loop with the queue-based logic. If the program encounters a situation where the county at the front of the queue is the same as `last_county` and there are no other counties with contestants left, the program will keep pushing and popping the same contestant indefinitely.

To avoid this situation, we can implement a rotating index to ensure that we always move to a different county. This approach will eliminate the need for a queue and prevent the infinite loop.

Let's rewrite the solution with a rotating index:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTY = 50;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P, J, E;
    fin >> P;
    vector<vector<int>> contestants(MAX_COUNTY + 1);
    vector<int> county_count(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);
    vector<int> indices(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> J >> E;
        contestants[J].push_back(E);
        county_count[J]++;
    }

    // Sort contestants within each county
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        sort(contestants[i].begin(), contestants[i].end());
    }

    // Count the number of counties with contestants
    int NJ = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (county_count[i] > 0) NJ++;
    }

    fout << NJ << '\n';
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (county_count[i] > 0) {
            fout << county_count[i] << ' ';
        }
    }
    fout << '\n';

    int last_county = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= MAX_COUNTY; ++j) {
            if (indices[j] < contestants[j].size() && j != last_county) {
                fout << j << ' ' << contestants[j][indices[j]] << '\n';
                last_county = j;
                indices[j]++;
                i++;
                break; // Break after finding a contestant from a different county
            }
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, instead of using a queue, we keep track of the current index for each county in the `indices` vector. We only increment the index of the county after it has been processed, which eliminates the possibility of an infinite loop. The inner loop ensures that we always pick a contestant from a different county than the last one processed.

Evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, the issue seems to be with the order in which contestants from different counties are being outputted. The found output does not strictly alternate between counties as demanded by the problem statement. The provided implementation does not guarantee that each subsequent contestant will be from a different county than the previous one.

To ensure that contestants are listed such that no two consecutive contestants are from the same county, we need to implement a method that always picks the next available contestant from a different county, and we also need to make sure that all contestants from a county are listed in ascending order.

We can use a round-robin scheduler approach to achieve this. Instead of using an inner loop, we maintain a current position index for each county and rotate through the counties, selecting the next contestant from a county different from the last one chosen. If a county is out of contestants, we skip it and move on to the next county.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTY = 50;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");

    int P, J, E;
    fin >> P;
    vector<vector<int>> contestants(MAX_COUNTY + 1);
    vector<int> county_count(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);
    set<int> available_counties;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> J >> E;
        contestants[J].push_back(E);
        county_count[J]++;
        available_counties.insert(J);
    }

    // Sort contestants within each county
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        sort(contestants[i].begin(), contestants[i].end());
    }

    // Count the number of counties with contestants
    fout << available_counties.size() << '\n';
    for (int county : available_counties) {
        fout << county_count[county] << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    int last_county = 0;
    while (!available_counties.empty()) {
        bool found = false;
        for (auto it = available_counties.begin(); it != available_counties.end(); ++it) {
            int county = *it;
            if (county != last_county) {
                fout << county << ' ' << contestants[county].front() << '\n';
                last_county = county;
                contestants[county].erase(contestants[county].begin());
                if (contestants[county].empty()) {
                    available_counties.erase(it);
                }

        // If we couldn't find a different county, we reset the last_county to 0 and try again.

In this solution, we use a set `available_counties` to keep track of counties that still have contestants available. We iterate over the set to select the next contestant, ensuring that we don't pick from the same county consecutively. Once a contestant has been selected, we remove them from the county's list. If the list becomes empty, we remove the county from the set. We continue this process until no counties are left. This guarantees that we alternate between different counties and adhere to the sorted order within each county.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results lies in the order of the counties from which participants are chosen. The expected result alternates counties more effectively, ensuring that no two consecutive participants are from the same county, as long as it's possible to do so.

To fix the solution, I will implement an approach that uses a queue for each county to store its participants. Then, I will use a list to track the order in which to visit the counties. If a county has no more participants, it will be removed from the list. This will ensure that we alternate between counties as long as possible.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <list>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTY = 50;

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;
};

bool comp(const Participant& a, const Participant& b) {
    if (a.county == b.county) return a.id < b.id;
    return a.county < b.county;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;
    vector<Participant> participants(P);

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> participants[i].county >> participants[i].id;
    }

    // Sort participants by county and ID.
    sort(participants.begin(), participants.end(), comp);

    // Create and initialize county queues
    vector<deque<int>> countyQueues(MAX_COUNTY + 1);
    vector<int> countySizes(MAX_COUNTY + 1, 0);
    for (const auto& p : participants) {
        countyQueues[p.county].push_back(p.id);
        countySizes[p.county]++;
    }

    // Output the number of counties with participants
    int numCounties = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (!countyQueues[i].empty()) numCounties++;
    }
    fout << numCounties << '\n';

    // Output the number of participants from each county
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (countySizes[i] > 0) {
            fout << countySizes[i] << ' ';
        }
    }
    fout << '\n';

    // List to iterate through counties in a round-robin fashion
    list<int> countyOrder;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTY; ++i) {
        if (!countyQueues[i].empty()) {
            countyOrder.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    int prevCounty = 0;
    auto it = countyOrder.begin();
    while (!countyOrder.empty()) {
        // Skip if the same as previous county and not the only one left
        if (*it == prevCounty && countyOrder.size() > 1) {
            ++it;
            if (it == countyOrder.end()) it = countyOrder.begin();
            continue;
        }
        fout << *it << ' ' << countyQueues[*it].front() << '\n';
        countyQueues[*it].pop_front();
        prevCounty = *it;
        if (countyQueues[*it].empty()) {
            it = countyOrder.erase(it); // Remove county if no more participants
        } else {
            ++it;
        }
        if (it == countyOrder.end() && !countyOrder.empty()) it = countyOrder.begin();
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we ensure the following:
1. Participants are sorted by county and ID.
2. We use a `list` to keep track of the counties in the order they should be visited.
3. We iterate through this list in a round-robin fashion, selecting the next available participant from a different county than the previous one.
4. If a county runs out of participants, it is removed from the list.

This should ensure that we adhere to the stipulated conditions, thereby matching the expected output.
