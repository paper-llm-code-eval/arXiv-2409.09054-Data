La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code constructs the required list by reading the identifiers from `concurs.in`, sorting the students within each county, and then interleaving the counties in the output file `concurs.out`. The solution avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, and `scanf`, as per the given instructions.

The issue with the previous implementation is that it does not ensure that consecutive students are from different counties. Instead, it simply prints all students from one county before moving to the next. This violates the second condition of the task.

To fix this issue, we can use a queue-like structure to process one student from each county at a time. Specifically, we can use a round-robin scheduling approach to pick one student from each county in turn, ensuring that no two consecutive students are from the same county.

Let's rewrite the solution with this approach in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int county;
    int id;
};

int main() {
    ifstream input("concurs.in");
    ofstream output("concurs.out");

    int P, county_id, student_id;
    input >> P;

    vector<queue<int>> counties(51);
    vector<bool> has_students(51, false);
    vector<int> county_order;
    int county_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        input >> county_id >> student_id;
        if (!has_students[county_id]) {
            has_students[county_id] = true;
            county_order.push_back(county_id);
            county_count++;
        }
        counties[county_id].push(input);
    }
    input.close();

    sort(county_order.begin(), county_order.end());

    output << county_count << '\n';
    for (int county : county_order) {
        output << counties[county].size() << ' ';
    }
    output << '\n';

    while (P > 0) {
        for (int county : county_order) {
            if (!counties[county].empty()) {
                output << county << ' ' << counties[county].front() << '\n';
                counties[county].pop();
                P--;
            }
        }
    }

    output.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a vector of queues to keep track of the students in each county. The queues store the IDs of the students, which allows us to easily access them in increasing order. The `county_order` vector is used to ensure we process counties in increasing order of their identifiers.

Each iteration over the `county_order` takes one student from each county and prints them to the output file. We continue this process until no students are left, thus fulfilling the requirement that students from the same county should be listed in increasing order of their IDs and ensuring that consecutive students are from different counties.

The compilation error is due to a typo in the code. Specifically, the line `counties[county_id].push(input);` attempts to push the entire input file stream into the queue instead of the read student ID. This is a clear mistake since a queue of integers cannot store an input stream object. We need to push the `student_id` variable instead.

Let's correct this mistake and rewrite the complete solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream input("concurs.in");
    ofstream output("concurs.out");

    int P, county_id, student_id;
    input >> P;

    vector<queue<int>> counties(51);
    vector<int> county_order;
    vector<bool> has_students(51, false);
    int county_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        input >> county_id >> student_id;
        if (!has_students[county_id]) {
            has_students[county_id] = true;
            county_order.push_back(county_id);
            county_count++;
        }
        counties[county_id].push(student_id);
    }
    input.close();

    sort(county_order.begin(), county_order.end());

    output << county_count << '\n';
    for (int county : county_order) {
        output << counties[county].size() << ' ';
    }
    output << '\n';

    while (P > 0) {
        for (int county : county_order) {
            if (!counties[county].empty()) {
                output << county << ' ' << counties[county].front() << '\n';
                counties[county].pop();
                P--;
            }
        }
    }

    output.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this updated solution, we corrected the typo by changing `counties[county_id].push(input);` to `counties[county_id].push(student_id);`, which ensures that the student ID is added to the appropriate queue. This should resolve the compilation error and create the desired output in the `concurs.out` file according to the task requirements.

The issue with the previous implementation is that it does not ensure students from each county are sorted by their IDs before being interleaved. The solution needs to ensure that within each county, students are sorted, and then it should interleave students from different counties respecting their sorted order.

Let's address this by sorting each county's students after reading all the input data and before writing to the output file. I will fix the code according to these requirements:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream input("concurs.in");
    ofstream output("concurs.out");

    int P, county_id, student_id;
    input >> P;

    vector<queue<int>> counties(51);
    vector<int> county_order;
    vector<int> county_sizes(51, 0);
    vector<pair<int, int>> students;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        input >> county_id >> student_id;
        students.emplace_back(county_id, student_id);
    }
    input.close();

    // Sort students first by county_id then by student_id
    sort(students.begin(), students.end());

    // Populate the counties' queues and determine county order
    for (auto &student : students) {
        int c_id = student.first;
        if (county_sizes[c_id] == 0) {
            county_order.push_back(c_id); // Add county to the order list once
        }
        counties[c_id].push(student.second);
        county_sizes[c_id]++;
    }

    output << county_order.size() << '\n';
    for (int county : county_order) {
        output << county_sizes[county] << ' ';
    }
    output << '\n';

    bool is_first_round = true;
    while (!students.empty()) {
        for (int i = 0; i < county_order.size(); ++i) {
            int c_id = county_order[i];
            if (!counties[c_id].empty()) {
                if (!is_first_round || (is_first_round && i == 0)) { // For the first county in the first round
                    output << c_id << ' ';
                } else {
                    output << '\n' << c_id << ' '; // For all other cases
                }
                output << counties[c_id].front();
                counties[c_id].pop();
                students.pop_back(); // Remove a student after processing
            }
        }
        is_first_round = false;
    }
    output << '\n'; // Add the final newline

    output.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this revised solution, we read all the student data into a vector of pairs, then sort this vector by county and student ID. We then populate each county's queue with the sorted student IDs, ensuring that students from the same county are processed in increasing order. We also keep track of county sizes for the second line of the output and maintain the order of counties found.

The output phase now consists of interleaving the counties while respecting the sorted order of students within each county. This should produce the correct interleaved output as expected by the problem statement.

The previous code still does not provide the correct output; it doesn't alternate between counties properly, and the last while loop has some logic issues leading to incorrect output formatting.

To rectify this problem, we will use a `priority_queue` for each county, and we will also keep track of which counties still have students to be processed. We will interleave students from different counties by continuously rotating through the counties that have students left.

Here is the corrected version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int id;
    int county;
};

// Comparator for priority queue that sorts by student ID in ascending order
auto cmp = [](const Student& left, const Student& right) { return left.id > right.id; };

int main() {
    ifstream input("concurs.in");
    ofstream output("concurs.out");

    int P, county_id, student_id;
    input >> P;

    // Priority queue for each county to sort students by their IDs
    vector<priority_queue<Student, vector<Student>, decltype(cmp)>> counties(51, priority_queue<Student, vector<Student>, decltype(cmp)>(cmp));
    set<int> active_counties;
    vector<int> county_sizes(51, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        input >> county_id >> student_id;
        counties[county_id].push({student_id, county_id});
        active_counties.insert(county_id);
        county_sizes[county_id]++;
    }
    input.close();

    output << active_counties.size() << '\n';
    for (int county : active_counties) {
        output << county_sizes[county] << ' ';
    }
    output << '\n';

    while (!active_counties.empty()) {
        vector<int> to_remove;
        for (int county : active_counties) {
            if (!counties[county].empty()) {
                auto student = counties[county].top();
                counties[county].pop();
                output << student.county << ' ' << student.id << '\n';
                if (counties[county].empty()) {
                    to_remove.push_back(county);
                }
            }
        }
        // Remove counties that have no more students
        for (int county : to_remove) {
            active_counties.erase(county);
        }
    }

    output.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution maintains a priority queue for each county to ensure students are processed in ascending order of their IDs. The `active_counties` set keeps track of which counties have students left. We loop over the `active_counties` set to interleave students from different counties, and after processing a student from a county, we check if the county's queue is empty to remove it from the set of active counties.

This adjustment should ensure that the output meets the problem's constraints and matches the expected output.

The problem with the previous solution was that it did not properly interleave participants from different counties. Instead, it would output all participants from one county before moving to the next, not ensuring that consecutive participants are from different counties.

To fix the solution, we need to implement a way to interleave participants from different counties while maintaining county order and participant order within each county. We will use a round-robin approach and track the next participant from each county to be printed. If a county runs out of participants, we exclude it from the round-robin cycle.

Below is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTIES = 50;
const int MAX_PARTICIPANTS = 1000;

ifstream input("concurs.in");
ofstream output("concurs.out");

vector<int> countyParticipants[MAX_COUNTIES + 1]; // To store participants for each county
vector<int> countyOrder; // To store the order of counties
int countySizes[MAX_COUNTIES + 1] = {0}; // To store the sizes of each county list of participants

void readInput(int &totalParticipants) {
    int county, participant;
    input >> totalParticipants;
    for (int i = 0; i < totalParticipants; ++i) {
        input >> county >> participant;
        countyParticipants[county].push_back(participant); // Add participant to the respective county
        if (countySizes[county] == 0) {
            countyOrder.push_back(county); // Add county to the order list if it's the first participant
        }
        countySizes[county]++;
    }
}

void writeOutput(int totalParticipants) {
    // Output the number of counties
    output << countyOrder.size() << '\n';

    // Sort the counties and their participants
    sort(countyOrder.begin(), countyOrder.end());
    for (int county : countyOrder) {
        sort(countyParticipants[county].begin(), countyParticipants[county].end());
        output << countySizes[county] << ' ';
    }
    output << '\n';

    vector<int> indexes(MAX_COUNTIES + 1, 0); // Track the current index for each county
    bool finished = false;
    
    // Interleave the participants from each county
    while (!finished) {
        finished = true;
        for (int county : countyOrder) {
            if (indexes[county] < countySizes[county]) {
                output << county << ' ' << countyParticipants[county][indexes[county]++] << '\n';
                finished = false;
            }
        }

int main() {

This solution reads the input file and stores participants for each county in a vector. It maintains the order of counties with participants and the size of each county's participant list. The list of participants for each county is sorted in ascending order.

When writing the output, we follow a round-robin approach by using an index array to keep track of the next participant to be output for each county. We loop through the counties in order and print the next participant, updating the index for that county. Once we have printed all participants for a county, we no longer increment the index for that county. The loop continues until all participants have been printed in the required interleaved format.

Upon reviewing the problem again, I've realized the solution requires not only alternating counties but also maintaining the order of students within each county. Given the constraints, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, but we must ensure that we pick the next available student from a different county than the previous one.

We can achieve this by using a queue to hold the order in which counties appear and dequeueing and enqueueing counties as we process their students. This will maintain the round-robin order while ensuring no two consecutive students are from the same county.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_COUNTIES = 50;

struct Student {
    int id;
    int county;
};

int main() {
    ifstream input("concurs.in");
    ofstream output("concurs.out");

    int P;
    input >> P;

    vector<Student> students(P);
    vector<int> county_sizes(MAX_COUNTIES + 1, 0);
    vector<bool> county_exists(MAX_COUNTIES + 1, false);
    vector<queue<int>> county_queues(MAX_COUNTIES + 1);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        input >> students[i].county >> students[i].id;
        county_sizes[students[i].county]++;
        county_exists[students[i].county] = true;
    }
    input.close();

    sort(students.begin(), students.end(), [](const Student& a, const Student& b) {
        return a.county == b.county ? a.id < b.id : a.county < b.county;
    });

    for (auto& student : students) {
        county_queues[student.county].push(student.id);
    }

    queue<int> county_order;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTIES; ++i) {
        if (county_exists[i]) {
            county_order.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    output << county_order.size() << '\n';
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_COUNTIES; ++i) {
        if (county_sizes[i] > 0) {
            output << county_sizes[i] << " ";
        }
    }
    output << '\n';

    int prev_county = -1; // To keep track of previously written county

    while (!county_order.empty()) {
        int cur_county = county_order.front();
        county_order.pop();

        if (cur_county != prev_county) {
            output << cur_county << " " << county_queues[cur_county].front() << '\n';
            county_queues[cur_county].pop();
            prev_county = cur_county;
            if (!county_queues[cur_county].empty()) {
                county_order.push(cur_county);
            }
        } else {
            county_order.push(cur_county);
        }
    }

    output.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this version, we first read all the students and keep track of the count and existence of each county. We sort the students by county and then by student ID within each county. We then use a queue to hold the next county to process and ensure we alternate between different counties. As we process a student from a county, we move that county to the back of the queue unless it was the same as the previous county. This updated solution should generate the correct interleaved order of students by county.
