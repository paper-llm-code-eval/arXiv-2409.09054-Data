La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The code sorts the students by their county and then by their IDs within each county. Then, it writes out the required information to the output file, ensuring that no two consecutive students are from the same county and that students from each county are in ascending order of their IDs. It maintains the order of counties and the index of the last student outputted for each county to accomplish this.

The issue with the given solution is that it does not guarantee that consecutive students are from different counties. The provided code sorts students first by county and then by ID within the county but doesn't implement logic to ensure that no two consecutive students are from the same county when writing the output.

To address this problem, we need to adjust our approach. We need to create a data structure that allows us to track students from each county, and then we need to cycle through the counties in such a way that we always output a student from a different county, ensuring we follow the ascending order of IDs within the counties.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int county;
    int id;

    bool operator<(const Student& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // Use > for min-heap based on id
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;

    map<int, priority_queue<Student>> countyStudents;
    vector<int> participantCount(51, 0); // Max county id is 50, so use 51 for convenience
    
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int county, id;
        fin >> county >> id;
        countyStudents[county].push({county, id});
        participantCount[county]++;
    }
    fin.close();
    
    vector<int> countiesWithParticipants;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        if (participantCount[i] > 0) {
            countiesWithParticipants.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    fout << countiesWithParticipants.size() << '\n';
    for (int county : countiesWithParticipants) {
        fout << participantCount[county] << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    int lastCounty = 0;
    while (P > 0) {
        for (int county : countiesWithParticipants) {
            if (!countyStudents[county].empty() && county != lastCounty) {
                Student student = countyStudents[county].top();
                countyStudents[county].pop();
                fout << student.county << ' ' << student.id << '\n';
                lastCounty = student.county;
                --P;
                break; // Move to the next student
            }
        }
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a map of priority queues to maintain a min-heap of students for each county, ensuring that we always have the student with the lowest ID available for each county. We then loop through the counties, outputting one student at a time from different counties until all students are processed. This guarantees that no two consecutive students are from the same county while also respecting the ascending order of IDs within each county.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it is clear that the output does not reflect the requirement that no two consecutive students are from the same county. The output logic in the code is not correctly alternating between different counties. We need to maintain a round-robin approach to iterate through counties and ensure that after picking a student from one county, we move to the next available county for the subsequent student.

Let's re-implement the solution to ensure that consecutive students are always from different counties. To do this, we'll keep track of the last county we picked a student from and ensure the next county is different. We'll use a queue to cycle through the counties in a round-robin fashion.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int county;
    int id;
};

bool compareStudent(const Student& a, const Student& b) {
    if (a.county == b.county) {
        return a.id < b.id;
    }
    return a.county < b.county;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;

    vector<Student> students(P);
    vector<int> countyCount(51, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> students[i].county >> students[i].id;
        countyCount[students[i].county]++;
    }
    fin.close();

    sort(students.begin(), students.end(), compareStudent);

    vector<int> countyOrder;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        if (countyCount[i] > 0) {
            countyOrder.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    fout << countyOrder.size() << '\n';
    for (int county : countyOrder) {
        fout << countyCount[county] << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    vector<int> index(51, 0);
    int lastCounty = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < countyOrder.size(); ++j) {
            int county = countyOrder[j];
            if (county != lastCounty && index[county] < countyCount[county]) {
                Student& student = students[index[county] + county * 1000]; // Using 1000 as the maximum ID
                fout << student.county << ' ' << student.id << '\n';
                index[county]++;
                lastCounty = county;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution sorts the students first by county and then by their ID. It then uses a vector `index` to keep track of the last written student for each county. The main loop in the solution goes through the counties in a round-robin fashion and writes the next available student from a county different from the last one written. The `county * 1000` part ensures that we are accessing the correct student by offsetting within the sorted student vector.

Let's test this corrected solution with the provided input.

The problem with the previous solutions is the incorrect indexing of students and the flawed logic to ensure that two consecutive students are not from the same county. The use of `county * 1000` as an index offset does not guarantee the correct student due to the way the students are sorted and indexed.

To solve this challenge, we need to use a data structure that allows us to iterate through the counties cyclically and to pick the next student with the smallest ID from each county, while ensuring not to pick from the same county consecutively.

A correct approach can be to store students from each county in separate lists (sorted by their IDs), track the last county we picked a student from, and iterate over these lists in a cyclic manner.

Let's re-implement the solution with these ideas:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;

    vector<list<int>> countyStudents(51); // Lists to hold student IDs for each county
    vector<int> countyCount(51, 0);  // Count of students per county

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int county, id;
        fin >> county >> id;
        countyStudents[county].push_back(id);
        countyCount[county]++;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Sort students within each county by ID
    for (auto &students : countyStudents) {
        students.sort();
    }

    int NJ = 0;
    vector<int> countyOrder;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        if (countyCount[i] > 0) {
            NJ++;
            countyOrder.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    fout << NJ << '\n';
    for (int county : countyOrder) {
        fout << countyCount[county] << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    int lastCounty = 0;
    while (P > 0) {
        for (int currentCounty : countyOrder) {
            if (currentCounty != lastCounty && !countyStudents[currentCounty].empty()) {
                // Output the next student from the current county
                fout << currentCounty << ' ' << countyStudents[currentCounty].front() << '\n';
                countyStudents[currentCounty].pop_front();
                lastCounty = currentCounty;
                P--;
                break; // Move to the next student
            }
        }
        // If we've reached the end without finding a different county, reset lastCounty
        if (lastCounty == countyOrder.back()) {
            lastCounty = 0;
        }
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a `vector` of `list`s to keep student IDs sorted within their respective counties. We iterate over the counties in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that we select a student from a different county every time. If we reach the end of the countyOrder list without finding a different county (all remaining students belong to the same county), we reset the lastCounty to 0 to start over at the beginning of the countyOrder list. This way, we guarantee that every student we pick is from a different county than the previous student, unless all remaining students are from the same county.

My apologies for the previous incorrect solutions. It seems I made a mistake in resetting the `lastCounty`, as well as not properly handling the round-robin iteration over the counties. Let me correct the issue and provide a new solution that ensures the following:

- No two consecutive students are from the same county.
- Students from each county are listed in ascending order of their IDs.
- County iteration is handled correctly in a round-robin fashion.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int id;
    int county;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P, county, id;
    fin >> P;

    vector<vector<int>> students(51); // Students IDs indexed by county
    set<int> counties; // To maintain a unique list of county IDs

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        fin >> county >> id;
        students[county].push_back(id);
        counties.insert(county);
    }
    fin.close();

    // Sort student IDs within each county
    for (int i = 0; i < 51; ++i) {
        sort(students[i].begin(), students[i].end());
    }

    fout << counties.size() << '\n';
    for (int county : counties) {
        fout << students[county].size() << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    int lastCounty = 0;
    vector<int> indexes(51, 0); // Current index for each county

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        for (int currentCounty : counties) {
            // Skip if lastCounty is the same or there are no more students in this county
            if (lastCounty == currentCounty || indexes[currentCounty] == students[currentCounty].size())
                continue;

            fout << currentCounty << ' ' << students[currentCounty][indexes[currentCounty]] << '\n';
            indexes[currentCounty]++;
            lastCounty = currentCounty;
            break; // Move to the next student
        }
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a set to maintain unique county IDs and sort them naturally. We then sort the student IDs within each county. During output, we maintain the index of the next student for each county and ensure we always pick a student from a different county than the last, unless there are no more students available in any other county.

Let's test this corrected solution with the provided input.

The error indicates that the `sort` function has not been declared. This usually happens when the `<algorithm>` header, which contains the `sort` function, is not included. To fix the program, we need to include the `<algorithm>` header at the beginning of the source code.

            if (lastCounty == currentCounty || indexes[currentCounty] >= students[currentCounty].size())

This code should now compile without any errors and should provide the correct functionality as required by the problem statement. It will output a list of students from different counties, maintaining the requirement that two consecutive students must not be from the same county and that within each county, student IDs are listed in ascending order.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly follow the round-robin order when selecting students from the counties. It iterates through the set of counties directly, which may result in selecting two students from the same county consecutively if there are no available students from other counties. To ensure the correct order, we should maintain a queue of counties that have students left to select from and rotate through them.

Let's re-implement the correct solution by using a queue to handle the round-robin selection of counties properly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int id;
    int county;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;

    vector<vector<int>> students(51);
    set<int> uniqueCounties;
    vector<int> countyOrder;
    vector<int> studentCount(51, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int county, id;
        fin >> county >> id;
        students[county].push_back(id);
        if (uniqueCounties.insert(county).second) {
            countyOrder.push_back(county);
        }
        studentCount[county]++;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Sort the students within each county
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        sort(students[i].begin(), students[i].end());
    }

    fout << uniqueCounties.size() << '\n';
    for (int county : countyOrder) {
        fout << studentCount[county] << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    queue<int> countyQueue;
    for (int county : countyOrder) {
        if (!students[county].empty()) {
            countyQueue.push(county);
        }
    }

    int lastCounty = 0;
    while (!countyQueue.empty()) {
        int currentCounty = countyQueue.front();
        countyQueue.pop();

        if (currentCounty != lastCounty) {
            fout << currentCounty << ' ' << students[currentCounty][0] << '\n';
            students[currentCounty].erase(students[currentCounty].begin());

            if (!students[currentCounty].empty()) {
                countyQueue.push(currentCounty);
            }

            lastCounty = currentCounty;
        } else {
            countyQueue.push(currentCounty);
        }
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This new implementation uses a queue to store and cycle through the counties that have remaining students. It ensures that we do not select students from the same county consecutively unless there is no other option. Each time we select a student from a county, we remove that student from the list and re-add the county to the queue if there are still more students left. This guarantees that the next time we look for a student to select, it will not be from the same county as the previous one chosen.
