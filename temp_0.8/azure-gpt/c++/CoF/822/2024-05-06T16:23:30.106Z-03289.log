Lizuca are $n$ flori ornamentale de înălțimi $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$, exprimate în centimetri. Pentru a uda plantele, Lizuca stabilește următorul program: în prima zi va alege o plantă pe care o va uda, în a doua zi va alege două plante pe care le va uda, în ziua a treia va alege trei plante pe care le va uda și așa mai departe. Dacă o plantă este udată într-o anumită zi, atunci crește $1$ centimetru până la sfârșitul acelei zile, iar dacă nu este udată, rămâne la înălțimea pe care o avea la sfârșitul zilei precedente.

Upon analyzing the discrepancy between the expected and found output, we can see the issue is with the determination of the maximum number of days `K` that Lizuca can water her flowers without any of them reaching the height `H`.

The bug in the code is that it increments the day when `K` matches the total number of plants watered till that day, which is calculated using the formula `day * (day + 1) / 2`. However, this causes the day to increment prematurely before we complete the watering cycle for the current day. This is because `K` is being compared with the sum of a sequence up to `day`, but `K` also needs to go through the current day's watering cycle before moving to the next day.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("flori.in");
    std::ofstream fout("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    fin >> n >> H;

    std::vector<int> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) fin >> h[i];

    // Sort the plants by their initial heights to optimize the watering process
    std::sort(h.begin(), h.end());

    // Calculate the final heights and sum them up
    int S = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        S += h[i] + n - 1;  // Each plant grows n-1 cm
    }

    // Write the sum to the output file
    fout << S << '\n';

    // Determine the maximum number of days K
    int K = 0, day = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Check if watering a plant would make it reach or exceed height H
        if (h[i] + day >= H) {
            break;
        }
        // If today's watering is done, move to the next day
        if (i == (day * (day + 1)) / 2 - 1) {
            ++day;
        }
        ++K;
    }

    // Write the maximum number of days to the output file
    fout << day - 1 << '\n';

    // Close the files
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This version of the solution should give us the correct `K`. The loop now correctly increments the day after the current day's watering cycle is complete, ensuring that we do not prematurely increment the day. The output should now match the expected output, providing `10` for `S` and `2` for `K`.

It seems the previous solution still contains a bug in determining the maximum number of days `K`. The error lies in the loop where `day` is incremented. Let's revisit the logic for incrementing `day` and update the code accordingly.

The correct approach is to increment `day` after watering `day` plants on that day. We should compare `i + 1` (1-based index) with `day * (day + 1) / 2` to check if we have watered the correct number of plants for the current day before incrementing to the next day. It also seems that the previous solution still uses `K` incorrectly, since `K` is supposed to be the number of days, not the number of plants watered.

Let's implement the corrected logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("flori.in");
    std::ofstream fout("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    fin >> n >> H;

    int *h = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) fin >> h[i];

    // Sort the array to efficiently calculate the days
    std::sort(h, h + n);

    // Calculate the final heights and sum them up
    int S = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        S += h[i] + n - 1;  // Each plant grows n-1 cm
    }

    // Write the sum to the output file
    fout << S << '\n';

    // Determine the maximum number of days K
    int K = 0, plantsWatered = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= n; ++day) {
        for (int j = 0; j < day; ++j) {
            if (plantsWatered < n && h[plantsWatered] + day < H) {
                plantsWatered++;
            } else {
                // If we cannot water any more plants without exceeding H, stop and output K
                fout << K << '\n';
                delete[] h;
                fin.close();
                fout.close();
                return 0;
            }
        }
        K++; // Successfully watered for 'day' days
    }

    // If we finish the loop, we were able to water plants for n days without reaching H
    fout << K << '\n';

    // Free the memory and close the files
    delete[] h;
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code should now correctly calculate both `S` and `K`, providing the expected output of `10` for `S` and `2` for `K` for the given example input. The `day` variable represents the number of plants watered on that day, and `plantsWatered` keeps track of the total number of plants watered so far. We increment `K` only after a successful day of watering without any plant reaching height `H`.

Upon further evaluation, I see that the logic for incrementing the `day` counter is incorrect. The issue is that the `day` counter should only be incremented if we can complete watering the number of plants equal to the current day without exceeding the height `H`. The previous solutions attempted to increment the `day` counter based on the number of times plants were watered, which was flawed.

Let's fix the loop that calculates `K` by ensuring that we only increment the `day` after confirming that all plants selected for watering on that day can be watered without any reaching the height `H`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("flori.in");
    std::ofstream fout("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    fin >> n >> H;

    std::vector<int> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) fin >> h[i];

    // Sort the array to efficiently determine the maximum number of days
    std::sort(h.begin(), h.end());

    // Calculate the final heights and sum them up
    int S = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        S += h[i] + n - 1;  // Each plant grows n-1 cm
    }
    fout << S << '\n';  // Write the sum to the output file

    // Determine the maximum number of days K
    int K = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= n; ++day) {
        bool canWaterAll = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < day; ++i) {
            if (i >= n || h[i] + day >= H) {
                // Cannot water this plant today without exceeding height H
                canWaterAll = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (canWaterAll) {
            K++;  // If we watered all plants for the day successfully
        } else {
            break;  // Stop if we can't water all plants for the day
        }
    }

    fout << K << '\n';  // Write the maximum number of days to the output file

    // Close the files
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The corrected solution calculates the sum `S` as before and writes it to the output file. To calculate the maximum number of days `K`, it loops through each day and checks if all plants that need to be watered that day can be watered without exceeding the height `H`. If all plants can be watered successfully, `K` is incremented; otherwise, the loop breaks, and we write `K` to the output file.

The new input data presents a case that the previous solution does not handle correctly, as demonstrated by the incorrect output. The output is expected to be `17` for `S` and `3` for `K`, but the output found is `19` for `S` and `2` for `K`. There are two issues with the previous code:
1. The sum of the final heights (`S`) is being incorrectly calculated. The previous solution incorrectly assumed each plant will grow exactly `n - 1` centimeters, but this is not true because the number of plants watered each day increases.
2. The calculation of the maximum number of days (`K`) is also incorrect. We need to consider that the number of plants watered each day increases, and we need to select the shortest plants to water each day so that none of them reach the height `H`.

Let's correct the code considering these points:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("flori.in");
    std::ofstream fout("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    fin >> n >> H;

    std::vector<int> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) fin >> h[i];

    // Sort the array to efficiently determine the maximum number of days
    std::sort(h.begin(), h.end());

    // Calculate the sum of the final heights S
    int S = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= n; ++day) {
        // Water the shortest day plants
        for (int i = 0; i < day; ++i) {
            h[i]++;
        }
        // Sort again as the relative heights have changed
        std::sort(h.begin(), h.begin() + day);
    }
    // Calculate the sum S after all watering is done
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) S += h[i];
    fout << S << '\n';  // Write the sum to the output file

    // Determine the maximum number of days K
    int K = 0;
    std::sort(h.begin(), h.end()); // Sort the array again to start over
    for (int day = 1; day <= n; ++day) {
        bool canWaterToday = true;
        // Check if we can water the shortest day plants today
        for (int i = 0; i < day && canWaterToday; ++i) {
            if (h[i] + 1 >= H) {
                // Cannot water this plant today without exceeding height H
                canWaterToday = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (canWaterToday) {
            // Water the plants and increase their height
            for (int i = 0; i < day; ++i) {
                h[i]++;
            }
            K++; // Increment the day count
        } else {
            break; // Cannot water anymore without exceeding H
        }
    }

    fout << K << '\n';  // Write the maximum number of days to the output file

    // Close the files
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution calculates `S` by simulating the actual watering process day by day and updating plant heights accordingly. After watering plants each day, it sorts the plants to make sure the shortest plants are selected for watering the next day. Finally, it calculates `K` by simulating the watering process again and checking if any plant exceeds the height `H` each day.

The reported issue stems from the incorrect handling of the watering logic and growth calculation in the provided solution. To fix the discrepancy, we need to ensure the growth calculation (`S`) and the maximum number of watering days (`K`) are performed correctly.

Here is a revised solution that should correctly calculate both `S` and `K`:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("flori.in");
    std::ofstream fout("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    fin >> n >> H;

    std::vector<int> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> h[i];
    }

    // Sort the heights to make it easier to select the shortest plants each day.
    std::sort(h.begin(), h.end());

    // To calculate 'S', each plant gets watered 'n' days minus its rank when sorted.
    int S = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        S += h[i] + (n - (i + 1));
    }

    // To calculate 'K', we simulate the watering process without exceeding height 'H'.
    int K = 0, plants_watered = 0;
    while (K < n) {
        // For each day, water up to 'K + 1' shortest plants that haven't reached height 'H'.
        int day_water = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= K && plants_watered < n; ++i) {
            if (h[i] + 1 < H) {
                h[i]++;
                day_water++;
            }
        }
        if (day_water <= K) {
            // If we managed to water 'K + 1' plants today without any reaching height 'H'
            K++;
        } else {
            // If we can't water 'K + 1' plants without exceeding 'H', we stop.
            break;
        }
        plants_watered += day_water;
    }

    // Write 'S' and 'K' to the output file.
    fout << S << '\n' << K << '\n';

    // Close the file streams.
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution recalculates `S` by considering that on each day, Lizuca waters the shortest plants that have not yet reached the maximum height. The final height for each plant is its initial height plus the total number of days it gets watered, which is `n - its_rank`. For `K`, we simulate the watering process day by day. On each day, Lizuca waters the shortest plants possible without any plant exceeding the height `H`. We check if we can water `K + 1` plants each day. If at any point we cannot water `K + 1` plants without exceeding `H`, we break the loop and output the current `K` as our answer.

It appears that the previous solutions have had issues with correctly solving for `S` and `K`. Let's attempt to solve the problem again with a clear approach to both parts:

1. To calculate `S`, we need to sum the initial heights of all plants and then add the growth for each day. A plant grows if it's watered, so each plant will grow on exactly `n` days where `n` is the number of days Lizuca takes to water all her plants. We don't need to simulate each day of watering. Instead, we sum the initial heights and then add `n * (n - 1) / 2` because each plant is watered once every day.

2. To determine `K`, we simulate the watering process. Each day Lizuca waters one more plant than the previous day. A plant is chosen to be watered if it is the shortest plant that has not yet reached height `H`. The process stops when watering any remaining plant would cause it to reach or exceed height `H`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("flori.in");
    std::ofstream fout("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    fin >> n >> H;

    std::vector<int> h(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> h[i];
    }

    // Sort the heights to make it easier to select the shortest plants for watering.
    std::sort(h.begin(), h.end());

    // Calculate 'S' by adding initial heights and the growth over 'n' days.
    int S = 0;
    for (int height : h) {
        S += height;
    }
    S += n * (n - 1) / 2;  // The total growth of all plants over 'n' days.
    fout << S << '\n';

    // Determine 'K', the maximum number of days Lizuca can water the plants.
    int K = 0;
    bool canWater = true;
    for (int day = 1; day <= n && canWater; ++day) {
        for (int i = 0; i < day; ++i) {
            // Water the plant if it won't exceed height 'H'.
            if (h[i] + 1 < H) {
                h[i]++;
            } else {
                // Can't water this plant, so we stop the process.
                canWater = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        // If we were able to water 'day' plants, increase 'K'.
        if (canWater) {
            K++;
        }
    }

    fout << K << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}

```

The first loop calculates the sum of the initial heights, `S`, and then adds the total growth, which is the same for all plants and equals `n * (n - 1) / 2`. The second loop iterates for each day and attempts to water the shortest plants. If on any day, watering a plant would cause it to reach or exceed height `H`, the loop breaks, and `K` is no longer incremented.

This updated solution should now provide the expected output for the given input:

```
10
2
```
