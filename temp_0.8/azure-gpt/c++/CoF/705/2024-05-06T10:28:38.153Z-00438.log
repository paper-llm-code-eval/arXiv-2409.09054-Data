Gigel are o panglică alcătuită din benzi de $1 cm$ lăţime, colorate în diverse culori. Panglica are $N$ benzi, fiecare colorată cu una din $C$ culori, culori pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $C$. Gigel vrea ca la ambele capete ale panglicii să aibă aceeaşi culoare, dar cum nu poate schimba culorile benzilor, singura posibilitate rămâne tăierea unor bucăţi de la capete. 

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine modul de tăiere a panglicii astfel încât la cele două capete să fie benzi de aceeaşi culoare, iar lungimea panglicii obţinute să fie maximă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `panglica.in` conţine:

- pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ şi $C$ separate printr-un spaţiu;
- pe următoarele $N$ linii descrierea panglicii: pe fiecare linie un număr natural de la $1$ la $C$, reprezentând în ordine culorile fâşiilor ce alcătuiesc panglica.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `panglica.out` va conţine următoarele $4$ numere:

- pe prima linie numărul de fâşii rămase;
- pe linia a doua numărul culorii care se află la capete;
- pe linia a treia câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la începutul panglicii iniţiale;
- pe linia a patra câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la sfârşitul panglicii iniţiale

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq C \leq 200$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii alegeţi pe cea în care se taie cât mai puţin din partea de început a panglicii.

This C++ code reads from `panglica.in`, processes the panglica to find the longest same-color ends, and then writes the result to `panglica.out`. The code avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, and `scanf` as requested. Instead, it uses `std::ifstream` and `std::ofstream` for file I/O operations.

The initial solution did not correctly track the longest same-color sequence at the ends of the panglica. It only considered the sequence from the current index going forward and the sequence from the end going backward, without considering that we need the same color on both ends and the longest possible length. Therefore, we need a different approach to correctly solve the problem.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("panglica.in");
    std::ofstream out("panglica.out");

    int N, C;
    in >> N >> C;

    // Read all the colors into a vector.
    std::vector<int> colors(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> colors[i];
    }

    // Use maps to store the length of the same color from the start to any position.
    std::unordered_map<int, int> colorCountFromStart, colorCountFromEnd;

    // Count occurrences and lengths of color sequences from both ends.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (colorCountFromStart.find(colors[i]) == colorCountFromStart.end()) {
            colorCountFromStart[colors[i]] = 1;
        } else {
            colorCountFromStart[colors[i]]++;
        }

        if (colorCountFromEnd.find(colors[N - 1 - i]) == colorCountFromEnd.end()) {
            colorCountFromEnd[colors[N - 1 - i]] = 1;
        } else {
            colorCountFromEnd[colors[N - 1 - i]]++;
        }
    }

    // Find the longest same-color sequence at both ends.
    int max_length = 0, max_color = 0, start_cut = 0, end_cut = 0;

    for (auto &entry : colorCountFromStart) {
        int color = entry.first;
        int lengthAtStart = entry.second;
        int lengthAtEnd = colorCountFromEnd[color];  // length of the same color sequence at the end

        int total_length = lengthAtStart + lengthAtEnd;

        // Since we are counting from both ends, we must subtract 1 if it's the same color.
        if (colors[0] == color && colors[N - 1] == color) {
            total_length -= 1;
        }

        // Update the maximum length and the respective cuts.
        if (total_length > max_length || (total_length == max_length && start_cut > N - lengthAtStart)) {
            max_length = total_length;
            max_color = color;
            start_cut = N - lengthAtStart;
            end_cut = N - lengthAtEnd;
        }
    }

    // Calculate the correct number of cuts from the start and end.
    start_cut = colors[0] == max_color ? 0 : start_cut;
    end_cut = colors[N - 1] == max_color ? 0 : end_cut;

    // Write output.
    out << max_length << '\n';
    out << max_color << '\n';
    out << start_cut << '\n';
    out << end_cut << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution should read the input from `panglica.in`, process it to find the longest same-color sequence at the ends, and write the correct result to `panglica.out`. It ensures that the same color is at both ends and that the maximum length is preserved. Additionally, it respects the condition to cut as little as possible from the start of the panglica.

It appears there was a mistake in the logic of the previous code. The code needs to account for both starting and ending cut lengths correctly, especially in cases where the color at one end does not match the color at the other end. The current algorithm does not handle this situation properly, which leads to incorrect results.

The issue is that the code is not considering the longest color bands that can be formed by cutting from both ends of the panglica. We need to look for the color that allows for the longest band, considering the cuts from both ends.

Let's re-implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("panglica.in");
    std::ofstream out("panglica.out");

    int N, C;
    in >> N >> C;

    std::vector<int> colors(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> colors[i];
    }

    int max_band_length = 0, final_color = -1, cut_at_start = 0, cut_at_end = 0;

    // Find the longest band for each color.
    for (int color = 1; color <= C; ++color) {
        int length_at_start = 0;
        while (length_at_start < N && colors[length_at_start] == color) {
            length_at_start++;
        }

        int length_at_end = 0;
        while (length_at_end < N && colors[N - 1 - length_at_end] == color) {
            length_at_end++;
        }

        // Calculate the total length of the band for the current color.
        int total_band_length = length_at_start + length_at_end;
        if (length_at_start > 0 && length_at_end > 0) {
            total_band_length--; // Overlap when both ends have the same color.
        }

        // Update the maximum band length and cuts if we find a better option.
        if (total_band_length > max_band_length) {
            max_band_length = total_band_length;
            final_color = color;
            cut_at_start = length_at_start;
            cut_at_end = length_at_end;
        } else if (total_band_length == max_band_length && length_at_start < cut_at_start) {
            // Choose the solution with the least cut from the start.
            final_color = color;
            cut_at_start = length_at_start;
            cut_at_end = length_at_end;
        }
    }

    // Write output
    out << max_band_length << '\n';
    out << final_color << '\n';
    out << (cut_at_start == N ? 0 : cut_at_start) << '\n'; // If the entire length is cut, write 0.
    out << (cut_at_end == N ? 0 : N - cut_at_end) << '\n'; // Correct the end cut based on the total length.

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code attempts to handle all cases correctly. It iterates over each possible color, calculates the length of the band for that color at both ends, and updates the longest band found. It also makes a decision when two bands have equal length, favoring the one that requires less cutting from the start. Finally, it ensures the correct counts for cuts at the start and end, considering the special case when the entire length is to be cut.

Let's analyze the differences between the expected output and the found output:

Expected output:
```
4
2
1
1
```

Found output:
```
1
3
0
5
```

Clearly, the found output is not correct according to the problem statement. The expected output indicates that we want to keep a band of length 4 with color 2, cutting 1 strip from the start and 1 strip from the end. However, the found output suggests only keeping a band of length 1 with color 3, without cutting from the start and cutting 5 strips from the end, which is incorrect.

Let's address the bug in the previous code and provide a solution that matches the expected output:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("panglica.in");
    std::ofstream out("panglica.out");

    int N, C;
    in >> N >> C;

    std::vector<int> colors(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> colors[i];
    }

    int max_band_length = 0, final_color = -1;
    int start_cut = 0, end_cut = 0;
    int i = 0, j = N - 1;

    // Process bands from both ends towards the center, looking for matching colors.
    while (i < j) {
        if (colors[i] == colors[j]) {
            // Found matching colors, now find the total length of this color band.
            int current_color = colors[i];
            int length = 0;
            while (i <= j && colors[i] == current_color) {
                length++;
                i++;
            }
            while (j >= i && colors[j] == current_color) {
                length++;
                j--;
            }

            // Check if this is the longest band found so far, if yes, update.
            if (length > max_band_length) {
                max_band_length = length;
                final_color = current_color;
                start_cut = i - length; // Strips cut at the start for this color.
                end_cut = N - 1 - j;    // Strips cut at the end for this color.
            }
        } else {
            // Colors don't match, move towards center looking for a match.
            if (colors[i] != colors[i + 1]) i++;
            if (colors[j] != colors[j - 1]) j--;
        }
    }

    // If no band is found (i.e., all colors are different), just take the first color.
    if (max_band_length == 0) {
        max_band_length = 1;
        final_color = colors[0];
        start_cut = 0;
        end_cut = N - 1;
    }

    // Write output
    out << max_band_length << '\n';
    out << final_color << '\n';
    out << start_cut << '\n';
    out << end_cut << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation processes the panglica from both ends, looking for the longest band with the same color at both ends. When a matching color is found, it calculates the total length of that color band and updates the maximum length if necessary. If no matching colors are found, it defaults to a band of length 1 using the first color. This should provide the correct output according to the problem statement.

The previous solution still has a bug because it doesn't correctly identify the longest band of the same color that can be obtained by cutting from both ends. The algorithm should consider the frequency of each color and their positions to decide where to cut to maximize the remaining band length. It is important to understand we are only allowed to cut from the ends, not from the middle.

Let us correct the code by implementing a better algorithm that satisfies all conditions:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("panglica.in");
    std::ofstream out("panglica.out");

    int N, C;
    in >> N >> C;

    std::vector<int> colors(N + 1);
    // Maps to store the first and last occurrence of each color.
    std::unordered_map<int, int> firstOccurrence, lastOccurrence;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        in >> colors[i];
        // Record the first and last occurrences.
        if (firstOccurrence.find(colors[i]) == firstOccurrence.end()) {
            firstOccurrence[colors[i]] = i;
        }
        lastOccurrence[colors[i]] = i;
    }
    
    int max_length = 0, max_color = 0, cut_from_start = 0, cut_from_end = 0;
    
    for (const auto& kv : firstOccurrence) {
        int color = kv.first;
        int start_pos = kv.second;
        int end_pos = lastOccurrence[color];
        int total_length = end_pos - start_pos + 1;
        
        // Check if this is the best option so far.
        if (total_length > max_length || (total_length == max_length && start_pos < cut_from_start)) {
            max_length = total_length;
            max_color = color;
            cut_from_start = start_pos - 1;
            cut_from_end = N - end_pos;
        }
    }
    
    // Write output.
    out << max_length << '\n';
    out << max_color << '\n';
    out << cut_from_start << '\n';
    out << cut_from_end << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code iterates over each color and keeps track of the first and last positions where each color occurs. For each color, it calculates the longest possible band by considering the distance between the first and last occurrence. The algorithm then selects the longest band, and when bands are equal in length, it prefers the one that requires the least cutting from the start. This corrected algorithm should now provide the expected output.
