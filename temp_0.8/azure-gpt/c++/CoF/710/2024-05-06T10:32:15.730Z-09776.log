Principala misiune a unei expediții stiintifice este de a studia evoluția vieții pe o planetă nou descoperită. În urma studiilor efectuate, cercetătorii au asociat fiecărui organism viu descoperit pe acea planetă un cod caracteristic. Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

De asemenea, cercetătorii au observat că pentru orice organism viu de pe planetă, codurile caracteristice ale strămoșilor săi pe scara evoluției se pot obține prin ștergerea unor cifre din codul caracteristic al organismului respectiv, iar un organism este cu atât mai evoluat cu cât codul său caracteristic are o valoare mai mare.

# Cerință

Date fiind codurile caracteristice ale două organisme vii diferite, scrieți un program care să determine codul caracteristic al celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lor.


# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține:

* $n$ - codul caracteristic al primului organism
* $m$ - codul caracteristic al celui de-al doilea organism

# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` conține pe prima linie:

* $p$ – codul celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lui $n$ si $m$

# Restricții și precizări

* Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

It seems that the previous solution has a logic error. It only checked for matching characters when they are at the same position in both strings, but we need to find the longest common subsequence (not substring) that preserves the order of characters.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cod.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cod.out");
    
    std::string n, m;
    fin >> n >> m;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n.size() + 1, std::vector<int>(m.size() + 1, 0));

    // Compute the length of the longest common subsequence using dynamic programming
    for (size_t i = 1; i <= n.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = 1; j <= m.size(); ++j) {
            if (n[i - 1] == m[j - 1])
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            else
                dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
        }
    }

    // Backtrack to find the longest common subsequence
    std::string ancestor;
    size_t i = n.size(), j = m.size();
    while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
        if (n[i - 1] == m[j - 1]) {
            ancestor = n[i - 1] + ancestor;
            --i; --j;
        } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
            --i;
        } else {
            --j;
        }
    }

    fout << ancestor << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution uses dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two strings, which represents the code of the most evolved common ancestor. It then backtracks through the DP table to construct the actual LCS. The LCS is the correct approach to the problem since we want the largest value sequence that appears in both organisms' codes while maintaining the order, but not necessarily continuity.

The issue with the previous solution is that it finds the longest common subsequence (LCS), which is not the correct approach for this specific problem. Since we are looking for the most evolved common ancestor, we should be building the largest possible number from left to right, not just the longest sequence of matching digits.

We need to modify the approach to ensure that we are constructing the largest possible number that can be formed by both strings. Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cod.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cod.out");
    
    std::string n, m, ancestor;
    fin >> n >> m;

    // Variables to keep track of the current positions in strings n and m
    size_t pos_n = 0, pos_m = 0;

    // While there are digits left in both strings
    while (pos_n < n.length() && pos_m < m.length()) {
        // If the same digit is found in both strings, it's part of the ancestor
        if (n[pos_n] == m[pos_m]) {
            ancestor += n[pos_n];
            pos_n++;
            pos_m++;
            continue;
        }

        // Find the next matching digit in the longer string
        size_t next_pos_m = m.find(n[pos_n], pos_m);
        size_t next_pos_n = n.find(m[pos_m], pos_n);

        // Choose the next digit based on which matching digit comes first
        if (next_pos_m != std::string::npos && (next_pos_n == std::string::npos || next_pos_m <= next_pos_n)) {
            pos_m = next_pos_m + 1; // Skip to the next matching digit in m
            ancestor += n[pos_n];
            pos_n++;
        } else if (next_pos_n != std::string::npos) {
            pos_n = next_pos_n + 1; // Skip to the next matching digit in n
            ancestor += m[pos_m];
            pos_m++;
        } else {
            // No more matching digits found; stop searching
            break;
        }
    }

    fout << ancestor << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution looks for the next matching digit in both strings and chooses the digit that appears first among the two options. This ensures that we are building the largest number possible while adhering to the rules that the digits of the ancestor must come in the same order as they are in both offspring.

Upon reassessing the problem, it's clear that the task requires us to find the largest numeric subsequence that is common to both organisms, meaning that if a digit is present in both, it should be included in the ancestor's code in the order it appears in both sequences. It's not about the longest subsequence but rather the numerically largest possible ancestor code.

The previous solution was incorrect because it was trying to build the largest possible number, but it didn't ensure that all digits from both organisms were taken into account in the correct order.

The correct approach is to iterate through both strings from the end and build the ancestor code by taking the largest digit common to both sequences:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cod.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cod.out");

    std::string n, m, ancestor;
    fin >> n >> m;

    // Pointers starting at the end of each string
    int pointer_n = n.size() - 1;
    int pointer_m = m.size() - 1;

    // Traverse strings from the end to the start
    while (pointer_n >= 0 && pointer_m >= 0) {
        if (n[pointer_n] == m[pointer_m]) {
            // If both digits are equal, add it to the ancestor and move both pointers
            ancestor.push_back(n[pointer_n]);
            --pointer_n;
            --pointer_m;
        } else if (n[pointer_n] < m[pointer_m]) {
            // Move the pointer in string m backward to find a matching or larger digit
            --pointer_m;
        } else {
            // Move the pointer in string n backward to find a matching or larger digit
            --pointer_n;
        }
    }

    // Since we built the ancestor from the end, we need to reverse the string
    std::reverse(ancestor.begin(), ancestor.end());

    fout << ancestor << '\n';

    // Close the file streams
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution scans both strings from the end until the beginning, comparing the digits. When the digits are equal, that digit is part of the ancestor code. If they are not equal, we move backward in the string that has the smaller digit to find a matching or larger one. After finding all common digits, we reverse the ancestor code to get the correct sequence since we built it backward. This will give us the correct and largest common ancestor code.
