Principala misiune a unei expediții stiintifice este de a studia evoluția vieții pe o planetă nou descoperită. În urma studiilor efectuate, cercetătorii au asociat fiecărui organism viu descoperit pe acea planetă un cod caracteristic. Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

De asemenea, cercetătorii au observat că pentru orice organism viu de pe planetă, codurile caracteristice ale strămoșilor săi pe scara evoluției se pot obține prin ștergerea unor cifre din codul caracteristic al organismului respectiv, iar un organism este cu atât mai evoluat cu cât codul său caracteristic are o valoare mai mare.

# Cerință

Date fiind codurile caracteristice ale două organisme vii diferite, scrieți un program care să determine codul caracteristic al celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lor.


# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține:

* $n$ - codul caracteristic al primului organism
* $m$ - codul caracteristic al celui de-al doilea organism

# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` conține pe prima linie:

* $p$ – codul celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lui $n$ si $m$

# Restricții și precizări

* Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

int main() {

    // Traverse both the strings from the beginning and find the common subsequence
    while (i < n.size() && j < m.size()) {
        if (n[i] == m[j]) {
            result += n[i];
            i++; j++;
        } else if (n[i] < m[j]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ program will read the input from `cod.in`, determine the longest common subsequence of the two numbers (it's actually the common subsequence that is also the largest number achievable), and write the result to `cod.out`. It does not use `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf` for file operations, instead it uses `ifstream` and `ofstream` for reading and writing files, as per the task requirements.

After reviewing the initial solution, I see that the code is not correct because it tries to find a common subsequence by comparing the numbers from left to right, incrementing the pointers whenever characters match or the character in the first number is smaller. However, the task is to find the biggest common ancestor which might not always be found by simply traversing from the start of both strings.

A more appropriate approach is to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) that considers subsequences that do not have to occupy contiguous positions within the original sequences. This is a classic dynamic programming problem.

Here is the corrected version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cod.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cod.out");

    std::string n, m;
    fin >> n >> m;

    size_t n_len = n.length();
    size_t m_len = m.length();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n_len + 1, std::vector<int>(m_len + 1, 0));

    // Building the DP matrix for finding the longest common subsequence
    for (size_t i = 1; i <= n_len; ++i) {
        for (size_t j = 1; j <= m_len; ++j) {
            if (n[i - 1] == m[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Backtracking the DP matrix to find the LCS
    std::string result = "";
    size_t i = n_len, j = m_len;
    while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
        if (n[i - 1] == m[j - 1]) {
            result += n[i - 1];
            --i; --j;
        } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
            --i;
        } else {
            --j;
        }
    }

    // The LCS is built backwards, so we need to reverse it
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution constructs a matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the first `i` characters of `n` and the first `j` characters of `m`. After populating this matrix in a bottom-up manner, the code backtracks from `dp[n_len][m_len]` to reconstruct the longest common subsequence. By reversing the LCS, we obtain the actual sequence which is then written to `cod.out`. This approach ensures that we get the correct and most evolved common ancestor.

Upon further reflection, the longest common subsequence algorithm does not guarantee the largest numeric value for the common ancestor. It only guarantees the longest subsequence, which may not be the largest in numeric value. Therefore, the problem is not about finding the longest common subsequence, but instead, it is about finding the largest common numeric value that can be composed by removing digits from both original sequences.

To achieve this, we should use a greedy approach to build the largest common numeric value by comparing digit by digit and choosing the smallest next matching digit that appears in both sequences. We need to ensure that we leave enough room for subsequent matches.

Here is the corrected version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cod.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cod.out");

    std::string n, m, result = "";
    fin >> n >> m;

    // Pointers for traversing the two strings
    size_t i = 0, j = 0;

    // Traverse both the strings and find the largest common numeric value
    while (i < n.size() && j < m.size()) {
        // Look for the next matching digit in 'm' starting from 'j'
        size_t match_index = m.find(n[i], j);
        if (match_index != std::string::npos) {
            // If a match is found, add it to the result and move both pointers
            result += n[i];
            j = match_index + 1; // Move past the matching digit in 'm'
            i++; // Move to the next digit in 'n'
        } else {
            // If no match is found, move to the next digit in 'n'
            i++;
        }
    }

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution searches for each digit of `n` in the remaining part of `m`, starting from the current position of `j`. When a match is found, it is added to the result (since it contributes to the largest common numeric value), and both `i` and `j` are advanced (with `j` moving past the matching position). If no match is found for a particular digit in `n`, we simply advance `i`. This greedy approach ensures that we are choosing the smallest next matching digit that leaves room for the largest possible numeric value.
