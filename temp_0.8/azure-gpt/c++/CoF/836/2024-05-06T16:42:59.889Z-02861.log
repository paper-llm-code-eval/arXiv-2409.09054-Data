Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 200 \ 000$;
* Elementele șirului sunt numere naturale și au cel mult $6$ cifre
* Se acordă 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea corectă a celei mai mari puteri a unui element din șir și 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea numărului de elemente din şir care au cea mai mare putere.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, I found that it contains logical mistakes in calculating the power of elements. It does not correctly calculate the number of sequences in which an element is the maximum. The stack should keep track of the elements and the number of times they have occurred as a maximum, but the current approach doesn't account for the sequences formed by including the current element with the previous ones correctly.

The correct approach is to use a stack to maintain the indices of elements in a non-increasing order and calculate the number of sequences for which each element is the maximum, based on its position and the positions of other elements around it.

Here's the rewritten solution with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::ifstream fin("maxp.in");
std::ofstream fout("maxp.out");

int main() {
    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> a(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    // Stacks to keep track of the indices of elements in a non-increasing order
    std::stack<int> indices;
    std::vector<long long> power(N, 0); // Stores the power of each element

    long long maxPower = 0;
    int maxCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // While current element is greater than the stack's top, calculate the power
        while (!indices.empty() && a[i] > a[indices.top()]) {
            int idx = indices.top();
            indices.pop();
            long long left = idx - (indices.empty() ? -1 : indices.top());
            long long right = i - idx;
            power[idx] = left * right;
            maxPower = std::max(maxPower, power[idx]);
        }
        indices.push(i);
    }

    // Handling the remaining elements in the stack
    while (!indices.empty()) {
        int idx = indices.top();
        indices.pop();
        long long left = idx - (indices.empty() ? -1 : indices.top());
        long long right = N - idx;
        power[idx] = left * right;
        maxPower = std::max(maxPower, power[idx]);
    }

    // Count the number of elements with the max power
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (power[i] == maxPower) {
            maxCount++;
        }
    }

    fout << maxPower << "\n" << maxCount << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a stack to efficiently track the maximum sequences' endpoints and calculates the power of each element when it gets popped from the stack. After processing all elements, we have the power of each element calculated. Then we just need to find the maximum power and count the number of elements with that power. This solution should correctly output the expected result for the given inputs.

The current solution does not correctly handle sequences where the same maximum element appears more than once, and the program is not tracking the left and right boundaries correctly for elements that are equal to others in the sequence.

When we process an element that is equal to the one on the top of the stack, we should merge their powers since they contribute to the same sequences' counts. Moreover, when we find a new maximum, we need to properly calculate the sequences' counts, considering the existing elements in the stack and their respective counts.

Let's adjust the solution to handle these cases:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::ifstream fin("maxp.in");
std::ofstream fout("maxp.out");

int main() {
    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> a(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    // Stack to keep track of indices and power count
    std::stack<std::pair<int, long long>> stack;
    long long maxPower = 0;
    int maxCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        long long count = 1; // Every element can form a sequence by itself

        // While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the stack's top
        while (!stack.empty() && a[i] > a[stack.top().first]) {
            count += stack.top().second; // Add the sequences from the popped element
            stack.pop();
        }

        // If the current element is equal to the stack's top, merge their counts
        if (!stack.empty() && a[i] == a[stack.top().first]) {
            count += stack.top().second;
            stack.pop();
        }

        // Push the current element with its count onto the stack
        stack.push({i, count});

        // Update the maximum power and the count of elements with the maximum power
        if (count > maxPower) {
            maxPower = count;
            maxCount = 1;
        } else if (count == maxPower) {
            maxCount++;
        }
    }

    fout << maxPower << "\n" << maxCount << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution uses a stack to keep track of the index of each element and the count of sequences in which it is the maximum. When a new maximum is found, the counts of all smaller elements are added to the new maximum's count. For equal elements, their counts are merged. After processing all elements, we output the maximum power and the count of elements with that power. This should correctly calculate the powers and give the expected output for the given input.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle multiple maximum elements appearing in a sequence. Specifically, it fails to calculate the number of sequences correctly when a maximum element has appeared before. It should accumulate not just the count of the maximum elements but also the count of sequences contributed by these elements.

Let's rewrite the solution to address these issues:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::ifstream fin("maxp.in");
std::ofstream fout("maxp.out");

int main() {
    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> a(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    // Stack to keep track of indices and their left boundaries
    std::stack<int> s;
    // Vector to store the power of each element and the number of elements to its left
    std::vector<long long> left(N, 0), power(N, 0);

    // Calculate left boundaries and partial power for each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int count = 1;
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] <= a[i]) {
            if (a[s.top()] == a[i]) {
                count += left[s.top()];
                power[s.top()] = 0; // Reset the power of the same previous elements
                s.pop();
            } else {
                count++;
                s.pop();
            }
        }
        left[i] = count;
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Clear the stack for the next iteration
    while (!s.empty()) s.pop();

    // Calculate right boundaries and update power for each element
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int count = 1;
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] < a[i]) {
            count++;
            s.pop();
        }
        power[i] += left[i] * count; // Update power using left and right boundaries
        s.push(i);
    }

    long long maxPower = 0;
    int maxCount = 0;

    // Find the max power and the count of elements with that power
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (power[i] > maxPower) {
            maxPower = power[i];
            maxCount = 1;
        } else if (power[i] == maxPower) {
            maxCount++;
        }
    }

    fout << maxPower << "\n" << maxCount << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we first iterate over the elements from left to right to calculate the left boundaries and the number of elements to the left of each element that contributes to its power. Then we iterate from right to left to calculate the right boundaries and update the power considering both left and right boundaries. Lastly, we find the maximum power and the number of elements with that power. This approach should produce the expected output.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it seems that the approach taken to calculate the power of each element is incorrect. The power of an element is defined by the number of sequences where it is the maximum element. The previous solutions have attempted to calculate it using methods that ultimately didn't account for all such sequences. Let's try a different approach.

In this new approach, we will calculate the power of each element by keeping track of the leftmost and rightmost positions where the current element can be the maximum in a sequence.

To calculate the power of each element, we will use two passes: one from left to right and another from right to left. On the left-to-right pass, we will calculate how many times each element is the maximum element when starting a sequence from the left. On the right-to-left pass, we will do the same but for sequences starting from the right.

Here is the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("maxp.in");
    std::ofstream fout("maxp.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> a(N + 2); // Padding the sequence with 0s at both ends
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    std::vector<long long> left(N + 2, 0), right(N + 2, 0);

    // Left-to-right pass
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (a[i] > a[i - 1]) left[i] = left[i - 1] + 1; // Extend the sequence
        else left[i] = 1; // Start a new sequence
    }
    
    // Right-to-left pass
    for (int i = N; i >= 1; --i) {
        if (a[i] > a[i + 1]) right[i] = right[i + 1] + 1; // Extend the sequence
        else right[i] = 1; // Start a new sequence
    }

    long long maxPower = 0, countMaxPower = 0;

    // Calculate the total power for each element and find the maximum power
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (a[i] > std::max(a[i - 1], a[i + 1])) {
            long long totalPower = left[i] * right[i];
            if (totalPower > maxPower) {
                maxPower = totalPower;
                countMaxPower = 1;
            } else if (totalPower == maxPower) {
                countMaxPower++;
            }
        }
    }

    fout << maxPower << "\n" << countMaxPower << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the correct power for each element by considering the number of sequences that can be formed starting to the left and to the right of each element where it is the maximum. After both passes, we have the information needed to easily calculate each element's power and identify the maximum power and the count of elements having that power. This solution should now provide the expected output.

The previous approach was incorrect because it did not take into account sequences extending past adjacent elements that are strictly smaller. It also didn't correctly calculate the power of each element, which should be the number of non-empty sequences that the element is the maximum of, considering all possible contiguous subsequences that include it.

Let's correct the solution with a proper algorithm that accounts for all contiguous subsequences in which an element is the maximum. We will use a stack to maintain the indices of elements in a decreasing order and calculate the power considering the nearest greater elements on both sides.

We will also make sure to handle sequences correctly when we encounter equal elements. We need to ensure that we are treating sequences correctly when an element is equal to the previous one.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::ifstream fin("maxp.in");
std::ofstream fout("maxp.out");

int main() {
    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> a(N);
    std::vector<long long> power(N, 0), left(N, 0), right(N, 0);

    // Read the elements
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    std::stack<int> s; // Stack to keep track of indices
    // Calculate left limits
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] < a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        left[i] = s.empty() ? 0 : (s.top() + 1);
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Clear the stack for the right pass
    while (!s.empty()) {
        s.pop();
    }

    // Calculate right limits
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] <= a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        right[i] = s.empty() ? (N - 1) : (s.top() - 1);
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Calculate the power of each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        power[i] = (i - left[i] + 1) * (right[i] - i + 1);
    }

    // Find the maximum power and count how many times it occurs
    long long maxPower = 0;
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (power[i] > maxPower) {
            maxPower = power[i];
            maxCount = 1;
        } else if (power[i] == maxPower) {
            maxCount++;
        }
    }

    fout << maxPower << "\n" << maxCount << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the power of each element by finding the closest element to the left and to the right that are greater than the current element. This allows us to count the number of sequences in which the current element is the maximum. Finally, it finds the maximum power and counts the elements that have this maximum power. This approach should provide the expected result for the given input.

It seems the previous solution still does not handle sequences with equal elements correctly, particularly when an element appears more than once and is the maximum in those sequences. We need to adjust the algorithm to properly account for sequences that include equal maximum elements.

In this revised solution, we will use a different approach to handle equal elements. When we encounter an element that is equal to the previous element, we should combine their sequence counts since they can form sequences amongst themselves where they are the maximum.

Let's implement the correct algorithm:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::ifstream fin("maxp.in");
std::ofstream fout("maxp.out");

int main() {
    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> a(N);
    std::vector<long long> power(N, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    // Stack to keep track of indices and the count of sequences where the element is max
    std::stack<std::pair<int, long long>> stack;
    long long maxPower = 0;
    int maxCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        long long sequences = 1; // Each element can form a sequence by itself

        // Remove elements from the stack that are less than or equal to the current one
        while (!stack.empty() && a[stack.top().first] <= a[i]) {
            sequences += stack.top().second;
            stack.pop();
        }

        // If the stack is not empty, the current element can form additional sequences
        if (!stack.empty()) {
            sequences += stack.top().second;
        }
        
        // Update the power value for the current element
        power[i] = sequences;

        // Update max power and count
        if (sequences == maxPower) {
            maxCount++;
        } else if (sequences > maxPower) {
            maxPower = sequences;
            maxCount = 1;
        }

        // Push the current element and its sequences count onto the stack
        stack.push({i, sequences});
    }

    fout << maxPower << "\n" << maxCount << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we use a stack to keep track of elements and their associated sequence counts. We pop elements from the stack that are less than or equal to the current element and accumulate their sequence counts for the current element. This ensures that we correctly count the number of sequences where an element is the maximum, including handling equal elements appropriately. This updated solution should now yield the expected result.
