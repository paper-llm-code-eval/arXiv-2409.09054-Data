În fiecare zi lucrătoare din săptămână, Pinochio spune câte o minciună datorită căreia nasul acestuia crește cu câte $p$ centimetri pe zi. Sâmbăta și duminica, când vine bunicul Gepeto acasă, pentru a nu-l supăra prea tare, Pinochio reușește să nu spună nici o minciună, ba chiar uitându-se în oglindă observă că în fiecare din aceste zile lungimea nasului său scade cu câte $1$ centimetru pe zi. Când începe o nouă săptămână, rămânând singur acasă Pinochio continuă șirul minciunilor.

# Cerință

Care este dimensiunea nasului lui Pinochio după $k$ zile știind că inițial nasul său măsura $n$ centimetri.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `pinochio.in` se citesc valorile $n$, $p$, $k$, care se găsesc pe prima linie a fișierului și sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.


# Date de ieșire


În fișierul de ieșire `pinochio.out` se va afișa pe prima linie un singur număr natural, numărul de centimetri cerut de problemă.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq k \leq 256$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100$;

#include <fstream>

int main() {

    int n, p, k;

    int growth = weeks * 5 * p; // 5 working days in a week

    for (int i = 0; i < days; ++i) {
        if (i < 5) { // Monday to Friday
            growth += p;
        } else { // Saturday and Sunday

    }

    fout << n + growth << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```
This code reads the input from `pinochio.in`, calculates the size of Pinochio's nose after `k` days, and writes the output to `pinochio.out`. It avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, and `scanf` and aims to be efficient by minimizing the number of iterations needed to compute the nose's growth.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it seems there's a mistake in the initial implementation. The logic incorrectly calculates the growth during the weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, Pinochio's nose should shrink by 1 centimeter per day, regardless of whether these days are part of a full week or just additional days after full weeks.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("pinochio.in");
    std::ofstream fout("pinochio.out");

    // Declare integers for initial nose size, daily growth, and the number of days.
    int n, p, k;
    fin >> n >> p >> k;
    fin.close();  // Close the input file as it is no longer needed.

    // Calculate the total weeks and remaining days.
    int total_weeks = k / 7;
    int remaining_days = k % 7;

    // Calculate the net growth during the weekdays of the total weeks.
    int weekday_growth = total_weeks * 5 * p;

    // Calculate the net growth or shrinkage during the remaining days.
    int remaining_growth = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < remaining_days; ++i) {
        // From Monday to Friday, the nose grows.
        if (i < 5) {
            remaining_growth += p;
        } else {
            // On Saturday and Sunday, the nose shrinks.
            remaining_growth -= 1;
        }
    }

    // Calculate the final size of the nose.
    int final_size = n + weekday_growth + remaining_growth;
    
    // Write the final result to the output file.
    fout << final_size << std::endl;
    fout.close();  // Close the output file.

    return 0;
}
```
This implementation correctly accounts for the shrinkage during the weekend. It calculates the growth for the full weeks and then for any additional days, which may include weekend days where Pinochio's nose shrinks. Finally, it writes the correct nose size after `k` days to `pinochio.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result arises from a mistake in calculating the net effect of Pinochio's nose growth and shrinkage across the entire period, including both weekdays and weekends.

The error in my previous solution was that I did not correctly account for the shrinkage during the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) after full weeks had passed. My previous code only handled the shrinkage for additional days past complete weeks, but it did not account for the shrinkage that occurs every weekend. For every full week (7 days), Pinochio's nose would grow for 5 days and shrink for 2 days. If `k` is a multiple of 7, then the code would not consider any shrinkage at all.

Let's fix the solution by correctly calculating the net growth for each week, including the shrinkage during the weekends, and then handle the remaining days accordingly.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("pinochio.in");
    std::ofstream fout("pinochio.out");

    int n, p, k;
    fin >> n >> p >> k;
    fin.close(); // Close the input file as it is no longer needed.

    // Calculate the total growth after full weeks.
    int full_weeks = k / 7;
    int growth_after_weeks = (5 * p - 2) * full_weeks; // 5 days of growth and 2 days of shrinkage per week.

    // Calculate the growth or shrinkage for the remaining days.
    int remaining_days = k % 7;
    int remaining_growth = 0;
    for (int day = 1; day <= remaining_days; ++day) {
        // From Monday to Friday, the nose grows.
        if (day <= 5) {
            remaining_growth += p;
        } else {
            // On Saturday and Sunday, the nose shrinks.
            remaining_growth -= 1;
        }
    }

    // Calculate the final size of the nose.
    int final_nose_size = n + growth_after_weeks + remaining_growth;

    fout << final_nose_size << std::endl; // Output the final size of the nose.
    fout.close(); // Close the output file.

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution calculates the net growth each week as 5 days of growth minus 2 days of shrinkage, which should give the correct final size of Pinochio's nose after `k` days, taking into account both the growth on weekdays and the shrinkage on weekends. It will now produce the expected result.
