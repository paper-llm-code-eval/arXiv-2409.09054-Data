Un atelier de fabricat ceasuri cu cuc are nevoie de plăcuțe cu numerele pentru orele pe care trebuie să le așeze pe discul ceasurilor. Aceste numere sunt realizate la o imprimantă.

Din cauza unei erori imprimanta tipărește plăcuțe cu numere naturale, unele mai mari ca $12$. Atelierul poate utiliza doar plăcuțe cu numere cuprinse ı̂ntre $0$ și $12$. Pentru a utiliza aceste numere este nevoie ca ele să fie tăiate ı̂ncepând din partea dreaptă ı̂n grupuri de maximum două cifre, fiecare grup reprezentând valoarea de pe o plăcuță, care să fie o cifră la $0$ la $9$ sau unul dintre numerele $10$, $11$, $12$. Dacă pe o plăcuță se găsește un număr mai mare ca $12$ atunci plăcuța trebuie tăiată, astfel ı̂ncât ı̂n urma tăierii să se obțină numere de cel mult $2$ cifre. Dacă ı̂n numărul de pe o plăcuță cifra zecilor este $0$, atunci la prima tăiere se ia doar cifra unităților, altfel dacă numărul format cu cifra zecilor și unităților este mai mare ca $12$, atunci se taie prima dată cifra unităților, iar dacă numărul format cu cifra zecilor și unităților este $10$, $11$ sau $12$ se taie prima dată numărul format din ultimele două cifre, apoi procedeul se repetă până la tăierea completă a plăcuței. Imprimanta a realizat N plăcuțe. De exemplu dacă plăcuța este $12030$, după tăiere se obțin $0$, $3$, $0$, $12$.

# Cerință
1. Determinați numărul total de apariții ale cifrei $X$ pe plăcuțe ı̂nainte de tăiere.
2. Determinați numărul de tăieturi realizate conform enunțului.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului `ceas.in` se află valorile $C$, $X$ și $N$ separate prin câte un singur spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin câte un singur spațiu, având semnificația din enunț. Pentru $C = 1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$, iar pentru $C = 2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `ceas.out` conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural care reprezintă valoarea calculată conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq X \leq 9$;
* Valorile din șir sunt numere naturale $\leq 50 \ 000$;
* Pentru testele în care avem $C = 2$ valoarea $X$ este prezentă în fișierul de intrare chiar dacă nu este folosită în rezolvare.
* Pentru teste în valoare de $39$ de puncte avem $C = 1$
* Pentru teste în valoare de $61$ de puncte avem $C = 2$

Upon reviewing the provided code and the discrepancy with the expected output, we can see that the logic for counting the cuts has a mistake. The code reduces the `cuts` by 1 after each number is processed, assuming that the last cut for each number is not needed. However, this is an incorrect assumption.

The error is that we must not decrement the `cuts` if the number itself is already between 0 and 12, as in this case, there are no cuts needed for that number. 

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("ceas.in");
    std::ofstream out("ceas.out");

    int C, X, N, num, cuts;
    in >> C >> X >> N;

    if (C == 1) {
        int totalX = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            in >> num;
            while (num > 0) {
                if (num % 10 == X) {
                    ++totalX;
                }
                num /= 10;
            }
        }
        out << totalX;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        cuts = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            in >> num;
            if (num > 12) { // Only count cuts if the number is greater than 12
                while (num > 0) {
                    if (num % 100 <= 12) {
                        num /= 100;
                    } else {
                        num /= 10;
                    }
                    ++cuts;
                }
            }
        }
        out << cuts;
    }

    in.close();
    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the code should correctly count the number of cuts needed without making the final adjustment that was causing an off-by-one error for certain inputs. Specifically, it no longer erroneously decrements the `cuts` count for numbers that are already within the range of 0 to 12.

The program is still not providing the expected output. The mistake is in the logic used for counting the cuts. The current logic assumes that if a number is greater than 12, it needs to be cut, which increases the cuts count. However, we need to increment the cuts counter only when we actually perform a cut, which is when we divide `num` by 10 or 100. We must also ensure we don't increment the cuts counter when dividing the last remaining digits that are already in the range from 0 to 12.

Let's fix the code by adjusting the loop that counts the cuts. We will increment the cuts count only when we make a division by 10 or 100 on a number greater than 12, and we will not increment it for the last group of one or two digits that is already in the range 0 to 12.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("ceas.in");
    std::ofstream out("ceas.out");

    int C, X, N, num, cuts = 0;
    in >> C >> X >> N;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> num;
        // The cutting process should continue as long as num has more than two digits.
        while (num > 99) {
            int last_two_digits = num % 100;
            if (last_two_digits <= 12) {
                num /= 100;
            } else {
                num /= 10;
            }
            cuts++;
        }
    }

    out << cuts;
    in.close();
    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly calculate the number of cuts for each number, disregarding the last pair of digits if they are within the range 0 to 12. It should provide the expected output of 7 for the given input.

The previous solution did not handle all cases correctly. The error is in the logic that determines when to perform a cut (we need to account for cases where the last two digits are a valid number, 0 to 12, including 00 to 09, where we should treat 0 as a leading zero). 

To accurately reflect the correct number of cuts, we need to adjust our approach. If we have a number with more than two digits, we only cut from the right in groups of maximum two digits. However, if the last two digits are greater than 12, then we only cut the rightmost digit. If the last two digits are less than or equal to 12, then we cut two digits. We don't need to perform a cut if the number has only one or two digits and is already in the range 0 to 12.

Let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("ceas.in");
    std::ofstream out("ceas.out");

    // Read the type of task (C), the digit to count (X), and the number of plates (N)
    int C, X, N, num, cuts = 0;
    in >> C >> X >> N;

    // If we're solving task 2
    if (C == 2) {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            in >> num;

            // We perform cuts as long as the number has more than two digits
            while (num > 12) {
                int last_two_digits = num % 100;
                
                // If the last two digits form a number > 12, cut the last digit
                // If they form a number <= 12 (including single digit numbers), cut two digits
                if (last_two_digits > 12 || last_two_digits < 10) {
                    num /= 10;
                } else {
                    num /= 100;
                }
                cuts++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the computed number of cuts to the output file
    out << cuts;

    in.close();
    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution checks each number and performs cuts according to the rules specified in the task description. It correctly increments the `cuts` counter only when a cut is performed, and it should now provide the expected output.

The program output does not match the expected output because it only attempts to solve the second task, completely ignoring the first task due to missing logic for `C == 1`. The condition to only run the code for `C == 2` causes it to skip the part where we would count occurrences of the digit `X`.

Let's fix the solution by adding the necessary code to handle the case when `C == 1` to count the occurrences of the digit `X` before any cuts are made. We will also refactor the existing code for `C == 2` to correctly count the number of cuts. The final solution should handle both tasks correctly.

Here is the corrected solution for both `C == 1` and `C == 2`:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("ceas.in");
    std::ofstream out("ceas.out");

    int C, X, N, num;
    in >> C >> X >> N;

    int result = 0; // This will store the result for both tasks

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> num;

        if (C == 1) {
            // Count the occurrences of the digit X before any cuts
            int current_num = num;
            while (current_num > 0) {
                if (current_num % 10 == X) {
                    ++result;
                }
                current_num /= 10;
            }
        } else if (C == 2) {
            // Count the number of cuts needed to satisfy the constraints
            while (num > 0) {
                if (num % 100 <= 12 && num % 100 != 0) {
                    num /= 100; // Cut the last two digits if they form a valid number less than or equal to 12
                } else {
                    num /= 10; // Otherwise, cut only the last digit
                }
                ++result;
            }
            --result; // The last group forming a number 0-12 is not a cut
        }
    }

    out << result;

    in.close();
    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution now includes logic for both tasks. For `C == 1`, it counts the total occurrences of the digit `X`. For `C == 2`, it counts the number of cuts needed for each number to ensure that all resulting numbers are between 0 and 12. It correctly decrements the result by one for `C == 2` at the end of processing each number to account for the fact that the last group of digits that form a number from 0 to 12 is not a cut.

After reviewing the previous code and the results, it is clear there was an incorrect assumption about when to decrement the cuts count. For each number, we should not decrement the cuts count unconditionally after processing it, because doing so would fail to count the last cut required for numbers that do not end with a valid 1 or 2 digit number less than or equal to 12. We should instead track when we perform a division operation, as each division represents a cut.

Let's fix the solution by adjusting the logic for counting cuts to increment the cuts count only when a cut (division) is actually performed. The final cut for each number should be omitted only if that number is already between 0 and 12.

Here is the updated and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("ceas.in");
    std::ofstream out("ceas.out");

    int C, X, N, num, cuts = 0;
    in >> C >> X >> N;

    // If we're solving task 2 (counting the number of cuts)
    if (C == 2) {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            in >> num;
            
            // Only perform cuts on numbers larger than 12
            while (num > 12) {
                // If the last two digits form a number greater than 12 or a single digit number, cut the last digit
                if (num % 100 > 12 || num % 100 < 10) {
                    num /= 10;
                } else { // If they form a number less than or equal to 12, cut the last two digits
                    num /= 100;
                }
                ++cuts; // Increment the cuts count for each cut
            }
        }
    }

    out << cuts;
    in.close();
    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

Now, the solution should provide the correct number of cuts for the input data provided, as it increments the cuts counter each time a division is performed and stops cutting once the number is reduced to 12 or less. This should yield the expected output of 7 for the input provided.

The problem arises because the latest solution provided does not include code to handle the case when `C == 1`, which is required to count the total occurrences of the digit `X` before any cuts are made. The solution provided only attempts to solve the second part of the problem.

Let's fix the solution by reintroducing the logic to handle the case when `C == 1`. We will also keep the logic to handle the case when `C == 2` to count the number of cuts.

Here is the updated solution that handles both cases:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("ceas.in");
    std::ofstream out("ceas.out");

    int C, X, N, num;
    in >> C >> X >> N;

    int result = 0; // Variable to hold the result for both tasks

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> num;

        if (C == 1) {
            // Count the occurrences of the digit X before any cuts
            while (num > 0) {
                if (num % 10 == X) {
                    ++result;
                }
                num /= 10;
            }
        } else if (C == 2) {
            // Count the number of cuts needed to satisfy the constraints
            while (num > 12) {
                if (num % 100 > 12 || num % 100 < 10) {
                    num /= 10; // Cut the last digit if the last two digits are greater than 12 or less than 10
                } else {
                    num /= 100; // Cut the last two digits if they form a number less than or equal to 12
                }
                ++result; // Increment the cut count
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the result to the output file
    out << result;

    in.close();
    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now handle both tasks correctly. For `C == 1`, it counts the occurrences of the digit `X` in all the numbers. For `C == 2`, it counts the number of cuts required to reduce each number to a value between 0 and 12, following the rules described in the challenge. This solution should give the expected output of 4 for the input provided for `C == 1` and 7 for the input provided for `C == 2`.
