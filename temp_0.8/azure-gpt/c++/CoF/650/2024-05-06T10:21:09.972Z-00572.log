Se dă o matrice $A$ cu $N$ linii și $M$ coloane, cu valori cuprinse între $1$ și $N \cdot M$ inclusiv, nu neapărat distincte. O **operație** constă în selectarea a două linii sau două coloane consecutive și interschimbarea acestora (swap). O matrice **yin-yang** este o matrice în care $A[i][j] \geq A[i][j – 1]$, pentru orice pereche $(i, j)$ cu $1 \leq i \leq N$ și $2 \leq j \leq M$ și $A[i][j] \geq A[i – 1][j]$, pentru orice pereche $(i, j)$ cu $2 \leq i \leq N$ și $1 \leq j \leq M$.

# Cerinţă

This solution reads the matrix from `yinyang.in`, checks if it is already a yin-yang matrix, and if not, it first checks if there are any duplicate elements, which would make sorting impossible. Then it sorts the rows and the columns while counting the number of swaps required. After sorting, it checks again if the matrix is a yin-yang matrix. If it is, it writes the number of swaps to `yinyang.out`; otherwise, it writes `-1`.

The initial solution incorrectly assumes that if there are duplicate elements in the matrix, it is impossible to sort it into a yin-yang matrix. This assumption is incorrect because even with duplicate elements, a yin-yang matrix could be possible by swapping rows or columns.

Another issue is that the initial solution tries to sort rows and columns individually, but this approach does not consider the global order of the elements. A correct approach needs to consider both rows and columns simultaneously.

To fix these issues, I will rewrite the solution using a different strategy. Given the constraints, we can permute rows and columns to sort the matrix into a yin-yang pattern. The existence of duplicate elements does not necessarily make it impossible to create a yin-yang matrix, but it requires more careful checking of the ordering conditions.

Here's the updated solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int main() {
    int n, m;
    fin >> n >> m;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(n, std::vector<int>(m));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            fin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Close the input file as we have finished reading from it.
    fin.close();

    std::vector<int> row_indices(n), col_indices(m);
    std::iota(row_indices.begin(), row_indices.end(), 0);
    std::iota(col_indices.begin(), col_indices.end(), 0);

    // Lambda to check if the current permutation of rows and columns forms a yin-yang matrix.
    auto is_yinyang = [&](const std::vector<int>& ridx, const std::vector<int>& cidx) {
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; ++j) {
                if (matrix[ridx[i]][cidx[j]] < matrix[ridx[i - 1]][cidx[j]] ||
                    matrix[ridx[i]][cidx[j]] < matrix[ridx[i]][cidx[j - 1]]) {
                    return false;
                }

    do {
        do {
            if (is_yinyang(row_indices, col_indices)) {
                int row_swaps = 0, col_swaps = 0;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    if (row_indices[i] != i) {
                        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                            if (row_indices[j] == i) {
                                std::swap(row_indices[i], row_indices[j]);
                                ++row_swaps;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }

                            if (col_indices[j] == i) {
                                std::swap(col_indices[i], col_indices[j]);
                                ++col_swaps;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                int total_swaps = row_swaps + col_swaps;
                if (min_swaps == -1 || total_swaps < min_swaps) {
                    min_swaps = total_swaps;

            }

    return 0;
}
```

This solution tries all permutations of rows and columns to find the minimum number of swaps required to transform the matrix into a yin-yang matrix. It uses a lambda function to check if a given permutation satisfies the yin-yang condition. If it does, it calculates the number of swaps needed to achieve that configuration from the original order of rows and columns. The result is the minimum number of swaps found across all valid permutations, which is then written to the output file.

The error message indicates that the `iota` function, which is used to generate increasing sequences, is not recognized as a member of `std`. This is likely because the `<numeric>` header, where `iota` is defined, was not included.

To fix the program, we need to add `#include <numeric>` at the top of the source code to include the proper header that defines `iota`. However, even with that fix, the proposed solution is not efficient due to the use of permutations which have a factorial time complexity and will not finish in a reasonable time for larger inputs.

Let's attempt a different strategy that does not involve checking all permutations. This problem requires a more efficient algorithmic approach to be feasible within the constraints.

Here's an attempt at an efficient and correct solution that takes into account the properties of a yin-yang matrix:

```cpp

    }

    // Since sorting rows and columns independently does not interfere with each other,
    // we can count the inversions for rows and columns separately.

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::vector<int> row(matrix[i]);

                if (it != row.end()) {
                    std::iter_swap(it, row.begin() + j);
                    ++row_swaps;
                } else {

    }

This solution checks whether the given matrix is already sorted in yin-yang order. If not, it counts the number of swaps needed to sort each row and each column. If an element cannot be found in the sorted version of the row or column, the output is `-1`, indicating that sorting is impossible. Otherwise, the sum of row and column swaps is the answer. This approach ensures that we do not have unnecessary permutations and that we check the feasibility of creating a yin-yang matrix.

The found output does not match the expected output because the solution incorrectly counts the number of swaps needed to sort each row and each column independently. This approach is flawed when considering the interdependence between the rows and columns to achieve a yin-yang matrix. The previous implementation doesn't take into account that sorting rows and columns might interfere with each other's order when swaps are made.

To fix this, we need to come up with an algorithm that considers both rows and columns together. However, calculating the exact minimum number of swaps required to sort a matrix is a complex problem that resembles the puzzle of sorting with the minimum number of adjacent swaps, which is known to be NP-hard in a general case. Our problem is slightly different and requires custom logic due to the unique constraints of the yin-yang matrix.

We need to iterate over each row and column, and for each position `(i, j)`, if the value is not in increasing order compared to its left and top neighbors, we must count this as an anomaly that requires fixing. If a row or column swap can fix the anomaly, we count this as a potential swap. Then we can try applying these swaps one by one, ensuring the result maintains the yin-yang property.

A more efficient approach, though, is recognizing that we can sort the first row and column independently without affecting each other, because swapping rows does not affect the order of the columns and vice versa. Once the first row and column are sorted, we can check if the rest of the matrix already satisfies the yin-yang property. If not, the operation is impossible, since any swap would break the sorted order of the first row or column.

Here's a corrected and more efficient solution that avoids unnecessary permutations and directly addresses the yin-yang matrix requirements:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int count_swaps(std::vector<int>& vec) {
    int swaps = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        if (vec[i] != i + 1) {
            auto it = std::find(vec.begin() + i, vec.end(), i + 1);
            if (it != vec.end()) {
                std::iter_swap(it, vec.begin() + i);
                ++swaps;
            } else {
                return -1; // Cannot sort due to missing elements
            }
        }
    }
    return swaps;
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    fin >> n >> m;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(n, std::vector<int>(m));
    std::vector<int> row(n), col(m);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)
            fin >> matrix[i][j];

    fin.close();

    // Extract the first row and column for independent sorting
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) row[i] = matrix[i][0];
    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) col[j] = matrix[0][j];

    // Count the swaps needed for the first row and column
    int row_swaps = count_swaps(row);
    int col_swaps = count_swaps(col);

    if (row_swaps == -1 || col_swaps == -1) {
        fout << "-1\n";
    } else {
        // Check the rest of the matrix
        bool valid = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < n && valid; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m && valid; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] < matrix[i - 1][j] || matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j - 1]) {
                    valid = false;
                }
            }
        }
        fout << (valid ? row_swaps + col_swaps : -1) << "\n";
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution focuses on sorting the first row and the first column and then checks if the rest of the matrix satisfies the yin-yang property. It uses a function `count_swaps` to count the number of swaps needed to sort a sequence and to check for a possible `-1` condition if an element is out of place and cannot be swapped to sort the sequence. If the first row and column can be sorted with swaps and the rest of the matrix maintains the yin-yang order, those are the only swaps needed. If not, it is impossible to achieve a yin-yang matrix, and the program outputs `-1`.

The latest provided solution still contains a logic error. It incorrectly assumes that if the first row and column are sorted, then the rest of the matrix must satisfy the yin-yang property, which is not necessarily true. The example given has a matrix that is already a yin-yang matrix, and thus, no swaps are needed. The expected result is "0", but the found output is "-1" because the code is not checking the rest of the matrix correctly after sorting the first row and column.

To correct this, we need to ensure that we are not modifying the original matrix when sorting the first row and column. Instead, we should create a copy of the first row and column, sort these copies, and use them to check if the rest of the matrix satisfies the yin-yang property without actually swapping any elements in the matrix. This way, we can accurately determine if the matrix is already a yin-yang matrix, or if it can be turned into one with a series of swaps.

Here's a revised solution that addresses this issue:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int main() {
    int n, m;
    fin >> n >> m;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(n, std::vector<int>(m));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            fin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Close the input file as we have finished reading from it.
    fin.close();

    // Copy the first row and first column
    std::vector<int> first_row(matrix[0]), first_col(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        first_col[i] = matrix[i][0];
    }

    // Sort the first row and first column
    std::sort(first_row.begin(), first_row.end());
    std::sort(first_col.begin(), first_col.end());

    // Check if the sorted first row and first column form a yin-yang pattern
    // with the rest of the matrix.
    bool valid = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n && valid; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m && valid; ++j) {
            if (i == 0) {
                // Check against the sorted first row
                if (matrix[i][j] != first_row[j]) {
                    valid = false;
                }
            } else if (j == 0) {
                // Check against the sorted first column
                if (matrix[i][j] != first_col[i]) {
                    valid = false;
                }
            } else {
                // Check against the previous elements in the matrix
                if (matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j - 1] || matrix[i][j] < matrix[i - 1][j]) {
                    valid = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // The number of swaps required to sort the first row and first column
    int row_swaps = 0, col_swaps = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        if (first_row[i] != matrix[0][i]) {
            row_swaps++;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (first_col[i] != matrix[i][0]) {
            col_swaps++;
        }
    }

    // If the matrix is valid, the number of swaps needed is the sum of swaps
    // for the first row and first column. Otherwise, it is impossible.
    fout << (valid ? (row_swaps + col_swaps) / 2 : -1) << std::endl;

    // Close the output file as we have finished writing to it.
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

Each swap in the first row or column is counted twice, once for each element involved, so we divide the total count by two to get the correct number of swaps. This solution checks the sorted first row and column against the rest of the matrix to ensure that the yin-yang property is satisfied without modifying the matrix itself. If the sorted first row and column are consistent with the yin-yang property throughout the matrix, the solution outputs the sum of row and column swaps divided by two. If not, it outputs "-1".

The current solution is still not handling the swaps between rows and columns correctly. It is not enough to sort the first row and column separately and check if they align with the rest of the matrix. The nature of a yin-yang matrix requires that, after the eventual swapping, all elements still adhere to the property that each element is greater than or equal to the one above it and to the left of it, and this must hold for the entire matrix, not just the first row and column.

Given the constraints of the problem, the number of rows and columns can be up to 100, which means that brute-forcing through all permutations is not feasible. However, one key observation is that a yin-yang matrix is essentially a sorted matrix when you read it in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right manner (like reading a book). This means that if we read all the elements of the matrix into a single array, sort it, and then attempt to place it back into the matrix, we should expect to find the array elements in order as we read through the matrix in the same top-to-bottom, left-to-right manner.

To check for the possibility of forming a yin-yang matrix, we can apply this strategy and count the number of rows and columns that are out of place. The minimum swaps required will be the greater of the two counts (out-of-place rows or columns), since we can fix either a row or a column in a single swap.

Let's implement this corrected strategy:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

    int n, m;
    fin >> n >> m;
    std::vector<int> values(n * m);
    for (int i = 0; i < n * m; ++i) {
        fin >> values[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    // Read matrix into a single vector and sort it.
    std::vector<int> sorted_values = values;
    std::sort(sorted_values.begin(), sorted_values.end());

    // Count out-of-place rows and columns.
    int rows_out_of_place = 0, cols_out_of_place = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            if (values[i * m + j] != sorted_values[i * m + j]) {
                rows_out_of_place = std::max(rows_out_of_place, i);
            }
        }
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (values[i * m + j] != sorted_values[i * m + j]) {
                cols_out_of_place = std::max(cols_out_of_place, j);
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the minimum number of swaps. If no rows or columns are out of place, no swaps are needed.
    int min_swaps = 0;
    if (rows_out_of_place > 0 || cols_out_of_place > 0) {
        min_swaps = std::max(rows_out_of_place, cols_out_of_place);
    }

    fout << min_swaps << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the minimum number of swaps required to order the matrix elements into a yin-yang matrix by checking how many rows and columns are out of place after sorting all values. The output is the maximum of these two counts, which represents the minimum number of swaps needed. If no rows or columns are out of place, the output is 0.

The given solution is providing incorrect output because it is based on a flawed understanding of how to transform the given matrix into a yin-yang matrix. The approach of counting out-of-place rows and columns does not accurately reflect the structure of a yin-yang matrix, as it doesn't account for the relative positions of the elements and the fact that rows and columns can be swapped.

To properly solve this challenge, we need to check if we can sort the matrix into a yin-yang formation without disjoint swaps. The first step is to determine if the elements in the first row and first column can be placed in ascending order through swaps. If not, the transformation is impossible. If they can be ordered, we then need to ensure that the remaining elements in the matrix can also be placed in such a way that the yin-yang property holds.

Here's a revised solution that attempts to correctly address the problem:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int main() {
    // Read the dimensions and elements of the matrix
    int n, m;
    fin >> n >> m;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(n, std::vector<int>(m));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            fin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }
    fin.close();

    int operations = 0;
    // Trying to make the first column in ascending order
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (matrix[i][0] < matrix[i-1][0]) {
            // Swapping the entire rows
            std::swap(matrix[i], matrix[i-1]);
            operations++;
        }
    }

    // Trying to make the first row in ascending order
    for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
        if (matrix[0][j] < matrix[0][j-1]) {
            // Swapping the entire columns
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                std::swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j-1]);
            }
            operations++;
        }
    }

    // Checking if the matrix is yin-yang
    bool yin_yang = true;
    for (int i = 1; i < n && yin_yang; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < m && yin_yang; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] < matrix[i-1][j] || matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j-1]) {
                yin_yang = false;
            }
        }
    }

    fout << (yin_yang ? operations : -1) << "\n";
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution first tries to sort the first column by swapping rows if necessary, then it tries to sort the first row by swapping columns if necessary. After these two steps, it checks if the matrix is a yin-yang matrix. If it is, it writes the number of operations to the output file; otherwise, it writes -1. This solution should accurately reflect the minimal number of operations needed to create a yin-yang matrix or determine if it's impossible.
