#include <fstream>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");

int main() {
    int N, M;
    fin >> N >> M;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A(N, std::vector<int>(M));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j)
            fin >> A[i][j];

    // The matrix is yin-yang if both rows and columns are non-decreasing.
    // To minimize operations, we first sort each row and then check if the columns are sorted.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::sort(A[i].begin(), A[i].end());
    }

    // Check if columns are non-decreasing.
    bool is_yang = true;
    for (int j = 0; j < M && is_yang; ++j) {
        for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
            if (A[i][j] < A[i - 1][j]) {
                is_yang = false;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // The result is either 0 operations if the matrix is already yin-yang
    // or -1 if it's impossible to make it yin-yang.
    fout << (is_yang ? 0 : -1) << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```
The code above reads the matrix from `yinyang.in`, sorts each row individually, and then checks whether the columns are sorted in non-decreasing order. If the matrix is already yin-yang after sorting rows, the number of operations needed is `0`; otherwise, it is impossible to obtain a yin-yang matrix, and the output is `-1`. The solution assumes that swapping any rows or columns cannot make an unsorted matrix sorted, which is true only when elements are distinct. In the case of non-distinct elements, the problem is more complex and requires a different approach.

The provided code incorrectly assumes that by sorting each row, the matrix can be made yin-yang without further operations. However, swapping rows or columns can actually lead to a yin-yang matrix even when initial rows are not sorted individually after sorting.

The task is to count the minimum number of swaps of consecutive rows or columns to make the matrix yin-yang. Unfortunately, the code does not account for the fact that swapping rows or columns can indeed affect the matrix's order. In the given example, by swapping the rows, then the second and third column, a yin-yang matrix can be formed, leading to a total of 3 swaps.

We need to re-implement the algorithm to solve the problem as described. Here is the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int main() {
    int N, M;
    fin >> N >> M;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A(N, std::vector<int>(M));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j)
            fin >> A[i][j];

    // Check if matrix is already yin-yang
    bool is_yin_yang = true;
    for (int i = 1; i < N && is_yin_yang; ++i)
        for (int j = 1; j < M && is_yin_yang; ++j)
            is_yin_yang &= A[i][j] >= A[i - 1][j] && A[i][j] >= A[i][j - 1];

    if (is_yin_yang) {
        fout << "0\n";
    } else {
        // The problem requires a more complex algorithm to count swaps.
        // Since the problem's constraints are small, we can use a brute-force
        // approach to simulate all possible swaps and then check if the matrix is yin-yang.
        int min_swaps = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
        // Check all possible combinations of row and column swaps.
        for (int r = 0; r < N - 1; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < M - 1; ++c) {
                int swaps = 0;
                std::vector<std::vector<int>> B = A;
                // Simulate swapping rows and columns as needed.
                for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i) { std::swap(B[i], B[i + 1]); swaps++; }
                for (int j = 0; j < c; ++j) { for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) std::swap(B[i][j], B[i][j + 1]); swaps++; }

                // Check if B is yin-yang
                bool valid = true;
                for (int i = 1; i < N && valid; ++i)
                    for (int j = 1; j < M && valid; ++j)
                        valid &= B[i][j] >= B[i - 1][j] && B[i][j] >= B[i][j - 1];

                if (valid) min_swaps = std::min(min_swaps, swaps);
            }
        }
        if (min_swaps == std::numeric_limits<int>::max())
            fout << "-1\n";
        else
            fout << min_swaps << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code still checks if the matrix is already yin-yang. If it is not, it uses a brute-force approach, considering all possible row and column swaps, to find the minimum number of swaps required to make the matrix yin-yang. If no solution is found, it outputs `-1`; otherwise, it outputs the number of swaps. Please note that this solution is not the most efficient due to its brute-force nature, but given the constraints of N and M (each being at most 100), this approach should usually work within a reasonable amount of time. However, for the largest input sizes, performance could become an issue.

The solution I provided still doesn't solve the problem correctly. My previous attempt did not properly explore all possible swaps that could lead to a yin-yang matrix.

To solve this problem, we need to consider each possible swap step-by-step and determine if it brings us closer to a yin-yang matrix. This is a more complicated problem than initially assumed, as it involves exploring a potentially large number of configurations. However, a brute-force approach will not work efficiently due to the combinatorial explosion of swap possibilities (which could be as high as factorial in nature).

An efficient solution likely involves a form of dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm that can prune the search space effectively. Unfortunately, without further insight into such an algorithm, we would not be able to provide an adequate solution under the current constraints of the problem.

Given the complexity of the problem, creating an efficient algorithm that guarantees finding the minimum number of swaps for any arbitrary input within the constraints is beyond the scope of this platform.

As a result, I will not attempt to write another incorrect or inefficient solution, and I recommend considering this problem as potentially unsolved or seeking a more advanced algorithm designed for this specific type of matrix transformation problem.

As a result, I will not attempt to write another incorrect or inefficient solution, and I recommend considering this problem as potentially unsolved or seeking a more advanced algorithm designed for this specific type of matrix transformation problem.I apologize for the oversight. Let's re-evaluate the problem and attempt to write a correct solution. We can start by sorting the matrix by rows and see if sorting by columns can be done with the minimum number of swaps. However, unlike before, we cannot assume that sorting each row individually will yield a yin-yang matrix.

In the given example:

```
2 3
6 6 5
4 6 2
```

The matrix can be turned into a yin-yang matrix by applying three operations:

1. Swap the first and second rows.
2. Swap the second and third columns.
3. Swap the first and second rows again.

This yields the yin-yang matrix:

```
4 5 6
6 6 2
```

We can see that sorting each row individually is not required, and the sorting step can in fact disrupt the yin-yang pattern. 

We can use a greedy algorithm that always performs the operation which brings the largest element in the top-left corner. This element should be either in the first row or in the first column. If that's not possible, then it's not possible to sort the matrix into a yin-yang matrix.

Here is the solution implementing the greedy approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int main() {
    int N, M;
    fin >> N >> M;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A(N, std::vector<int>(M));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j)
            fin >> A[i][j];

    int operations = 0;

    // Greedy approach to bring the largest element to the top-left corner
    // by swapping rows and columns, aiming for a yin-yang matrix.
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < N - 1 || j < M - 1;) {
        int max_i = i, max_j = j;
        for (int k = i; k < N; ++k) {
            if (A[k][j] > A[max_i][max_j]) {
                max_i = k;
                max_j = j;
            }
        }
        for (int k = j; k < M; ++k) {
            if (A[i][k] > A[max_i][max_j]) {
                max_i = i;
                max_j = k;
            }
        }

        if (max_i != i) {
            std::swap(A[i], A[max_i]);
            operations++;
        } else if (max_j != j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {
                std::swap(A[k][j], A[k][max_j]);
            }
            operations++;
        }

        if (A[i][j] == A[i + 1][j] && A[i][j] == A[i][j + 1]) {
            i++; j++;
        } else if (A[i][j] == A[i + 1][j]) {
            i++;
        } else if (A[i][j] == A[i][j + 1]) {
            j++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    // Check if the matrix is yin-yang.
    bool is_yin_yang = true;
    for (int i = 1; i < N && is_yin_yang; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < M && is_yin_yang; ++j) {
            if (A[i][j] < A[i - 1][j] || A[i][j] < A[i][j - 1]) {
                is_yin_yang = false;
            }
        }
    }

    if (is_yin_yang) {
        fout << operations << '\n';
    } else {
        fout << "-1\n";
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses a greedy algorithm to bring the largest elements to the top-left corner and iterates through the matrix. After performing all possible swaps, it checks if the matrix is yin-yang and writes the number of operations to `yinyang.out`. If the matrix cannot be made yin-yang, it writes `-1`. This solution should work for the given problem constraints.

The output discrepancy arises because the previous solutions attempted to directly sort or swap elements in the matrix without considering the necessary conditions for converting it into a yin-yang matrix using the minimal number of operations. In the case of the given example, no operations are needed since the matrix is already yin-yang. The solutions failed to identify this and instead performed unnecessary checks or swaps leading to incorrect conclusions.

We need a valid strategy to determine the minimum number of swaps necessary to transform the given matrix into a yin-yang matrix. However, due to the complexity of possible row and column swaps, finding an efficient and correct algorithm is not straightforward. An exhaustive search is not feasible due to the combinatorial explosion of possibilities.

Given the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix (up to 100x100), an algorithm that explores the problem space with a better strategy is required. A correct approach would likely involve carefully analyzing the relationships between elements and how row and column swaps affect the overall order.

Here is a corrected solution that first checks if the matrix is already yin-yang and, if not, attempts to find the minimum number of swaps required. This solution assumes that if the largest number in the matrix is not in the first row or column, the matrix cannot be sorted into a yin-yang matrix. It then proceeds to check for possible row and column swaps:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

bool is_yin_yang(const std::vector<std::vector<int>> &matrix) {
    int N = matrix.size(), M = matrix[0].size();
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < M; ++j) {
            if (matrix[i][j] < matrix[i - 1][j] || matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j - 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    int N, M;
    fin >> N >> M;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A(N, std::vector<int>(M));

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            fin >> A[i][j];
        }
    }

    if (is_yin_yang(A)) {
        fout << 0 << '\n';
        fout.close();
        return 0;
    }

    // Check if the largest element is not in the first row or column.
    int max_element = A[0][0];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j)
            max_element = std::max(max_element, A[i][j]);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i)
        if (A[i][0] == max_element) {
            fout << "-1\n";
            fout.close();
            return 0;
        }

    for (int j = 1; j < M; ++j)
        if (A[0][j] == max_element) {
            fout << "-1\n";
            fout.close();
            return 0;
        }

    // The problem requires a more complex algorithm to count swaps.
    fout << "-1\n"; // Placeholder for the actual swap counting logic

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this updated code, we first check if the matrix is already yin-yang. If it is not, we check if the largest element is not in the first row or column, in which case we output `-1`. If the largest element is in the first row or column, then theoretically, there should be a sequence of swaps that arranges the matrix into a yin-yang form. However, determining the minimal sequence of swaps for an arbitrary matrix is a complex problem that may require a more sophisticated algorithm than can be reasonably provided here.

For now, the updated code correctly identifies the given input as already being a yin-yang matrix and outputs `0`. Further development of an algorithm to count the minimal swaps for arbitrary matrices would likely involve a detailed analysis of the matrix patterns and properties specific to yin-yang matrices.

The differences between the expected result and the found result in the last implementation occur because the code is not actually calculating the number of swaps needed to make the matrix yin-yang. It only checks whether the matrix is already yin-yang or whether it's impossible to make it yin-yang based on the position of the largest element.

The correct approach to solving this problem would involve a thorough understanding of the matrix's structure and the explicit steps required to sort it into a yin-yang configuration. The problem statement implies that it's always possible to sort a matrix into a yin-yang form unless there are duplicates of the largest number outside of the first row and column, which makes sorting impossible.

To calculate the minimum number of swaps, we can employ a strategy based on the following observations:

1. The largest number in the matrix must end up in the bottom-right corner.
2. If there are duplicates of the largest number, they must all be either in the last row or in the last column.
3. We need to move the largest numbers to the last row and the last column using swaps.
4. Each swap can move a number to an adjacent position.

Here is the pseudocode for a possible solution:

1. Find the largest number in the matrix.
2. Check for duplicates of the largest number and their positions.
3. If any duplicates are outside of the last row and the last column, return -1.
4. Otherwise, count the number of swaps required to get all largest numbers to the last row and column.
5. Iterate over each row and column, swapping elements to sort the matrix into a yin-yang form.

Now, let's convert this into a solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>
#include <algorithm>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int main() {
    int N, M;
    fin >> N >> M;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A(N, std::vector<int>(M));
    int max_num = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            fin >> A[i][j];
            max_num = std::max(max_num, A[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Count how many times the max number appears and where
    int max_count = 0;
    std::vector<int> max_rows, max_cols;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            if (A[i][j] == max_num) {
                max_count++;
                max_rows.push_back(i);
                max_cols.push_back(j);
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if max numbers are not exclusively in last row or column (impossible to sort)
    for (int i = 0; i < max_rows.size(); ++i) {
        if (max_rows[i] != N - 1 && max_cols[i] != M - 1) {
            fout << -1 << '\n';
            fout.close();
            return 0;
        }
    }

    // Calculate swaps needed to move max numbers to the bottom-right corner
    int swaps = 0;
    std::sort(max_rows.begin(), max_rows.end());
    std::sort(max_cols.begin(), max_cols.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < max_rows.size(); ++i) {
        swaps += N - 1 - max_rows[i];
        swaps += M - 1 - max_cols[i];
    }

    // Unique max numbers can be moved without additional swaps
    swaps -= (std::unique(max_rows.begin(), max_rows.end()) - max_rows.begin());
    swaps -= (std::unique(max_cols.begin(), max_cols.end()) - max_cols.begin());

    fout << swaps << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code calculates the number of swaps required based on the position of the largest number in the matrix and its duplicates. It first checks if the matrix can be made yin-yang (i.e., if the largest number and its duplicates can be moved to the last row and column). If so, it counts the number of swaps needed to move these numbers to the bottom-right corner. The code then writes the result to `yinyang.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected result and the output of the provided solution occurs because the solution incorrectly calculates the number of swaps, including deductions for unique maximum numbers, which results in a negative count under certain conditions. Additionally, the solution does not correctly check for the yin-yang condition before making these calculations.

To fix the solution, we should:

1. Check if the matrix is already yin-yang and return `0` if it is.
2. Find the positions of all instances of the maximum number.
3. Determine if it's possible to move all instances of the maximum number to the last row and column.
4. If it's possible, calculate the number of swaps required to move the instances of the maximum number to the corner formed by the last row and column.
5. Avoid deducting unique positions, as it does not reflect the problem's requirement correctly.

Let's correct the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

bool check_yin_yang(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
    int N = matrix.size(), M = matrix[0].size();
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < M; ++j) {
            if (matrix[i][j] < matrix[i - 1][j] || matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j - 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    int N, M;
    fin >> N >> M;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A(N, std::vector<int>(M));
    int max_val = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            fin >> A[i][j];
            max_val = std::max(max_val, A[i][j]);
        }
    }

    if (check_yin_yang(A)) {
        fout << 0 << '\n';
        fout.close();
        return 0;
    }

    // Count swaps required to get all instances of the max number to the bottom-right corner
    int swaps = 0, last_row = N - 1, last_col = M - 1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            if (A[i][j] == max_val) {
                // If a max_val is not already in the last row or column, add swaps needed
                if (i != last_row) swaps += (last_row - i);
                if (j != last_col) swaps += (last_col - j);
                // Once a max_val is moved to the last row or column, decrement it
                // as it becomes the new last row or column
                if (i != last_row) last_row--;
                if (j != last_col) last_col--;
            }
        }
    }

    fout << swaps << '\n';
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution first checks if the matrix is already in yin-yang order. If not, it calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to get all instances of the maximum value to the bottom-right corner. It ensures that the result can never be negative, as we only add the number of swaps when a maximum value is not in the last row or column, and then we decrease the last row or column index accordingly. This way, we avoid double-counting swaps for instances already in the correct row or column.

Upon the analysis of the results, it's clear that the previous solution's logic for counting the swaps is flawed because it miscounts when the largest values are in the last row and column. The solution should be able to handle cases where multiple largest values are present and calculate the minimum swaps required for the entire matrix to become yin-yang, rather than just focusing on the largest values.

The test case provided is an example where the previous logic fails. The matrix:

```
6 6 5
4 6 2
```

can be transformed into a yin-yang matrix with three operations:

1. Swap the first and second rows.
2. Swap the second and third columns.
3. Swap the first and second rows again.

Let's write a new solution that correctly counts the swaps required to transform the matrix into a yin-yang matrix:

1. Check if the matrix is already yin-yang.
2. Find the largest value in the matrix.
3. If there are multiple instances of the largest value, check if they are all in the last row or column.
4. If not, we cannot transform the matrix to yin-yang, return -1.
5. Otherwise, count the number of swaps required for each element to place it in sorted order, considering the yin-yang constraints.

Here's the new solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::ifstream fin("yinyang.in");
std::ofstream fout("yinyang.out");

int main() {
    int N, M;
    fin >> N >> M;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(N, std::vector<int>(M));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j)
            fin >> matrix[i][j];

    // Check if the matrix is already yin-yang
    auto is_yin_yang = [&matrix]() {
        for (int i = 1; i < matrix.size(); ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j < matrix[0].size(); ++j)
                if (matrix[i][j] < matrix[i - 1][j] || matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j - 1])
                    return false;
        return true;
    };

    if (is_yin_yang()) {
        fout << 0 << std::endl;
        fout.close();
        return 0;
    }

    // Find the largest value in the matrix and its occurrences
    int max_value = 0;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> max_positions; // pairs of (row, column)
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            if (matrix[i][j] > max_value) {
                max_value = matrix[i][j];
                max_positions.clear();
                max_positions.emplace_back(i, j);
            } else if (matrix[i][j] == max_value) {
                max_positions.emplace_back(i, j);
            }
        }
    }

    // Count the swaps required to form a yin-yang matrix
    int swaps = 0;
    bool possible = true;
    for (const auto& pos : max_positions) {
        // If the maximum value is not in the last row or column, it's impossible to sort
        if (pos.first != N - 1 && pos.second != M - 1) {
            possible = false;
            break;
        }
        // Count swaps needed to bring the maximum value to the bottom-right corner
        if (pos.first != N - 1) swaps += N - 1 - pos.first;
        if (pos.second != M - 1) swaps += M - 1 - pos.second;
    }

    if (possible) {
        fout << swaps << std::endl;
    } else {
        fout << -1 << std::endl;
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This new solution first checks if the matrix is already yin-yang and, if it is, outputs `0`. Otherwise, it counts the number of swaps needed to bring the maximum values to the bottom-right corner while satisfying the yin-yang constraints. If it's not possible to make the matrix yin-yang, it outputs `-1`. If possible, it outputs the total number of swaps calculated.
