Nicușor este elev în clasa a VI-a și s-a gândit că este suficient de mare ca să inventeze un joc nou. Are doar o foaie de hârtie și un pix. Scrie mai întâi $n$ numere naturale în cerc. Acestea formează ***Ruleta numerelor***. Jocul se desfășoară după următoarele reguli:

* se parcurge șirul numerelor în sensul deplasării acelor de ceasornic;
* se pornește de fiecare dată de la același element;
* se execută de fiecare dată o rotație completă;
* fiecare element nenul se scade din elementul imediat următor doar dacă este mai mic sau egal cu acesta și nenul;

**Exemplu.** Dacă notăm cu $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5, R_6, R_7, R8$ șirul numerelor ce formează ruleta din figura $1$, atunci, o rotație completă realizează următoarele modificări asupra numerelor din listă:

~[ruleta1.png|width=35em] ~[ruleta2.png|width=23em]

* ruleta se oprește atunci când execută o rotație completă și nu se modifică nici o valoare din șirul elementelor.

**Exemplu.** Pentru ruleta din figura $1$ se execută $4$ rotații (dintre care $3$ în care se fac modificări):

~[ruleta3.png]

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine, pentru un șir de $n$ numere naturale care indică starea inițială a ruletei, numărul $r$ de rotații complete efectuate respectând regulile jocului până la încheierea acestuia și numărul $t$ al elementelor nenule aflate în șir la încheierea jocului.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ruleta.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $n$ de numere naturale așezate în cerc iar pe linia a doua, separate prin câte un spațiu, cele $n$ valori, în ordinea deplasării, începând cu elementul de la care pornește ruleta.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ruleta.out` conține pe prima linie, separate printr-un spațiu, valorile $r$ și $t$ (în această ordine).

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Numerele de pe ruletă sunt numere naturale mai mici sau cel mult egale cu $30 \ 000$.
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $r$ de rotaţii se acordă 70% din punctajul pe test; punctajul integral se acordă dacă ambele valori afişate sunt corecte.

The issue in the provided code is that it counts the last rotation where no changes occur, which should not be counted as per the problem statement. The logic of the `do...while` loop should be modified to check for changes at the end of each rotation, and only increment the count `r` if there has been at least one change during the rotation. Also, the counting for the rotations seems to be off by one.

Let's fix the code block to address these issues and provide the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ruleta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ruleta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    int* ruleta = new int[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> ruleta[i];
    }

    int r = 0, t = 0, changes;
    bool modified;

    do {
        modified = false;
        changes = ruleta[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (changes != 0 && changes <= ruleta[i]) {
                ruleta[i] -= changes;
                modified = true;
            }
            changes = ruleta[i];
        }
        if (ruleta[0] >= changes && changes != 0) {
            ruleta[0] -= changes;
            modified = true;
        }
        if (modified) r++;
    } while (modified);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (ruleta[i] != 0) t++;
    }

    delete[] ruleta;

    fout << r << " " << t << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, we only increment the counter `r` if a modification has been made during the rotation (`modified` is `true`). Moreover, we have added a condition at the end of the loop to handle the subtraction of the last element from the first one, which was missing in the initial implementation. We now also check if the first element should be decremented by the last element and mark the `modified` flag accordingly.

This solution should now produce the correct output for the given input.

The issue with the previous code is that it did not handle the subtraction of the last element from the first element correctly, which resulted in an incorrect count of rotations. Additionally, the check to decrement the first element by the last element was not placed correctly in the loop, which did not reflect the cyclic nature of the problem.

Let's address these issues with a corrected version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ruleta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ruleta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> ruleta(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> ruleta[i];
    }

    int r = 0, t = 0;
    bool modified;

    do {
        modified = false;
        // Start with the last element as it will be used to possibly subtract from the first.
        int prev = ruleta[n - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Check if we can subtract prev from the current element.
            if (prev != 0 && prev <= ruleta[i]) {
                ruleta[i] -= prev;
                modified = true;
            }
            // Update prev to the current element after potential subtraction.
            prev = ruleta[i];
        }
        // Increment rotation count only if a modification was made.
        if (modified) {
            r++;
        }
    } while (modified);

    // Count the non-zero elements in the final state.
    for (int val : ruleta) {
        if (val != 0) t++;
    }

    fout << r << " " << t << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This updated version correctly handles the cyclic subtraction by ensuring that the last element's value is checked against the first element at the end of each cycle, and increases the rotation count only if a modification has been made during that cycle. The variable `modified` is used to track whether changes have occurred, and the rotation count `r` is only incremented if `modified` is `true` at the end of a cycle. The final count of non-zero elements for `t` should now also be correct.

Upon reviewing the previous code and the problem statement, it is clear that the logic for counting the number of non-zero elements (`t`) after the final rotation is incorrect. The previous code attempts to count the non-zero elements after all rotations have been completed, but it fails to account for the possibility that the last element can become zero due to subtraction in the final rotation. This is why the expected output for `t` is `3`, but the output from the code is `4`.

Let's correct the solution by incorporating the check for non-zero elements during the rotation process, and updating the count of non-zero elements at the same time:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ruleta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ruleta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> ruleta(n);
    std::vector<bool> nonzero(n, true); // Keep track of which elements are non-zero

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> ruleta[i];
        if (ruleta[i] == 0) nonzero[i] = false; // Initialize the non-zero status
    }

    int r = 0, t = n; // Start with t being equal to n, as all elements are initially non-zero
    bool modified;

    do {
        modified = false;
        int prev = ruleta[n - 1], current;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            current = ruleta[i];
            if (prev != 0 && prev <= current) {
                ruleta[i] -= prev;
                modified = true;
                if (ruleta[i] == 0) { // If the current element becomes zero, decrease t
                    nonzero[i] = false;
                    t--;
                }
            }
            prev = current;
        }
        if (modified) r++;
    } while (modified);

    fout << r << " " << t << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this fixed solution, we maintain an additional vector `nonzero` to track the non-zero status of each element. When an element becomes zero after subtraction, we mark it as such in the `nonzero` vector and decrement `t`. Now, `t` correctly represents the number of non-zero elements after each rotation, and the solution should match the expected output.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and ensure we fix the issue with the code.

The algorithm needs to simulate the process of Nicușor's game by continuously rotating through the numbers and performing subtractions according to the rules until a full rotation occurs without any changes. After fixing the code, we should expect `r` to be `4` and `t` to be `3` as per the example.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ruleta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ruleta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> ruleta(n);

    // Read the numbers into the ruleta vector.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> ruleta[i];
    }

    int r = 0; // Number of complete rotations.
    bool changed; // Flag to indicate if any subtraction has occurred.

    do {
        changed = false;
        // Perform one complete rotation.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int nextIndex = (i + 1) % n; // Next index in a circular manner.
            // Subtract ruleta[i] from ruleta[nextIndex] if the conditions are met.
            if (ruleta[i] != 0 && ruleta[i] <= ruleta[nextIndex]) {
                ruleta[nextIndex] -= ruleta[i];
                changed = true; // Mark that a change has occurred.
            }
        }
        // Increase the rotation count if changes occurred in this rotation.
        if (changed) {
            r++;
        }
    } while (changed);

    // Count the number of non-zero elements left in ruleta.
    int t = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (ruleta[i] != 0) {
            t++;
        }
    }

    // Write the result to the output file.
    fout << r << " " << t << std::endl;

    // Close the files.
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This fixed version correctly handles the cyclic nature of the problem, by using modulo arithmetic to ensure that the rotation wraps around to the start of the array when reaching the end. The `changed` flag is used to track whether any subtractions occurred during a rotation, and the count of rotations (`r`) is only incremented if a change did occur.

This solution should now provide the correct output, which is 4 rotations and 3 non-zero numbers remaining at the end.

The issue with the previous code submissions is not accurately counting the final rotation where no changes are made. According to the problem statement, the game ends after a complete rotation where no changes occur, which means that the last rotation where no changes occur should still be counted. 

Let's fix the solution. We need to ensure we correctly count the rotations, including the final rotation with no changes. Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ruleta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ruleta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> ruleta(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> ruleta[i];
    }

    int r = 0, t = 0;
    bool changed;

    do {
        changed = false;
        int prev = ruleta[n - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (prev != 0 && prev <= ruleta[i]) {
                ruleta[i] -= prev;
                changed = true;
            }
            prev = ruleta[i];
        }
        r++;  // Increment rotations after each completed cycle
    } while (changed);  // Continue while changes are made

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (ruleta[i] != 0) {
            t++;
        }
    }

    fout << r << " " << t << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution correctly increments the rotation count `r` after every completed cycle, including the one where no changes occur. The `changed` flag is used to determine whether another rotation should be started. The count of non-zero elements `t` is calculated after the loop finishes, which corresponds to the state of the ruleta when no more changes occur. This should give the correct output as per the problem statement.

I apologize for the confusion. The issue with the previously provided codes is that they are including an extra rotation in the count `r`. According to the problem requirements, the rotation count should only be incremented if a change has occurred during that rotation. Additionally, the last rotation where no changes occur should not be counted, which contradicts the statement in the previous explanation.

The count of non-zero elements `t` seems to be calculated correctly, so we need to make sure that we do not increment `r` after the last rotation where no changes occur.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ruleta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ruleta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> ruleta(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> ruleta[i];
    }

    int r = 0, t = 0;
    bool changed;

    do {
        changed = false;
        int prev = ruleta[n - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (prev != 0 && prev <= ruleta[i]) {
                ruleta[i] -= prev;
                changed = true;
            }
            prev = ruleta[i];
        }
        if (changed) r++;  // Increment rotations only if a change occurred
    } while (changed);  // Continue while changes are made

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (ruleta[i] != 0) {
            t++;  // Count the non-zero elements
        }
    }

    fout << r << " " << t << "\n";  // Write the final count of rotations and non-zero elements

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should now provide the correct output as per the problem statement. The rotation count `r` is only incremented inside the loop if a change has occurred (`changed` is true). The count of non-zero elements `t` is calculated after the loop finishes, which corresponds to the final state of the ruleta.
