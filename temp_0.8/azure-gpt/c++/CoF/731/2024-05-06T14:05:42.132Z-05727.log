Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

```

This code reads from `popas.in`, processes the input according to the described problem, and writes the result to `popas.out`. It uses file streams for I/O operations instead of standard input/output, which is much faster. The code also implements the logic to determine which trail needs the minimum number of stops to fill the thermos. It incorporates the constraints directly into the trail processing loop to avoid extra checks. If no solution is possible, the number `1000` (higher than any possible number of stops given the constraints) is used as an indicator, and the output will be `0`.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, I identified a mistake. The reading of `t` and `u` should be done before processing the trails, as they are used during the computation. Let's fix this and update the algorithm accordingly.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");
    
    int k, r, d, t, u, trail_id, min_stops = 1000, selected_trail = 0;
    fin >> k;

    std::vector<int> springs(22); // 20 springs max + start and end
    fin >> t >> u; // Read t and u before processing trails

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trail_id >> r;
        // First "spring" is the start point
        springs[0] = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= r; ++j) {
            fin >> springs[j];
        }
        // Last "spring" is one km before the peak
        springs[r + 1] = 361; // 360 + 1 because the peak is 1 km after the last spring

        // Sort springs to ensure they are in order from start to peak
        std::sort(springs.begin(), springs.begin() + r + 2);

        int stops = 0, last_fill = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= r + 1; ++j) {
            if (springs[j] - springs[last_fill] > t) {
                if (springs[j - 1] == springs[last_fill] || springs[j] - springs[j - 1] > u) {
                    // No solution possible
                    stops = 1000;
                    break;
                }
                last_fill = j - 1;
                stops++;
            }
        }

        // To handle the last segment to the peak, if the last fill-in point is too far from the peak
        if (stops != 1000 && 360 - springs[last_fill] > t) {
            if (360 - springs[r] > u) {
                // No solution possible
                stops = 1000;
            } else {
                // One last stop is required
                stops++;
            }
        }

        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && trail_id > selected_trail)) { // Choose the last trail in case of a tie
            min_stops = stops;
            selected_trail = trail_id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == 1000) {
        fout << "0\n";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << ' ' << selected_trail << '\n';
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, the reading of `t` and `u` has been moved prior to the loop where we process each trail's information. Additionally, when comparing stops, we now select the trail that is listed last in the case of a tie by checking if `trail_id` is greater than the currently `selected_trail`. Finally, the checks for the last segment to the peak have been corrected to compare against `360` instead of `361` since the peak is considered to be 1 km after the last recorded spring.

It seems that the previous correction still didn't yield the expected output. After closely examining the code and the input data, I realize that the logic for deciding whether a stop is needed is not correctly implemented. The condition checks need to account for the full range of `t` - the distance for which the water is sufficient.

Let's fix the solution by recalculating whether a stop is necessary based on the distance `t` and the remaining distance `u` that can be traveled without water. We will also ensure that the logic correctly handles the case where multiple trails have the same minimum number of stops, in which case we should choose the trail that comes last in the input file.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");
    
    int k, r, d, t, u, trail_id, min_stops = 1000, selected_trail = -1;
    fin >> k;
    std::vector<int> springs;

    fin >> t >> u; // Read t and u before processing trails

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trail_id >> r;
        springs.clear();
        springs.push_back(0); // Start point
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            fin >> d;
            springs.push_back(d);
        }

        // Insert a fictitious spring at the peak, which is 1 km after the last spring
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1);

        int stops = 0;
        int distance_covered_with_water = t;

        for (int j = 1; j < springs.size(); ++j) {
            if (springs[j] > distance_covered_with_water) {
                int prev_spring = springs[j - 1];

                if (prev_spring + u < springs[j]) {
                    // Can't reach the next spring without water
                    stops = 1000; // Set to an invalid high number
                    break;
                }

                distance_covered_with_water = prev_spring + t;
                ++stops;
            }
        }

        if (stops <= min_stops) {
            if (stops < min_stops || trail_id > selected_trail) {
                min_stops = stops;
                selected_trail = trail_id;
            }
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == 1000 || selected_trail == -1) {
        fout << "0\n";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << ' ' << selected_trail << '\n';
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we've changed the way we initialize and manage the `springs` vector, avoiding sorting as the input is expected to be ordered. We've also adjusted the main loop to check if we can reach the next spring with the remaining water (taking into account the distance `t` that can be covered with water and the emergency distance `u` that can be traveled without water). If a stop is not possible, we set `stops` to an invalid high number (`1000`). We also update the minimum number of stops and the selected trail correctly now, ensuring that we handle ties by choosing the last trail in the input.

Thank you for your patience. I apologize for the confusion. Let's evaluate the problem again and correct the solution.

The previous correction still did not produce the expected result because the logic to decide the number of stops is not considering the constraints correctly. In particular, the last spring is not necessarily 1 km before the peak, but the distance from the last spring to the peak is 1 km. We also need to carefully update the selected trail only if we find a trail with fewer stops or if it has the same number of stops but a higher trail ID (the latest trail).

Let's correct the solution as follows:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");
    
    int k, r, t, u, trail_id;
    fin >> k;

    std::vector<int> distances;
    int min_stops = 1000, selected_trail = -1;
    
    fin >> t >> u; // Read t and u before processing trails

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trail_id >> r;
        distances.clear();
        distances.resize(r + 1);
        
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            fin >> distances[j];
        }
        // The peak is 1 km after the last spring
        distances[r] = 360; // last spring distance to peak
        
        int stops = 0;
        int last_fill = 0;
        
        for (int j = 1; j <= r; ++j) {
            if (distances[j] - distances[last_fill] > t) {
                // Need to fill at the previous spring
                last_fill = j - 1;
                stops++;
                // Check if we can reach the next spring after filling
                if (distances[j] - distances[last_fill] > t) {
                    // Can't reach the next spring, so this trail is not possible
                    stops = 1000;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        // Check if we can reach the peak from the last spring without a fill
        if (distances[r] - distances[last_fill] > t) {
            // Need one more stop at the last spring
            if (distances[r] - distances[r - 1] <= u) {
                // We're okay if the last spring to peak is within the 'u' range
                stops++;
            } else {
                // Can't reach the peak from the last spring without water
                stops = 1000;
            }
        }
        
        // Update the selected trail if the current trail is better
        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && trail_id > selected_trail)) {
            min_stops = stops;
            selected_trail = trail_id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == 1000) {
        fout << "0\n";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << ' ' << selected_trail << '\n';
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, we read `t` and `u` from the input file before processing each trail. For each trail, we then read the distances of the springs and add the peak as 360 km from the start. We then iterate over these distances and determine where to make stops, ensuring the trail is viable given the constraints `t` and `u`. The output is written to `popas.out` and should match the expected output.

Let's correct the solution by ensuring we properly determine the minimum number of stops required and handle the case when there are multiple trails with the same number of stops. We should choose the trail that appears last in the input file.

In this corrected solution, the program reads the trail information and processes each trail's springs to determine the number of stops needed. It ensures that the trail is valid and that the selected trail is the one with the minimum number of stops or, if tied, the one that appears last in the input. The last spring is at a distance of 360, and the peak is at 361 to act as a sentinel value. If a valid trail is found, the program writes the minimum number of stops and the selected trail ID to `popas.out`. If no valid trail is found, it writes "0". This solution should now provide the correct output as expected.

Upon further review, it seems that we've been approaching the problem correctly, but there might be an issue in how we're updating the `last_fill` variable and determining the validity of reaching the peak.

The last spring should not be set at 361, but we should instead check the distance from the last natural spring to the peak, which has a fixed value of 1 km. If the distance from the last fill to the last natural spring plus the fixed 1 km to the peak is greater than the thermos capacity `t`, but less than or equal to `t+u`, then the climber can still make it by using the reserve `u` after the thermos water runs out.

Let's fix the code with these considerations:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");
    
    int k, r, d, t, u, trail_id;
    fin >> k;
    std::vector<int> springs(22); // Maximum 20 springs + start and peak

    // Read t and u before processing trails
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int selected_trail = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trail_id >> r;
        
        for (int j = 1; j <= r; ++j) {
            fin >> springs[j];
        }
        springs[0] = 0; // Starting point
        springs[r + 1] = 360; // Distance to the last spring (peak is 1 km after this)
        
        int stops = 0;
        int current_position = 0;

        for (int j = 1; j <= r + 1; ++j) {
            if (springs[j] - current_position > t) {
                // Need to refill at the previous spring
                current_position = springs[j - 1];
                stops++;
            }
        }

        // Check if we can reach the peak from the last spring without another stop
        if (360 - current_position > t) {
            if (360 - current_position <= t + u) {
                // Peak can be reached with the reserve
                stops++;
            } else {
                // Peak cannot be reached, this path is not valid
                stops = INT_MAX;
            }
        }

        // Choose the path with the minimum stops, or the last path if there is a tie
        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && trail_id > selected_trail)) {
            min_stops = stops;
            selected_trail = trail_id;
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0\n";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << selected_trail << "\n";
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we first read the total number of trails `k`, and the capacities `t` and `u`. For each trail, we read the spring positions and calculate the number of stops needed. If the peak can be reached from the last refill point with the reserve `u`, we increase the stop count. Otherwise, we set the stops to `INT_MAX` to indicate it's not a valid path. We select the trail with the least number of stops or, if there is a tie, the trail that appears last in the input. If no solution is found, we write "0" to `popas.out`; otherwise, we write the number of stops and the selected trail ID.

The error message indicates that `INT_MAX` is not declared. This is because the header `<climits>` which defines the macro `INT_MAX` has not been included in the program.

To fix the compilation error, we should include the header `<climits>`. Here's the revised program with the necessary fix:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits> // Include for INT_MAX

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");
    
    int k, r, d, t, u, trail_id;
    fin >> k;
    std::vector<int> springs(22); // Maximum 20 springs + start and peak

    // Read t and u before processing trails
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int selected_trail = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trail_id >> r;
        
        for (int j = 1; j <= r; ++j) {
            fin >> springs[j];
        }
        springs[0] = 0; // Starting point
        springs[r + 1] = 360; // Distance to the last spring (peak is 1 km after this)
        
        int stops = 0;
        int current_position = 0;

        for (int j = 1; j <= r + 1; ++j) {
            if (springs[j] - current_position > t) {
                // Need to refill at the previous spring
                current_position = springs[j - 1];
                stops++;
            }
        }

        // Check if we can reach the peak from the last spring without another stop
        if (360 - current_position > t) {
            if (360 - current_position <= t + u) {
                // Peak can be reached with the reserve
                stops++;
            } else {
                // Peak cannot be reached, this path is not valid
                stops = INT_MAX;
            }
        }

        // Choose the path with the minimum stops, or the last path if there is a tie
        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && trail_id > selected_trail)) {
            min_stops = stops;
            selected_trail = trail_id;
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0\n";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << selected_trail << "\n";
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

With the inclusion of `<climits>`, `INT_MAX` is now defined, and the program should compile without errors. This version should correctly find the trail with the minimum number of stops required to reach the peak and, in the case of ties, it should select the last trail from the input file.
