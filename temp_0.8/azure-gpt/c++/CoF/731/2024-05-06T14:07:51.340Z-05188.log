Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

I apologize for the oversight. Upon reviewing the previous code, the main issue is that I incorrectly placed the input reading for `t` and `u` at the end of the file processing, which should have been read before processing traseu (paths). Moreover, the logic for checking the popasuri (stops) and updating the selected path is incorrect.

Let's first correct the logic:

1. We need to read `t` and `u` after reading `k` and before processing each path.
2. We must ensure that the water lasts until the next source or until the end of the path.
3. We must account for the fact that the path chosen should be the last one in the input file in case of ties for the number of minimum popasuri.
4. We have to check if the distance between sources is greater than `t`.
5. It is important to correctly evaluate when a popas is needed based on the remaining water (the distance that the hiker can cover with the water in the termos, which is `t` kilometers) and the distance to the next water source or to the peak.

Here is a revised version of the solution following these rules:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("popas.in");
    std::ofstream out("popas.out");

    int k, r, d, t, u;
    in >> k;

    // Read t and u before processing each traseu
    in >> t >> u;

    int min_popasuri = 1000, traseu_ales = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        in >> r;
        int ultimul_popas = 0, popasuri = 0, distanta_precedenta = 0;
        bool traseu_valid = true;

        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            in >> d;
            if (d - distanta_precedenta > t) {
                if (distanta_precedenta - ultimul_popas < t) {
                    ultimul_popas = distanta_precedenta;
                    popasuri++;
                } else {
                    traseu_valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            distanta_precedenta = d;
        }
        if (traseu_valid && 360 - ultimul_popas <= t) {
            if (popasuri < min_popasuri || (popasuri == min_popasuri && i > traseu_ales)) {
                min_popasuri = popasuri;
                traseu_ales = i + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    if (min_popasuri == 1000) {
        out << "0";
    } else {
        out << min_popasuri << " " << traseu_ales;
    }

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the number of paths (`k`), then reads the distances `t` (water sufficiency) and `u` (distance without water), and processes each path individually. It keeps track of the last water fill (`ultimul_popas`) and the number of stops (`popasuri`). If at any point the hiker cannot reach the next source or the peak with the water left, the path becomes invalid. The code keeps track of the path with the minimum number of stops, favoring the last one in case of ties.

After evaluating the previous solution and the given input data, I realize there was a mistake in the calculation of the number of popasuri (stops) required. The logic to determine when to make a stop did not correctly calculate the distances between the sources and did not handle the case when the last source is not within the `t` distance to the summit. Additionally, I overlooked that `r` was the number of sources, not the identifier for the trail, so I need to ensure we use the trail count `i` as the identifier.

Let's fix the logic to better reflect the problem statement:

1. We need to make sure that the trail is valid if we can go from each source to the next one or from the last source to the peak without running out of water. This means checking if the distance to the next source or to the peak is less than or equal to `t`.
2. We should consider the distance between sources and the distance from the last source to the peak.
3. We need to update the number of minimum stops and selected trail correctly, taking into account the distance `u` that the hiker can travel without water.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("popas.in");
    std::ofstream out("popas.out");

    int k, r, d, t, u;
    in >> k;

    // Read t and u before processing each traseu.
    in >> t >> u;

    int min_popasuri = 1000, traseu_ales = 0, current_path;

    for (int path = 0; path < k; ++path) {
        in >> current_path >> r;
        std::vector<int> sources(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            in >> sources[j];
        }
        sources.push_back(360); // Add the peak as the last "source".

        int popasuri = 0, last_popas = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < sources.size(); ++j) {
            // Check if we can reach the next source or the peak.
            if (j == 0 || sources[j] - last_popas <= t) {
                // If we can't reach the next source from the current source, make a stop.
                if (j < sources.size() - 1 && sources[j + 1] - last_popas > t) {
                    last_popas = sources[j];
                    popasuri++;
                }
            } else {
                popasuri = 1001; // Invalid path, cannot reach the next source with the water left.
                break;
            }
        }

        if (popasuri <= min_popasuri) {
            if (popasuri < min_popasuri || path > traseu_ales) {
                min_popasuri = popasuri;
                traseu_ales = current_path;
            }
        }
    }

    if (min_popasuri * t > u) {
        out << "0";
    } else {
        out << min_popasuri << " " << traseu_ales;
    }

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly identify the path with the minimum number of popasuri, taking into consideration that the hiker can travel `u` distance without water after the last stop. The path with the least number of required stops (or the last such path in case of a tie) will be chosen.

It seems my previous attempts failed to address all the requirements of the problem correctly. I apologize for the confusion and will now attempt to address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that we read `k`, `t`, and `u` correctly.
2. Properly calculating when to make a stop, based on whether we can reach the next source or the peak with the water we have.
3. Considering the distance `u` that the hiker can travel without water when deciding if a path is valid.
4. Keeping track of the last path that meets the minimum number of stops requirement.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("popas.in");
    std::ofstream out("popas.out");

    int k, r, t, u, min_popasuri = 1000, traseu_ales = 0;
    in >> k >> t >> u;

    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
        in >> r;
        int popasuri = 0, last_source = 0;
        bool is_valid = true;

        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            int d;
            in >> d;
            if (d - last_source > t) {
                // If we cannot reach the current source from the last stop, increment popasuri.
                if (j == 0 || d - last_source - t > u) {
                    // If even with the extra distance `u` we cannot reach the source, mark as invalid.
                    is_valid = false;
                    break;
                }
                popasuri++;
                last_source = d;
            }
        }

        if (is_valid && 360 - last_source > t) {
            // If we cannot reach the peak from the last stop, increment popasuri.
            if (360 - last_source - t > u) {
                // If even with the extra distance `u` we cannot reach the peak, mark as invalid.
                is_valid = false;
            } else {
                popasuri++;
            }
        }

        // If the path is valid and has equal or fewer stops than the current minimum, update min_popasuri.
        if (is_valid && popasuri <= min_popasuri) {
            min_popasuri = popasuri;
            traseu_ales = i; // Use `i` as the trail identifier, not `r`.
        }
    }

    if (min_popasuri == 1000) {
        out << "0"; // If no valid path was found, output 0.
    } else {
        out << min_popasuri << " " << traseu_ales;
    }

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly determine the optimal path with the least number of stops required to reach the peak, considering the extra distance `u` the hiker can travel without water. It will output "0" only if no valid path exists.

The previous implementations misunderstood the problem requirements and, as a result, produced the wrong output. Let's re-evaluate the challenge and implement the solution step by step:

The objective is to find the path with the minimum number of stops needed to refill the water, with the constraint that the distance `t` is the maximum the hiker can travel with a full water supply and `u` is the maximum distance they can travel without water.

The main steps are:
1. Read the total number of paths `k`.
2. Read the maximum distance `t` the hiker can travel with water and `u` without water.
3. For each path, read the number of sources and their distances, then determine the number of stops needed.
4. Track the path with the minimum number of stops, favoring the path that comes last in case of a tie.
5. Write the result to the output file.

Now, let's implement the solution correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("popas.in");
    std::ofstream out("popas.out");

    int k, t, u, numar_traseu, r, di;
    in >> k >> t >> u;

    int min_popasuri = k + 1; // Start with a large number of stops, more than the maximum possible.
    int traseu_ales = 0;

    // Iterate over all paths.
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
        in >> numar_traseu >> r;

        int previous_stop = 0; // Start from the beginning.
        int popasuri = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            in >> di;

            // Determine if we need to make a stop at the current source.
            if (di - previous_stop > t) {
                // Make a stop at the previous source.
                previous_stop = di;
                popasuri += 1;
            }
        }

        // Add a stop if we cannot reach the peak without refilling.
        if (360 - previous_stop > t) {
            popasuri += 1;
        }

        // Update the path with fewer stops or the last one in case of a tie.
        if (popasuri <= min_popasuri) {
            min_popasuri = popasuri;
            traseu_ales = numar_traseu;
        }
    }

    // Output the result.
    if (min_popasuri > k) {
        // No solution found.
        out << "0";
    } else {
        out << min_popasuri << " " << traseu_ales;
    }

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly handle the problem's requirements and produce the expected result. It reads the input data, processes each path to determine the number of stops required, and then writes the correct output to the file `popas.out`.

It seems there was another mistake in the previous code. Specifically, the check for whether the hiker needs to make a popas (stop) is not considering the distance the hiker can cover before the need to refill the termos (water container) and the allowed distance without water after the last refill.

We need to find the minimal number of popasuri given the constraints and select the last path from the input if there are multiple paths with the same number of minimal popasuri. The distance from the last source to the peak is always 1 kilometer, and the hiker can travel `u` kilometers without water, so the last segment of the journey (after the last refill) must also be considered.

Let's rewrite the solution with a correct implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("popas.in");
    std::ofstream out("popas.out");

    int k, t, u;
    in >> k >> t >> u;

    int min_popasuri = INT_MAX;
    int traseu_ales = 0;
    int total_distance = 360; // The total distance to the peak is 360 km.

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int numar_traseu, r;
        in >> numar_traseu >> r;

        int last_popas = 0; // The last point where the hiker refilled the termos.
        int popasuri = 0; // Number of stops for refilling the termos.

        bool can_complete = true;
        int next_source = 0;

        // Read distances to sources and calculate when to make a popas.
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            in >> next_source;

            // Determine if a popas is needed before reaching the next source.
            if (next_source - last_popas > t) {
                // We must refill before this source. Check if it's the first source.
                if (j == 0) {
                    can_complete = false;
                    break; // Cannot start the traseu because the first source is too far.
                }
                last_popas = next_source - 1; // Refill just before this source.
                popasuri++;
            }
        }

        // If not already disqualified, check if we can reach the peak after the last popas.
        if (can_complete) {
            if (total_distance - last_popas > t + u) {
                // We cannot reach the peak with the current number of stops.
                popasuri++; // Add an extra stop at the last source.
            }

            // Update the minimum number of popasuri and select the current traseu if better.

This code should now properly evaluate the need for a stop and whether the peak can be reached with the given constraints for each path. It selects the last path with the minimum number of stops if there are several such paths. The output should match the expected result.

After carefully reviewing the problem statement and the input data once again, I believe I have identified the mistake in the previous solution implementations. When considering where to make a stop to refill the water, the code must account for the fact that the distance traveled with a full termos is `t` kilometers, and the hiker has an additional `u` kilometers they can travel without water.

Moreover, I misunderstood the input format: I wrongly assumed the first number on the line after `k` is a trail identifier, but it is actually `r`, the number of sources for the trail.

We need to adjust the logic to:

1. Read each source distance for a trail and determine whether the hiker needs to stop based on the condition that `d_i - last_stop > t`, where `d_i` is the distance to the current source and `last_stop` is the distance to the last source where the hiker stopped.
2. Include the final 1-kilometer ascent to the peak in the calculation, which requires the hiker to have enough water to reach the peak or to be within `u` kilometers of the peak after their last refill.
3. Ensure that if multiple trails have the same minimum number of stops, select the one that appears last in the input file.

Let's rewrite the solution with these corrections:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("popas.in");
    std::ofstream out("popas.out");

    int k, t, u;
    in >> k >> t >> u;

    int min_popasuri = k + 1; // Start with a large number of stops, more than the maximum possible.
    int traseu_ales = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
        int r;
        in >> r;
        
        std::vector<int> izvoare(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            in >> izvoare[j];
        }
        izvoare.push_back(360); // Add the peak as the last "source".

        int popasuri = (izvoare[0] > t) ? k + 1 : 0; // Initialize number of stops.
        int last_popas = 0; // Distance at the last refill.

        for (int j = 1; j <= r && popasuri < k + 1; ++j) {
            // Check if we can reach the next source without a stop.
            if (izvoare[j] - last_popas > t) {
                // We must refill at the previous source.
                last_popas = izvoare[j - 1];
                popasuri++;
            }
        }

        // Check if we can reach the peak from the last source without a new stop.
        if (popasuri < k + 1 && 360 - last_popas > t) {
            if (360 - last_popas - t <= u) { // If we can reach the peak with the 'u' extra kilometers.
                popasuri++; // One more stop is required at the last source.
            } else {
                popasuri = k + 1; // It's not possible to reach the peak, so this path is invalid.
            }
        }

        // Update the minimum number of popasuri and select the current traseu if better.
        if (popasuri < min_popasuri) {
            min_popasuri = popasuri;
            traseu_ales = i;
        } else if (popasuri == min_popasuri) {
            traseu_ales = i; // Select the last path in case of tie.
        }
    }

    // Output the result.
    if (min_popasuri > k) {
        out << "0"; // If no valid path was found, output 0.
    } else {
        out << min_popasuri << " " << traseu_ales;
    }

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution updates the minimum number of stops properly and selects the last path in case of a tie. It should produce the expected result for the given input.
