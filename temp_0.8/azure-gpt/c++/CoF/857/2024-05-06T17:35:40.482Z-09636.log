Gigel a primit de ziua lui un joc cu bile. Jocul conține $n$ bile numerotate cu numerele naturale distincte de la $1$ la $n$. Jucându-se, Gigel a amestecat bilele astfel încât acum ele nu mai sunt în ordine. Ca să le pună înapoi în cutia jocului, Gigel ia de pe masă bilele una câte una, și le pune în cutie formând un șir. Însă Gigel se joacă și acum, astfel încât el nu pune bilele la rând, una după alta, ci are o regulă pe care o respectă cu strictețe. Astfel, Gigel încearcă să plaseze fiecare bilă pe care a luat-o de pe masă exact la mijlocul șirului de bile deja format. Dacă acest lucru nu este posibil (șirul are lungime impară), atunci el plasează bila la sfârșitul șirului de bile deja format. După ce toate bilele au fost puse în cutie, Gigel își dă seama că nu a notat ordinea în care a luat bilele de pe masă și, în mod firesc, își pune problema dacă nu cumva poate deduce acest lucru din șirul de bile pe care tocmai l-a format.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se numărul de bile și configurația finală a bilelor în șir să se determine:
1. numărul ultimei bile luate de pe masă;
2. ordinea în care bilele au fost luate de pe masă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ordine.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $n$ de bile. Pe linia a doua a fișierului de intrare se găsesc $n$ numere naturale, cu valori între $1$ și $n$, separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă șirul de bile obținut de Gigel în cutie. Linia a treia conține una dintre valorile $1$ sau $2$ reprezentând cerința $1$, dacă se cere determinarea ultimei bile luate de Gigel de pe masă, respectiv cerința $2$, dacă se cere determinarea ordinii în care Gigel a luat bilele de pe masă.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `ordine.out` va conține pe prima linie o valoarea naturală reprezentând numărul ultimei bile luate de Gigel, dacă cerința a fost $1$, respectiv $n$ numere naturale, cu valori cuprinse între $1$ și $n$, separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă ordinea în care Gigel a luat bilele de pe masă, dacă cerința a fost $2$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 250 \ 000$;
* Pentru cerința $1$ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerința $2$ se acordă $70\%$ din punctaj.

Explanation:
- Open the input and output files.
- Read the value of `n` and the sequence of balls (`v` vector) from the input file.
- Also, read the value of the question (either 1 or 2).
- If the question is 1, determine the last ball by checking if `n` is even or odd and output the corresponding value.
- If the question is 2, reconstruct the order by iterating backward through the vector and adding the elements to a deque (`dq`) either at the front or back, depending on the current size of the deque.
- For question 2, after reconstructing the order, write the reversed deque to the output file.

The incorrect output suggests that the logic for reconstructing the order of balls (question 2) is flawed. The problem is that the deque-based reconstruction method does not account for Gigel's rule of placing the ball in the middle of the existing sequence. Instead, it alternates between pushing to the front and back, which is not equivalent to Gigel's placement rule.

The correct approach should simulate the reverse of Gigel's actions. We need to keep track of the middle of the deque and adjust it accordingly as we insert elements at the end or beginning of the deque to simulate Gigel's actions in reverse. This way, we can reconstruct the original order in which the balls were picked.

Let's fix the solution and rewrite it:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n, question;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> balls(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> balls[i];
    }
    fin >> question;

    if (question == 1) {
        // The last ball Gigel put in the box is the last ball he picked up,
        // which is the one located at the position n/2 after his operations are done.
        fout << balls[n / 2] << '\n';
    } else {
        // We'll store the reconstructed order in a list and use iterators
        // to simulate Gigel's placement rule in reverse.
        std::list<int> order;
        auto it = order.begin();

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                // Simulate placing the ball at the end when the sequence length is odd.
                order.insert(it, balls[i]);
                if (i != 0) --it; // move the iterator to the middle for the next insertion
            } else {
                // Simulate placing the ball in the middle when the sequence length is even.
                // No need to move the iterator here because we are inserting before it.
                order.insert(it, balls[i]);
            }
        }

        for (it = order.begin(); it != order.end(); ++it) {
            if (it != order.begin()) {
                fout << ' ';
            }
            fout << *it;
        }
        fout << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The corrected code uses a list to store the reconstructed order. This allows us to use an iterator to efficiently represent the middle of the sequence for insertions. For each ball in reverse order, we insert it into the list according to whether the current size of the list (before insertion) is even or odd, which are the reverse conditions of Gigel's rule of placement.

The issue with the previous implementation is that it doesn't correctly simulate Gigel's rule in reverse. To simulate the rule in reverse, we need to consider how the middle of the sequence changes as elements are added. The middle element becomes the end of the deque when an even number of elements are present, and it becomes the start of the deque when an odd number of elements is present.

Let's implement this correctly:

1. Use a deque to efficiently insert elements at both the beginning and end.
2. Start with an empty deque.
3. Iterate through the given sequence from right to left.
4. For each element, if the current size of the deque is odd, insert the element at the beginning of the deque. If the size is even, insert it at the end.
5. After reconstructing the order, output the elements of the deque from left to right for question 2.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <deque>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n, question;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> sequence(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }
    fin >> question;

    if (question == 1) {
        fout << sequence[n / 2] << '\n'; // The last element is always the middle element.
    } else {
        std::deque<int> reconstructedOrder;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) { // For even index from the end (odd number of elements)
                reconstructedOrder.push_front(sequence[i]);
            } else { // For odd index from the end (even number of elements)
                reconstructedOrder.push_back(sequence[i]);
            }
        }

        // Output the elements in the reconstructed order.
        for (size_t i = 0; i < reconstructedOrder.size(); ++i) {
            if (i > 0) fout << ' ';
            fout << reconstructedOrder[i];
        }
        fout << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation should correctly simulate the reversal of Gigel's placement rule and produce the expected output for both questions.

The issue with the previous attempts is the incorrect handling of the order in which balls were placed by Gigel. The actual process is complex because Gigel places the ball in the middle or at the end depending on the parity of the number of balls in the sequence at the time he places each ball. To reverse this process, we need to consider where the balls would have been placed during the process, which involves tracking the middle position correctly.

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Start from the last element of the given sequence, which is the first ball Gigel would have placed.
2. Use a deque to insert elements in the middle and at the end as we go back in time to figure out the order.
3. Adjust the position of the middle after each insert to simulate Gigel's process in reverse.
4. We need to simulate this process in a way that handles the movement of the middle properly.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n, question;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> sequence(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }
    fin >> question;

    std::deque<int> order;

    if (question == 1) {
        fout << sequence[n / 2] << '\n';
    } else {
        order.push_back(sequence[n - 1]); // Start with the last element placed, which is the middle ball

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (i % 2 == n % 2) {
                order.push_front(sequence[i]); // When i and n are of the same parity, push at the beginning
            } else {
                order.push_back(sequence[i]); // When i and n are of different parity, push at the end
                // Rotate the last element to the front to simulate placing in the middle
                order.push_front(order.back());
                order.pop_back();
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (i > 0) fout << ' ';
            fout << order[i];
        }
        fout << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution properly simulates the reverse of Gigel's ball placing process, keeping track of the middle position using the parity of `i` and `n`, and should produce the correct order of balls for both questions.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to reverse the process that Gigel used to place the balls. Since Gigel places each ball in the middle of the sequence (or at the end if the sequence has an odd length), we need to reverse this operation considering that the middle position changes every time a ball is added.

We can reconstruct the sequence by always choosing the ball that would end up being the middle ball in the final sequence. To find this ball, we'll iterate over the final sequence in a specific pattern that mimics the reverse of Gigel's process.

Here's the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n, question;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> sequence(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }
    fin >> question;

    if (question == 1) {
        fout << sequence[(n - 1) / 2] << '\n'; // The middle ball in the final sequence.
    } else {
        std::vector<int> order(n);
        int left = 0, right = n - 1, step = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Alternate between choosing from the left and right ends of the current sequence.
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                order[i] = sequence[left];
                left += step; // Move towards the middle.
            } else {
                order[i] = sequence[right];
                right -= step; // Move towards the middle.
            }
            // After reaching the middle, change direction and change the step size.
            if (left > right) {
                step = -1;
                left = n / 2;
                right = (n - 1) / 2;
            }
        }

        // Write the order of the balls.
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            fout << order[i];
            if (i > 0) fout << " ";
        }
        fout << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The solution reads the input from `ordine.in`, reconstructs the order of the balls (if `question` is 2), and writes the result to `ordine.out`.

For question 2, the algorithm uses a pattern that mimics the reverse of Gigel's ball placement process. The middle of the sequence is changing as we iterate, so we adjust `left` and `right` pointers to correctly pick the ball that would have been put into the sequence at each step. Once we reach the middle, we change the direction and step size to continue correctly picking the middle balls in reverse order. After reconstructing the sequence, we output it in reverse, since we've built it starting from the last ball Gigel would have placed.

The differences between the expected and found result are due to incorrect logic in reconstructing the order of the balls. The algorithm needs to correctly mimic the process in reverse, by selecting the ball that would have been placed at the middle of the sequence for each step, taking into consideration the movement of the middle position as balls are added.

To reverse the process correctly, we must use two main insights:

1. The ball that ends up at the middle index (`n / 2`) is the last ball placed.
2. In each step before placing the last ball, the ball that was placed would have been in the middle of the remaining sequence. Therefore, we need to reverse-engineer which ball would end up where, considering how the sequence grows in Gigel's game.

We will apply an algorithm that reconstructs the order by inferring the position of each ball at each step:

1. Start with `last_ball` being the middle ball of the final sequence.
2. Keep track of the indices that the middle ball can come from, which alternate between the left and right sides of the last middle ball.
3. Simulate the process of removing the middle ball and shrinking the sequence, updating the possible positions of the new middle ball.
4. Continue until the sequence is empty.

Here is the rewritten solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n, question;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }
    fin >> question;

    if (question == 1) {
        fout << sequence[n / 2] << '\n';
    } else {
        std::vector<int> order(n); // To store the order of the balls
        int last_ball_position = n / 2;
        int left = 0; // Left boundary of the current sequence
        int right = n - 1; // Right boundary of the current sequence
        int step = (n % 2 == 0 ? -1 : 1); // Direction of movement for the middle position
        
        // Calculate positions from which Gigel could have taken the next ball
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            order[i] = sequence[last_ball_position];
            if (i == 0) break; // Stop after placing the first ball
            
            // Update the boundaries based on the direction of movement
            if (step == -1) { // Move left
                if ((left - last_ball_position) % 2 == 0) left++;
                else right--;
            } else { // Move right
                if ((right - last_ball_position) % 2 == 0) right--;
                else left++;
            }
            // Update the middle position for the next iteration
            last_ball_position = (step == -1) ? (last_ball_position - 1 + n) % i : (last_ball_position + 1) % i;
            // Change the direction of movement every time we pass through the middle
            if ((step == -1 && last_ball_position < left) || (step == 1 && last_ball_position > right)) {
                step *= -1;
            }
        }
        
        // Output the order of the balls
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            fout << order[i];
            if (i < n - 1) fout << ' ';
        }
        fout << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This algorithm should correctly reverse Gigel's process and output the correct order of balls for question 2.

I apologize for the confusion in the previous attempts. It seems there was a mistake in correctly reversing Gigel's ball placement process. Let's approach the problem with a clear strategy.

To deduce the order in which Gigel picked the balls, we need to simulate the process in reverse. At each step, we need to identify the ball that Gigel would have placed last to create the current sequence. Initially, the last ball Gigel placed is at the middle index of the sequence. After we identify the last ball in each step, we effectively remove it from the sequence and adjust the middle index according to the rule:

- If the length of the sequence before removing the last ball was even, the middle index would decrease by one.
- If the length of the sequence before removing the last ball was odd, the middle index would remain the same.

For example, with the sequence `1 7 2 5 3 4 6` and n=7:

- The last ball to be placed is `5` (at index 3, which is `n/2`).
- After `5` is removed, we have `1 7 2 3 4 6`. The next middle index is still `2` (because we removed an element from a list of length 7, which is odd).
- The next ball to be removed is `2`.
- After `2` is removed, we have `1 7 3 4 6`. The next middle index becomes `1` (because we removed an element from a list of length 6, which is even).
- And so on.

Based on this process, we can construct the reversal of the ordering. Here's the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n, query;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> sequence(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }
    fin >> query;

    if (query == 1) {
        // For query 1, output the middle element of the sequence.
        fout << sequence[n / 2] << '\n';
    } else {
        // For query 2, reconstruct the order in which the balls were picked.
        std::vector<int> order; // Will contain the reversed process
        order.reserve(n); // Reserve space for efficiency

        int middle = n / 2; // Start at the middle index
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Place the current middle ball in the reverse order.
            order.push_back(sequence[middle]);

            // Calculate the new middle index based on the remaining number of balls.
            int remaining = n - i - 1; // Number of balls remaining after this step
            if (remaining % 2 == 0) { // If even, move the middle to the left
                middle = (middle - 1 + remaining) % remaining;
            } else { // If odd, middle stays at the same index
                middle %= remaining;
            }
        }

        // Output the order in which the balls were picked (reverse of the reversed process).
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            fout << order[i];
            if (i > 0) fout << ' ';
        }
        fout << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code should correctly simulate the placement and reverse placement of the balls, providing the correct order for question 2.
