Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

    // Find the minimum cost for the last jump to the bottom-right corner
    int min_cost = INT_MAX;
    // We skip the first column since we cannot jump from the same column
    for (int k = 1; k < n; k++)
        min_cost = std::min(min_cost, cost[m - 2][k] + matrix[m - 1][k]);
    min_cost += matrix[m - 1][n - 1]; // Add cost of the bottom-right corner
    
    out << min_cost << std::endl;

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```
This solution should satisfy the constraints, read from "lacusta.in", and write the output to "lacusta.out" while avoiding the use of the forbidden input and output methods. The program uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost to reach each cell, considering the jumps and steps rules provided in the challenge description.

The initial implementation has a mistake in the logic for computing minimum costs, and the final result is incorrect because the `cost` matrix is not correctly updated. The solution should track the minimum cost for each cell in the matrix while considering the constraints of the traversal. Let's fix the logic accordingly.

We'll fix the algorithm as follows:

- Initialize the `cost` matrix to `INT_MAX` for all cells except the starting cell.
- Update the cost matrix while traversing the matrix from the second row to the bottom.
- The last move is only a horizontal move from any cell in the second-to-last row to the last cell of the last row, so we will treat it separately.
- Write the minimum cost to `lacusta.out`.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("lacusta.in");
    std::ofstream out("lacusta.out");

    int m, n;
    in >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> cost(m, std::vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            in >> matrix[i][j];

    // Start point
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0];
    cost[1][0] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][0]; // Cost to get to the first cell of the second row

    // Fill the cost matrix by computing the minimum cost at each position
    for (int i = 1; i < m - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (j != k) {
                    int new_cost = cost[i][k] + matrix[i + 1][j] + matrix[i][j];
                    if (new_cost < cost[i + 1][j])
                        cost[i + 1][j] = new_cost;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Compute the final minimum cost by jumping from the second-to-last row
    // to the bottom-right corner
    int min_cost = INT_MAX;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
        if (k != n - 1) {
            min_cost = std::min(min_cost, cost[m - 2][k] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1]);
        }
    }

    out << min_cost << std::endl;

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Now the solution should compute the minimum cost correctly and match the expected output. Please note that I have used `std::vector` instead of raw arrays to manage the matrix and cost table, which is a more C++ idiomatic way of handling dynamic tables.

The issue with the previous code is that it does not correctly handle the minimum cost calculation, particularly in checking the minimum cost to transition from one cell to another. It is also not properly accounting for the fact that the traversal starts at the top-left corner and ends at the bottom-right corner with specific rules for the first and last moves. The minimum cost must account for the sum of two cells on each move, except for the first and last moves.

We'll redefine the algorithm to fix the issues:

1. We need to initialize the cost of the first cell and the cell immediately below it correctly. The cost of reaching the second cell in the path is the sum of the first cell (top-left corner) and the cell below it, as you can only move vertically down for the first move.
2. Then, starting from the second row, we will compute the cost for each cell, which is the sum of the current cell value plus the minimum cost to reach the cell above it from any other column. We will update the cost for each cell accordingly.
3. The last move to the bottom-right corner must be handled separately. Since we can only move horizontally on the last move, we need to find the minimum sum of moving from any cell in the second-to-last row to the last cell in the last row.

Let's rewrite the code with the correct algorithm:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("lacusta.in");
    std::ofstream out("lacusta.out");

    int m, n;
    in >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> cost(m, std::vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            in >> matrix[i][j];

    // The starting point and first move, which is only moving down
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0];
    cost[1][0] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][0];

    // Compute cost for all paths from the 3rd row to the second-last row
    for (int i = 2; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (j != k) {
                    cost[i][j] = std::min(cost[i][j], cost[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i - 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Final move to bottom-right corner
    int min_cost = INT_MAX;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
        if (k != n - 1) {
            min_cost = std::min(min_cost, cost[m - 1][k] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1]);
        }
    }

    out << min_cost << std::endl;

    // Close file streams
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly compute the minimum cost to traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, following the specified rules of the challenge. The output should match the expected output.

The previous solutions have failed to identify the correct minimum cost due to incorrect algorithm implementation. The key is to properly initialize the cost matrix and handle the constraints of the traversal. Let's revise the algorithm and reimplement the solution accordingly:

1. Initialize the cost of the first cell to its value.
2. The first move can only be a vertical step down, so the cost of the second cell in the path is the sum of the first cell and the cell below it.
3. For each cell starting from the second row to the second-last row, we need to find the minimum cost from any cell in the previous row, excluding the case when we try to move vertically down.
4. The last move must be a horizontal move to the bottom-right corner from any cell in the second-last row, excluding the last column cell.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("lacusta.in");
    std::ofstream out("lacusta.out");

    int m, n;
    in >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> cost(m, std::vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            in >> matrix[i][j];

    // Start point
    cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0];

    // Initialize the cost for the second row
    for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
        cost[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][j] + matrix[1][0];
    }

    // Fill the cost matrix by computing the minimum cost at each position
    for (int i = 2; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (j != k) { // Cannot move vertically down
                    cost[i][j] = std::min(cost[i][j], cost[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i - 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Compute the final minimum cost by considering the cost to jump to the bottom-right corner
    // We must move from the second-last row to the last row (horizontally)
    int min_cost = INT_MAX;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) { // Cannot come from the last column
        min_cost = std::min(min_cost, cost[m - 1][j] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1]);
    }

    out << min_cost << std::endl;

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should compute the minimum cost to traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner following the specified rules, and output the correct result expected for the given input.

The results differ because the previous solutions contained logical errors in the cost calculation and did not correctly implement the constraints of the problem, particularly the restriction that the first and last moves are different from the others. Let's rewrite the algorithm to ensure that it correctly calculates the minimum cost:

1. Initialize the cost matrix to a high value (like `INT_MAX`) for all cells except the starting cell at the top-left corner (matrix[0][0]).
2. The first move can only be a vertical step down, so the cost of the second cell in the path must be initialized as the sum of the first cell and the cell directly below it.
3. From the second row onwards, calculate the minimum cost for each cell by considering the cost of moving from any other cell in the previous row (excluding the column directly above, as vertical moves are not allowed except for the first move).
4. The last move must be a horizontal move from any cell in the second-last row to the bottom-right corner, so calculate this separately and add it to the minimum cost found in the second-last row.

Now let's implement the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("lacusta.in");
    std::ofstream out("lacusta.out");

    int m, n;
    in >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m, std::vector<int>(n, std::numeric_limits<int>::max()));

    // Read in the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            in >> matrix[i][j];

    // Initialize the starting point
    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0];

    // Calculate the minimum cost for the second row
    for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
        dp[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][j];
    }

    // Calculate the minimum path sum from the second row onward
    for (int i = 2; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (k != j) {
                    dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i - 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Final step is to move from a position in the second last row to the bottom right corner
    int min_cost = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        min_cost = std::min(min_cost, dp[m - 2][j] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1]);
    }
    
    // Write the result to the output file
    out << min_cost << std::endl;

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution initializes the cost matrix properly, calculates the correct cost for each step according to the problem constraints, and finds the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right corner.

My apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's take a fresh look at the problem and solve it correctly. The minimum cost of traversal must include:

- The cost of the top-left cell.
- The cost of one cell on every row starting from the second row.
- The cost of a cell on the last row that is not directly below the second-to-last cell visited.
- The cost of the bottom-right cell.

The algorithm should use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost to arrive at each cell with the constraints given.

Let me provide the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("lacusta.in");
    std::ofstream out("lacusta.out");

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            in >> matrix[i][j];

    // Starting point
    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0];
    // Initialize the first move (only vertical move allowed)
    dp[1][0] = dp[0][0] + matrix[1][0];

    // Fill the cost matrix by computing the minimum cost at each position
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                // Cannot move vertically down or stay in the same column
                if (j != k)
                    dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j]);
                // Special handling for the second row initialization
                if (i == 1 && j != k)
                    dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[0][0] + matrix[i][k] + matrix[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Final jump to the bottom-right corner, excluding the vertical move from the cell above
    int min_cost = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    for (int k = 0; k < n - 1; ++k) { // Exclude last column
        min_cost = std::min(min_cost, dp[m - 2][k] + matrix[m - 1][k]);
    }
    min_cost += matrix[m - 1][n - 1]; // Add cost of the bottom-right corner

    out << min_cost << std::endl;

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution initializes the first two rows correctly and iterates through the matrix to calculate the cost of moving to each cell, with the rules that we cannot move directly down and that we must reach the bottom-right corner with a horizontal move from the second-to-last row. The output of this program should match the expected result.
