Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

The previous solution wrongly assumed that sorting the towers and taking the maximum value in reverse order would lead to the maximum sum of heights for the hills. Instead, we should go through the initial array without sorting and keep track of the current maximum height; whenever a value is greater than the current maximum, it becomes the new peak for the next hill.

I will now fix the algorithm and implement the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> towers(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> towers[i];
    }

    long long sumOfHeights = 0;
    int currentMax = 0;

    // Traverse the towers array from left to right to form hills.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (towers[i] > currentMax) {
            sumOfHeights += towers[i];
            currentMax = towers[i];
        }
    }

    // Write the result to the output file.
    fout << sumOfHeights << '\n';

    // Close the files.
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates through the array of towers. If a new tower is taller than the current maximum, it can be the peak of a new hill, and its height is added to the sum. This way, we ensure that the hills formed have the maximum possible sum of heights, as required by the problem statement.

The previous solution still had a logical error. The algorithm did not take into account that multiple hills can be constructed, and a single tower can be part of multiple hills if the heights are non-decreasing. The task is to find the sum of the peaks of such hills. We should go through the array and keep track of the current maximum height while adding it to the sum every time we find a new peak or a tower of equal height to the current peak (as it can be part of the same hill).

Let's fix the algorithm with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    int height;
    int currentMax = 0;
    long long sumOfHeights = 0;

    // Traverse the towers, and if the current tower is as high as or higher than
    // the previous one, it can be a peak or part of a peak for a new hill.
    while (N--) {
        fin >> height;
        if (height >= currentMax) {
            sumOfHeights += height;
            currentMax = height;
        }
    }

    // Write the result to the output file.
    fout << sumOfHeights << '\n';

    // Close the files.
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should correctly add to the sum every time a tower can be part of a hill's peak, including when multiple adjacent towers are of the same height. This should result in the correct output, as the task requires us to find the sum of the heights of all possible hills that can be formed by placing the towers in a non-decreasing order.

Apologies for the confusion. The previous solutions misunderstood the problem statement. We need to construct sequences of non-decreasing towers to form hills. Each hill can have peaks of the same height, and the height of the hill is the height of its highest tower. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of hill heights.

The correct algorithm should not sort the input data or just traverse the list once since we can form multiple hills with the same peaks. We need to traverse the list of towers and keep track of each new hill formation by checking if the current tower is less than the previous tower's height (indicating the end of the current hill and the start of a new one).

Let's implement the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> towers(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> towers[i];
    }

    long long sumOfHeights = 0;
    int currentMax = 0;

    // Go through each tower to determine the hills
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // If we find a tower that is smaller than the currentMax,
        // we've reached the end of a hill, and we reset the currentMax.
        if (towers[i] < currentMax) {
            currentMax = towers[i];
        } else {
            // We've found a peak, so we add it to the sum.
            sumOfHeights += currentMax;
            currentMax = towers[i];
        }
    }
    // Add the last peak.
    sumOfHeights += currentMax;

    // Write the result to the output file.
    fout << sumOfHeights << '\n';

    // Close the files.
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution keeps track of the current maximum height (currentMax) while iterating through the towers. If the current tower's height is less than currentMax, it means we have finished a hill and we reset currentMax. If it is greater or equal, it is a peak or part of a peak, and we add the currentMax to the sum. We also add the last peak outside the loop to ensure we count the last hill. This should give us the correct maximum possible sum of all hill heights.

The error in my previous solutions stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem. The task is to maximize the sum of the heights of the hills, which can be formed by aligning the towers to create sequences of non-decreasing heights. When we encounter a tower that is shorter than the previous one, it signals the start of a new hill.

To fix this, we need to take a different approach, where we iterate through the towers from left to right and keep track of the current hill's peak height. When we find a tower that is taller than the current peak, we set it as the new peak. If we encounter a tower that is shorter than the current peak, we start a new hill, and that tower becomes the peak of the new hill.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }

    // Track the peak height of the current and the previous hills.
    int currentPeak = 0;
    long long sumOfHeights = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] > currentPeak) {
            // If the current tower is taller than the current peak,
            // it becomes the new peak of the current hill.
            currentPeak = heights[i];
        }
        // Regardless of whether the peak changed, the current tower's height
        // contributes to the sum as part of the current hill's peak.
        sumOfHeights += currentPeak;
    }

    // Write the sum of the hill heights to the output file.
    fout << sumOfHeights << '\n';

    // Close the files.
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly compute the maximum sum of the hill heights by considering each tower's contribution to the current hill's peak and starting a new hill when a shorter tower is encountered.

My apologies for the continued oversight. Let's reassess the task at hand.

We're given an array of tower heights, and we need to align them to create a sequence of non-decreasing hills such that each tower is part of at least one hill and the sum of the heights of the tallest towers (peaks) of these hills is maximized.

Let's correct the algorithm and implement a proper solution:

1. We need to go through the towers from left to right.
2. Each time we encounter a tower that is taller than the previous one, it becomes the peak of a new hill.
3. Whenever we encounter a tower that is shorter than or equal to the previous one, it can be included in the current hill and does not increase the sum of heights.

Now let's write the updated solution code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> towers(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> towers[i];
    }

    long long sumOfHeights = 0;
    int currentMax = 0;

    // Iterate through the towers to form hills and calculate the sum of heights.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (towers[i] > currentMax) {
            // If the current tower is taller than the currentMax,
            // it becomes the peak of a new hill.
            sumOfHeights += towers[i];
            currentMax = towers[i];
        }
        // If the current tower is not taller than the currentMax,
        // it is part of the descending slope of the current hill or starts a new one.
    }

    // Write the result to the output file.
    fout << sumOfHeights << '\n';

    // Close the files.
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution will iterate through the `towers` array, and every time a tower is taller than `currentMax`, it adds that tower's height to `sumOfHeights` and updates `currentMax` with the new height. This process ensures that we always add the peak of each hill to the sum, and we do not add the height of towers that are part of a descending slope or the same height as the peak. This should provide the expected output.

After reviewing the problem statement and the previous solutions, it seems there's a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements. The key detail is that when arranging the towers in a line to form hills, each tower can be part of multiple hills, as long as the heights are non-decreasing. We need to make sure to add the height of the tallest tower to the sum whenever we start a new hill.

Let's reevaluate the approach:

1. Iterate over the array of tower heights.
2. If the current tower height is greater than or equal to the height of the last tower in the current hill, it can be added to the current hill, and we do not start a new hill.
3. If the current tower height is less than the height of the last tower in the current hill, we start a new hill. This means we add the height of the last tower of the previous hill to the sum.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }

    long long sumOfHeights = 0;
    int currentMaxHeight = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] >= currentMaxHeight) {
            // If the current tower is taller or equal to the current max height,
            // it is part of the current hill.
            currentMaxHeight = heights[i];
        } else {
            // If the current tower is shorter than the current max height,
            // it is the start of a new hill, and we add the height of the last hill to the sum.
            sumOfHeights += currentMaxHeight;
            currentMaxHeight = heights[i];
        }
    }
    // We add the height of the last hill to the sum.
    sumOfHeights += currentMaxHeight;

    fout << sumOfHeights << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now properly calculate the sum of the hill heights by considering each tower's contribution to the height of the hills and accounting for the start of new hills when necessary. The result should match the expected output.
