Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it's clear that sorting the heights and choosing the maximum height as the peak of each "hill" in a greedy manner does not give us the maximum sum of hill heights as required by the problem. 

The algorithm should instead maintain the current height of the hill being formed and only start a new hill when the next tower's height is greater than the current hill height. This way, each tower is used at most once, and we maximize the sum of the hill heights.

Let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    std::sort(heights.begin(), heights.end(), std::greater<>()); // Sort in non-ascending order

    long long sum = 0;
    int current_height = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] > current_height) {
            sum += heights[i];
            current_height = heights[i];
        }
    }

    fout << sum << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution first sorts the towers in non-ascending order to ensure that when iterating through the towers, we can start a new hill whenever we encounter a tower taller than the current hill height. This guarantees that we use the tallest towers to maximize the sum of the hill heights, as per the problem's requirement.

The issue with the re-implemented solution is that it's still not correctly forming hills according to the rules described. Sorting the heights is not the required method for this problem. Instead, we need to form hills by iterating over the array of heights without sorting them, and whenever we find a height that is greater than or equal to the previous one, we consider it part of the current hill. We start a new hill when we encounter a height that is less than the height of the last tower in the current hill. The peak of each hill is the maximum height encountered so far for that hill.

Let's rewrite the solution considering the correct logic:
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    long long sum = 0;
    int current_hill_height = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] >= current_hill_height) {
            current_hill_height = heights[i];
        } else {
            sum += current_hill_height; // Finish the current hill and add its height to the sum
            current_hill_height = heights[i]; // Start a new hill
        }
    }
    sum += current_hill_height; // Add the last hill's height to the sum

    fout << sum << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```
With this solution, we no longer sort the heights. We iterate through them once, forming hills and accumulating the sum of the hill heights as per the rules. This solution should provide the correct output.

The current issue with the solution is that it incorrectly accumulates the sum of hill heights, as it adds the height of a new hill too soon, before actually determining if we have finished building the current hill.

To fix this, we need to adjust our approach to only add the height of the current hill to the sum when we are certain that the current hill has ended. The current hill ends when we encounter a tower that is shorter than the peak of the last hill that was added to the sum.

Let's correct the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    long long sum = 0;
    int peak_height = 0; // The peak height of the current hill
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] > peak_height) {
            // If we find a higher tower, it becomes the new peak of the current hill.
            peak_height = heights[i];
        } else {
            // If the current tower height is not higher than the peak, we end the current hill and add its height to the sum.
            sum += peak_height;
            // The current tower starts a new hill, so it's the new peak.
            peak_height = heights[i];
        }
    }
    // Add the last hill's height to the sum
    sum += peak_height;

    fout << sum << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution maintains the peak height of the current hill and only adds it to the sum when a new hill is started, ensuring the sum is correctly calculated. This should yield the expected output for the problem.

The previous solution incorrectly updates the peak height and adds to the sum for each decrease in height. According to the problem statement, a hill is made up of towers that are in non-decreasing order. When a lower tower is encountered, the previous peak should be added to the sum, and the height of the lower tower should be considered for a potential new hill.

However, if subsequent towers are equal to or greater than this lower tower, they should be included in the new hill, and if a tower higher than any previous peak is encountered, then it becomes the new peak for the current hill.

Let's fix the solution by correctly tracking when to start a new hill and when to add the peak of the completed hill to the sum:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    long long sum = 0;
    int current_hill_peak = 0; // The peak height of the current hill

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] >= current_hill_peak) {
            // As long as the height of the current tower is greater than or equal to the peak of the current hill,
            // it becomes part of the current hill. If it's greater, it becomes the new peak.
            current_hill_peak = heights[i];
        } else {
            // If the current tower is lower than the peak of the current hill, we conclude the current hill and
            // add its peak to the sum, then start a new hill with the current tower as its initial peak.
            sum += current_hill_peak;
            current_hill_peak = heights[i];
        }
    }

    // Add the peak of the last hill to the sum
    sum += current_hill_peak;

    fout << sum << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```
This corrected solution should now provide the expected sum of 22 for the example input. It properly handles when a hill ends and a new one begins, ensuring that the sum of hill heights is maximum.

The previous solutions did not correctly determine when to finish one hill and start another, which led to incorrect sums. The problem requires that we only start a new hill when we encounter a tower shorter than the last tower included in the current hill. If the next tower is equal or taller, it is part of the same hill. Upon encountering a shorter tower, the height of the last hill (the height of the tallest tower in that hill) is added to the sum, and the new hill starts with the shorter tower.

Let's fix the solution by tracking the last tower height and updating the sum when a shorter tower is encountered:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    long long sum = 0;
    int last_height = 0; // Height of the last tower in the current hill
    int hill_peak = 0; // Peak height of the current hill

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] < last_height) {
            // If the current tower is shorter than the last one, the current hill has ended.
            sum += hill_peak; // Add the peak of the current hill to the sum
            hill_peak = heights[i]; // Start a new hill with the current tower
        } else {
            // Otherwise, the current tower is part of the current hill.
            if (heights[i] > hill_peak) {
                // If the current tower is taller than the current peak, update the peak.
                hill_peak = heights[i];
            }
        }
        last_height = heights[i]; // Update the height of the last tower
    }

    // Add the peak of the last hill to the sum
    sum += hill_peak;

    fout << sum << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution tracks the height of the last tower (`last_height`) and the peak height of the current hill (`hill_peak`). It updates `hill_peak` as it encounters taller towers and adds `hill_peak` to `sum` when a smaller tower signals the end of the current hill. Finally, it adds the peak of the last hill after the loop. This should yield the correct sum for the given input.

The previous solution still incorrectly calculates the sum of the hill heights. The problem arises because the height of the current hill is not properly tracked and closed off before starting a new one. We need to ensure that we only start a new hill when we see a tower height that is strictly less than the height of the previous tower; if it's the same height or greater, it is considered part of the current hill.

Let's fix the solution by correctly identifying the end of a hill and then starting a new hill with the next tower height:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("deal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("deal.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    long long sum = 0;
    int current_max_height = 0; // The peak height of the current hill

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] > current_max_height) {
            // If the current tower is taller than the peak of the current hill, update the peak.
            current_max_height = heights[i];
        } else if (heights[i] < current_max_height) {
            // If we encounter a tower that is shorter than the peak of the current hill,
            // it means the current hill has ended, and we start a new hill.
            sum += current_max_height;  // Add the peak of the current hill to the sum
            current_max_height = heights[i]; // The height of the new hill's first tower.
        }
    }

    // The last hill's peak is not added in the loop, so we add it to the sum here.
    sum += current_max_height;

    fout << sum << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should now compute the correct sum by only updating the current maximum height when a taller tower is encountered, and adding that height to the sum when a shorter tower is found, indicating the end of the current hill. This logic should provide the expected output of 22 for the given input data.
