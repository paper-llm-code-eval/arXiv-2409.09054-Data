Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Below is the C++ solution to the described challenge:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> read_heights(const char *filename) {
    std::ifstream in(filename);
    int N;
    in >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> heights[i];
    }
    return heights;
}

void write_max_sum(const char *filename, long long sum) {
    std::ofstream out(filename);
    out << sum;
}

int main() {
    const char *input_file = "deal.in";
    const char *output_file = "deal.out";
    std::vector<int> heights = read_heights(input_file);
    
    long long max_sum = 0;
    int current_peak = 0;

    for (int height : heights) {
        if (height > current_peak) {
            current_peak = height;
        }
        max_sum += current_peak;
    }

    write_max_sum(output_file, max_sum);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the heights from `deal.in`, processes them to calculate the maximum sum of heights of the hills, then writes the result to `deal.out`. It avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, and `scanf` by directly reading from and writing to file streams.

Upon evaluating the differences, it's clear that the previous implementation calculated the sum by always taking the highest tower encountered so far, which is incorrect. Instead, the program should find sequences where each tower is greater than or equal to the previous and sum the heights of the tallest towers in each sequence.

In the given example, the correct sequences would be (10), (2, 2, 2, 7), and (5, 2), with peaks 10, 7, and 5, summing up to 22.

Let's rewrite the solution correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("deal.in");
    std::ofstream out("deal.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> heights[i];
    }
    
    long long max_sum = 0;
    int current_peak = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (i == 0 || heights[i] > heights[i - 1]) { // New hill sequence
            current_peak = heights[i];
        }
        max_sum += current_peak;

        // Adjust the peak for the next iteration if necessary
        if (i < N - 1 && heights[i] > heights[i + 1]) {
            current_peak = heights[i + 1];
        }
    }

    out << max_sum;

    return 0;
}
```

This code now correctly identifies sequences of hills by checking for a strictly increasing sequence and adjusts the peak when the sequence ends. It sums the height of the peak for each hill in the sequence. This should provide the correct output for the given problem statement.

Let's evaluate the differences and diagnose the issue. The previous solution is incorrectly summing the heights. According to the problem statement, only the tallest tower in each continuous, non-decreasing sequence should be counted towards the sum.

In the given example, we have different sequences of hills: (10), (2, 2, 2, 7), (5), (2). The previous solution incorrectly carried over the peak to the next sequence without resetting it when a decrease in height is encountered.

Here is the corrected solution that resets the peak when a decrease is detected and only sums the peak heights:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("deal.in");
    std::ofstream out("deal.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> heights[i];
    }
    
    // Initialize the sum with the first height as it will always be part of a hill
    long long max_sum = heights[0];
    int current_peak = heights[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] >= current_peak) {
            current_peak = heights[i]; // Current tower becomes the new peak of the hill
        } else {
            max_sum += current_peak;  // Sum up the current peak as the hill ends
            current_peak = heights[i]; // Start a new hill with the current tower
        }
    }
    // Add the last peak
    max_sum += current_peak;

    out << max_sum;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution takes into account that each non-decreasing sequence of towers forms a hill and only the tallest tower (the peak) contributes to the sum. When a decrease in height occurs, the peak of the last non-decreasing sequence is added to the sum, and a new sequence starts with the current tower as its peak.

The results differ because the updated solution still does not correctly identify the hills and their peaks according to the rules provided. A peak is only counted when a strictly increasing sequence is followed by a decrease, or it's the last tower in the input.

The problem is that the previous implementation did not correctly reset the peak after adding it to the sum, which leads to counting the same peak multiple times.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over the towers and keep track of the current peak. Whenever we encounter a tower that is shorter than the previous one, we add the current peak to the sum and set the new tower as the potential peak of the next hill.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("deal.in");
    std::ofstream out("deal.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> heights[i];
    }
    
    long long max_sum = 0;
    int current_peak = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] > current_peak) {
            current_peak = heights[i]; // Update the current peak if the current tower is taller
        }

        // When we reach the end or a decrease in height, add the current peak to the sum
        // and update the current peak to the next tower's height
        if (i == N - 1 || heights[i] > heights[i + 1]) {
            max_sum += current_peak;
            if (i < N - 1) {
                current_peak = heights[i + 1];
            }
        }
    }

    out << max_sum;

    return 0;
}
```

This should yield the correct output of `22` for the input provided, correctly identifying the hills' peaks and summing them up.

The previous solution still incorrectly calculates the sum by including the peak height of a hill that is not the last in the sequence. Specifically, it incorrectly starts a new hill before it's necessary, leading to an overestimation of the sum.

The correct approach is to continue with the current hill until we find a tower that is shorter than the previous one, indicating the end of the current hill and the start of a possible new hill.

We should only add the peak height to the sum when the sequence is strictly increasing and then encounters a decrease, or if we are at the last tower.

Let's write the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("deal.in");
    std::ofstream out("deal.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> heights[i];
    }

    long long max_sum = 0;
    int current_peak = heights[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] >= current_peak) {
            current_peak = heights[i];  // Update the current peak within the hill
        } else {
            max_sum += current_peak;    // Add the peak to the sum when the hill ends
            current_peak = heights[i];  // Reset the peak for the next hill
        }
    }
    max_sum += current_peak; // Add the peak of the last hill

    out << max_sum;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly sum the heights of the peaks of each hill, yielding the expected output of `22` for the provided input.

The previous solution was still not correctly determining when a hill ends and the next one begins. A hill is defined by a sequence of towers with non-decreasing heights, so the peak of a hill should only be added to the sum when we encounter a tower that is shorter than the previous one, thus ending the current hill.

A correct implementation needs to keep track of the peaks of the hills and add the peak of a hill to the sum only when the current tower is shorter than the previous one, indicating the end of a hill. If the current tower is taller or equal to the previous, it's part of the same hill.

Let's correct the solution and rewrite it:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("deal.in");
    std::ofstream out("deal.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> heights[i];
    }

    long long max_sum = 0;
    int current_peak = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] > current_peak) {
            // If the current height is greater than the current peak, update the peak.
            current_peak = heights[i];
        } else if (heights[i] < current_peak) {
            // If the current height is less than the current peak, the hill ends here.
            // Add the current peak to the sum.
            max_sum += current_peak;
            // Reset the current peak to the current height for the next hill.
            current_peak = heights[i];
        }
        // For equal height, continue with the current hill.
    }

    // Add the last peak to the sum.
    max_sum += current_peak;

    out << max_sum;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly identify the peaks of the hills and yield the expected output of `22` for the provided input.

The problem lies in the misunderstanding of the problem statement and the incorrect implementation of the logic to calculate the sum of the peak heights. We have to consider the peaks of the hills, which occur when we have a non-decreasing sequence (turnuri in ordine crescătoare) that then decreases. The peak is the last tower before the sequence starts to decrease.

Let's review the logic again with the correct understanding:

1. Initialize the sum of peaks to 0.
2. Iterate through the towers, keeping track of the tallest tower (the peak) in the current sequence.
3. When we encounter a tower that is shorter than the previous one, we add the current peak to the sum and start a new sequence with the current tower as the potential new peak.
4. At the end of the iteration, if the last tower is part of a non-decreasing sequence, we add its height to the sum.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("deal.in");
    std::ofstream out("deal.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;
    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> heights[i];
    }

    long long sum_peaks = 0;
    int current_peak = heights[0];

    // Iterate through the towers to find the peaks.
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] < heights[i - 1]) {
            // We have found the end of a non-decreasing sequence.
            sum_peaks += current_peak;
            current_peak = heights[i];
        } else {
            // We are still in a non-decreasing sequence.
            current_peak = std::max(current_peak, heights[i]);
        }
    }

    // Add the peak of the last sequence.
    sum_peaks += current_peak;

    out << sum_peaks;

    return 0;
}
```

The solution now correctly identifies the peaks by ensuring that a peak is only added to the sum when a non-decreasing sequence ends. This should result in the expected output of `22` for the given input.
