Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

Upon evaluating the differences, it's clear that the initial solution does not correctly handle the `>` signs, as it should be building up a descending sequence before encountering a `<`, causing a flush of the descending sequence, starting from the current number going downwards. The `sequence` vector is also incorrectly being indexed and assigned values.

Let's address these issues and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    std::stack<int> s;
    int currentValue = 1;

    fout << N << '\n';

    // Traverse the signs and use a stack to handle the 'greater than' signs
    for (char sign : signs) {
        if (sign == '>') {
            s.push(currentValue);
        } else { // sign is '<'
            fout << currentValue << " ";
            while (!s.empty()) {
                fout << s.top() << " ";
                s.pop();
            }
        }
        currentValue++;
    }

    // Output the remaining elements in the sequence
    fout << currentValue << " ";
    while (!s.empty()) {
        fout << s.top() << " ";
        s.pop();
    }
    fout << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution handles the `>` and `<` signs as intended. When a `>` sign is encountered, it pushes the current value onto a stack, signifying that we have a sequence of descending numbers. When a `<` sign is encountered, it indicates the end of the current descending sequence, so we print the current value and then flush the stack, printing all the values in descending order. Finally, after the loop, we ensure that any remaining values in the stack are outputted to the file, which would occur if the input sequence ended with one or more `>` signs.

The revised solution does not correctly account for the order of the numbers when they are finally flushed from the stack. When we encounter a '<' sign, we should start with printing the largest number that should be in that position, then flush the stack to print numbers in descending order.

Let's fix the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    std::stack<int> stack;
    int currentNum = N;

    fout << N << '\n';

    // Process each sign in the input
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.length(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            stack.push(currentNum); // Put the current number on the stack
        } else {
            fout << currentNum << ' '; // Write the current number
            while (!stack.empty()) { // Flush the stack
                fout << stack.top() << ' ';
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        --currentNum; // Decrement the current number for the next iteration
    }
    fout << currentNum; // The last number in the sequence
    while (!stack.empty()) { // Flush any remaining numbers from the stack
        fout << ' ' << stack.top();
        stack.pop();
    }
    fout << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Now the solution correctly handles the `>` signs by pushing the descending numbers onto the stack. When a `<` sign is encountered, or when we reach the end of the signs, we output the current number and then flush the stack, which outputs the descending numbers in the correct order. The current number is decremented with each iteration, starting from `N` and ending with `1`. This way, we ensure the correct sequence is restored based on the signs.

The output still doesn't match the expected result because the stack is being used incorrectly. We must consider that when a `<` sign is encountered, it ends the current sequence of `>` signs. If we have been reading `>` signs, then the number before the `<` sign must be the smallest in the sequence of descending numbers that comes before it. Therefore, the correct approach is to push the numbers onto the stack when encountering a `>` sign and flush the stack when a `<` sign is found, but the first number to be flushed should be the next value to ensure that the numbers before it are indeed greater.

Let's fix the solution by properly using the stack to keep track of descending sequences and ensuring the correct order when flushing them:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    std::stack<int> stack;
    int value = 1;

    fout << N << '\n';

    // Process each sign in the input
    for (char sign : signs) {
        if (sign == '>') {
            // Push the current value onto the stack when encountering '>'
            stack.push(value);
        } else {
            // Output the current value and flush the stack contents when encountering '<'
            fout << value << ' ';
            while (!stack.empty()) {
                fout << stack.top() << ' ';
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        ++value; // Increment the value for the next iteration
    }

    // Output the last value and flush any remaining stack contents
    fout << value;
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        fout << ' ' << stack.top();
        stack.pop();
    }

    fout << '\n';
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

With this solution, we correctly handle the transitions between `>` and `<` signs, ensuring that the numbers are outputted in descending order after a sequence of `>` signs and in ascending order otherwise. This matches the expected behavior and should produce the correct output for the example provided and other cases as well.

The revised solution still produces incorrect output because it prints the number sequence in ascending order when encountering a `<` sign. However, the correct approach for a sequence of `>` followed by a `<` is to print a descending sequence from the number that comes just after the longest sequence of consecutive `>` symbols, followed by the remaining numbers in ascending order.

Let's fix the solution with the proper logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    std::stack<int> stack;

    // Initialize the output file with the number of elements.
    fout << N << '\n';

    // Use the stack to store the indices where a descending sequence begins.
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '<') {
            // Flush the descending sequence so far.
            while (!stack.empty()) {
                fout << stack.top() << ' ';
                stack.pop();
            }
            // The current number after the descending sequence.
            fout << i + 1 << ' ';
        } else {
            // Push the index of the start of the descending sequence.
            stack.push(i + 1);
        }
    }
    // Flush the last descending sequence, if any.
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        fout << stack.top() << ' ';
        stack.pop();
    }
    // The last number is always N.
    fout << N << '\n';

    // Close the output file.
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this correct solution, the stack keeps track of the numbers at the beginning of a descending sequence. When a `<` sign is reached, the contents of the stack are printed in reverse order (which produces the numbers in descending order), followed by the current number. This resolves the issue and should produce the correct number sequence.

The output is incorrect because the numbers aren't being processed in the correct order. The solution should take into account that the first number to be printed after a sequence of '>' characters is the largest number that has not been printed yet.

When encountering a sequence of '>' characters followed by a '<' or the end of the string, the numbers should be printed starting from the count of '>' characters plus one down to one above the last printed number. Then, the sequence should continue with the smallest number that has not been printed yet.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    std::vector<int> result(N);
    int min_value = 1, max_value = N;

    fout << N << '\n';

    // Start from the end of the signs and decide the values backwards.
    for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (signs[i] == '<') {
            // When the sign is '<', place the min_value and increment it.
            result[i + 1] = min_value++;
        } else {
            // When the sign is '>', place the max_value and decrement it.
            result[i + 1] = max_value--;
        }
    }
    // The first element is the last to be determined.
    result[0] = min_value;

    // Output the result.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fout << result[i] << (i < N - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution works by initially setting `min_value` to 1 and `max_value` to N. We use a vector to store the results and fill it in by looking at the signs from right to left. If the sign is `<`, we assign the current minimum value to the next position and increment the minimum value. If the sign is `>`, we assign the current maximum value to the next position and decrement the maximum value. After the loop, the first position gets the last remaining value. Thus, we reconstruct the sequence that would generate the given pattern of comparisons.

The output is still incorrect because the previous solution was not considering the correct order of the numbers for a series of 'greater than' (>) signs. When we have a series of '>' signs, we should be placing a block of descending numbers that start from the count of '>' signs plus one. After a '<' sign, we should place the smallest number available, which increments each time a '<' sign or the end of the sequence is encountered.

Let's rewrite the solution with a correct algorithm:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    int nextNum = N; // Start from the largest number
    int countGT = 0; // Count of 'greater than' signs

    // Traverse the signs from the end to the start
    for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        // If the current sign is '>', increment countGT
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            countGT++;
        } else {
            // Once we hit a '<' sign or the start of the sequence,
            // output the block of descending numbers.
            for (int j = 0; j <= countGT; ++j) {
                sequence[i + j + 1] = nextNum--;
            }
            countGT = 0; // Reset the count of '>' signs
        }
    }
    // Output any remaining descending sequence at the start
    for (int j = 0; j <= countGT; ++j) {
        sequence[j] = nextNum--;
    }

    // Writing to 'compar.out'
    fout << N << '\n';
    for (int num : sequence) {
        fout << num << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution counts the consecutive '>' signs and then, when a '<' sign or the end of the string is reached, it places the appropriate block of descending numbers into the sequence. It starts placing numbers from N and decreases them as they are placed. The solution ensures the correct descending order for '>' sequences and the lowest available number after a '<' sign.
