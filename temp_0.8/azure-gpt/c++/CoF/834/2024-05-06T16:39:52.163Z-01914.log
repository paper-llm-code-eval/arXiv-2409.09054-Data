Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare.

This code reads the signs from the input file `compar.in`, reconstitutes the sequence, and writes it to the output file `compar.out`. The provided solution uses the `<fstream>` library for file operations, adhering to the constraint of not using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf`. The algorithm used in this solution is optimal for the given problem, as it requires only a single pass through the sign array and instantiates the sequence directly without backtracking or additional processing.

Upon reviewing the provided solution, I see that the logic for assigning values to the sequence based on the signs is incorrect. The original algorithm tried to directly fill in the values from the sequence based on the '>' and '<' signs, but it did not account correctly for the position of the numbers. Specifically, each '>' sign indicates that a peak is reached and then we should decrease the values afterwards, while each '<' indicates that we should have an increasing sequence.

To fix this, we need a different approach. We should keep track of the smallest and largest unused numbers and assign them accordingly based on the signs. When we encounter a '<', we can use the smallest number available, and for a '>', we use the largest number available and then prepare for decreasing numbers if a sequence of '>' follows.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("compar.in");
    ofstream fout("compar.out");

    string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    fout << N << "\n";

    stack<int> decreasing;
    int min_val = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '<') {
            if (!decreasing.empty()) {
                while (!decreasing.empty()) {
                    fout << decreasing.top() << " ";
                    decreasing.pop();
                }
            }
            fout << min_val << " ";
            min_val++;
        } else {  // when signs[i] == '>'
            decreasing.push(min_val);
            min_val++;
        }
    }

    // Flush the remaining values in decreasing order
    decreasing.push(min_val);  // push the last value into the stack
    while (!decreasing.empty()) {
        fout << decreasing.top() << " ";
        decreasing.pop();
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly reconstitute the sequence of numbers based on the input signs. It uses a stack to keep track of the numbers that should be placed in decreasing order, and outputs the numbers in the correct sequence accounting for the pattern of '<' and '>' signs.

Upon reviewing the revised solution and the results, it's clear that the logic for handling the sequence is still not correct. The problem is that when a '>' sign is encountered in the input, we should be ready to write a sequence of numbers in decreasing order, but only after we know how long the sequence of '>' signs continues. This was not handled accurately in the previous solution.

A correct approach is to push the current number onto a stack when a '>' is encountered, and then write from the stack whenever a '<' is encountered, because that indicates the end of a decreasing sequence. At the end of the input, we need to empty the stack to write out the remaining decreasing sequence.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("compar.in");
    ofstream fout("compar.out");

    string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    fout << N << "\n";

    stack<int> s;
    vector<int> sequence;
    int nextNumber = 1;

    for (char sign : signs) {
        if (sign == '<') {
            // When a '<' sign is encountered, output the decreasing sequence first (if any)
            while (!s.empty()) {
                sequence.push_back(s.top());
                s.pop();
            }
            // Then output the next smallest number
            sequence.push_back(nextNumber++);
        } else {
            // Push the next number on the stack to be output later in decreasing order
            s.push(nextNumber++);
        }
    }

    // The last number is always the next smallest number
    sequence.push_back(nextNumber);

    // If there is a decreasing sequence at the end, output it
    while (!s.empty()) {
        sequence.push_back(s.top());
        s.pop();
    }

    for (int num : sequence) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a stack to handle the decreasing sequences correctly. It ensures that all numbers are processed in the right order, with the stack being used to reverse the order of the numbers between '>' signs and the vector `sequence` to store the final sequence. The numbers are output to the file at the end, maintaining the correct order. This should produce the expected output.

I apologize for the oversight. It seems the implementation still didn't produce the correct output. Let's correct the logic.

The sign '>' indicates that the preceding number is greater than the next, and the sign '<' indicates the opposite. A sequence of '>' signs indicates a descending sequence. We need to wait until we reach a '<' sign to determine the length of this descending sequence. One way to handle this is to count the number of '>' signs and then allocate the correct values in descending order starting from the count plus one. When a '<' sign is encountered, we need to output the descending sequence (if any) in reverse order before outputting the next smallest number.

Let's implement the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("compar.in");
    ofstream fout("compar.out");

    string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    fout << N << "\n";

    stack<int> s;
    int nextNumber = N; // Start from the largest number

    for (char sign : signs) {
        if (sign == '<') {
            // If there's a '<', output in ascending order starting from the smallest number
            s.push(nextNumber--);
            while (!s.empty()) {
                fout << s.top() << " ";
                s.pop();
            }
        } else {
            // If there's a '>', just push onto the stack. We'll print them in descending order later.
            s.push(nextNumber--);
        }
    }

    // After the loop, push the last number and output any remaining numbers in descending order
    s.push(nextNumber);
    while (!s.empty()) {
        fout << s.top() << " ";
        s.pop();
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code pushes numbers onto a stack when encountering a '>', which signifies that we need to descend. When we encounter a '<', we print out the numbers on the stack (which will be in ascending order since we're popping from a stack) and then continue. At the end, we print any remaining numbers, which will form the last descending sequence.

This should produce the correct output for any input.

The earlier solutions failed because they either did not accurately handle the sequences of descending numbers or incorrectly tracked the next number to be used. Let's re-evaluate the problem and implement a corrected solution.

For each '>' encountered, we need to remember that there will be a descending sequence. This sequence will end when we encounter a '<' or the end of the sign string. The descending sequence will start from the number representing the length of the continuous '>' sequence plus one and go downwards.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("compar.in");
    ofstream fout("compar.out");

    string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    int current = 1, max_descending_start = N;
    vector<int> sequence(N, 0);
    int desc_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < signs.length(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            desc_count++;
        } else {
            if (desc_count > 0) {
                // We have a sequence of descending numbers to assign
                for (int j = 0; j <= desc_count; ++j) {
                    sequence[i - j] = max_descending_start - j;
                }
                current = max_descending_start + 1; // Reset current starting number
                max_descending_start += desc_count; // Move the max descending start
                desc_count = 0; // Reset descending count
            }
            max_descending_start++;
        }
    }

    // Handle the last descending sequence if it's at the end
    if (desc_count > 0) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= desc_count; ++j) {
            sequence[N - 1 - j] = max_descending_start - j;
        }
    }

    // Handle any numbers that have not been assigned yet
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (sequence[i] == 0) {
            sequence[i] = current++;
        }
    }

    fout << N << "\n";
    for (int num : sequence) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution does the following:

1. It reads the sign string and initializes the variables needed.
2. It iterates over the sign string, counting the number of consecutive '>' characters to determine where descending sequences are located.
3. When a '<' character is encountered or the end is reached, it fills in the descending sequence.
4. After processing the sign string, it assigns any remaining unassigned numbers with the smallest available numbers.
5. It writes the final sequence to the output file.

This should yield the expected output for the input provided and correctly handle other cases.

It looks like the previous solution still contains logical errors, and the implementation is incorrect. Let's clarify and then fix the logic:

1. When we encounter a '<' sign, it indicates the start of an ascending sequence, which means we should assign the smallest possible number that hasn't been used yet.
2. When we encounter a '>' sign, it indicates the start of a descending sequence. However, we don't know the length of this sequence until we encounter a '<' sign or reach the end of the string. Therefore, we should remember the position of the first '>' in a sequence to later fill the values in descending order from that position.

Here's how we can implement this logic correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("compar.in");
    ofstream fout("compar.out");

    string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    fout << N << "\n";

    vector<int> sequence(N);
    int nextNumber = 1; // Next number to use for '<'
    int startPos = -1; // Start of a '>' sequence
    
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '<') {
            // If it's the end of a descending sequence
            if (startPos != -1) {
                // Fill the descending sequence backwards from nextNumber
                for (int j = i; j >= startPos; --j) {
                    sequence[j] = nextNumber++;
                }
                startPos = -1; // Reset the start position
            } else {
                // If it's just a single '<', fill in the next number
                sequence[i] = nextNumber++;
            }
        } else { // signs[i] == '>'
            if (startPos == -1) {
                startPos = i; // Mark the start of a '>' sequence
            }
        }
    }

    // Handle any remaining '>' at the end of the string
    if (startPos != -1) {
        for (int i = N - 1; i >= startPos; --i) {
            sequence[i] = nextNumber++;
        }
    }

    for (int num : sequence) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, we use the vector 'sequence' to store the numbers. We handle the sequences of '<' and '>' signs correctly by tracking the start of '>' sequences and filling in the numbers in ascending order for '<' and in descending order for '>'. This should produce the expected output and solve the problem correctly.

The previous solutions were incorrect because they did not properly handle the '>' and '<' sequences to represent descending and ascending sequences respectively. To fix this, we need to correctly determine the indices where descending sequences begin and end based on the '>' signs and then fill in these sequences with appropriate values in descending order. After that, we fill in the rest of the sequence with ascending numbers where '<' signs are.

Here is the correct algorithm:

1. Iterate through the signs string and identify where descending sequences start (at each '>') and where they end (either at the next '<' or at the end of the string).
2. Use a stack to keep track of the start positions of the descending sequences.
3. Whenever we encounter a '<' sign or reach the end, we pop from the stack and assign decreasing numbers to fill the sequence.
4. We then fill in any remaining positions with the smallest available numbers.

Let's implement this corrected algorithm:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("compar.in");
    ofstream fout("compar.out");

    string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    const int N = signs.length() + 1;
    fout << N << "\n";

    // The sequence will contain the final arrangement of numbers
    vector<int> sequence(N);
    // A stack to maintain the indices where a descending sequence starts
    stack<int> desc_indices;
    // We start by pushing the index 0 as the initial descending sequence start
    desc_indices.push(0);

    // Iterate through the signs to find where descending sequences start
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.length(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            // Continue the descending sequence
            continue;
        }
        else { // signs[i] == '<'
            // Assign numbers to the current descending sequence
            int count = i - desc_indices.top() + 1; // How many numbers to assign
            for (int j = 0; j < count; ++j) {
                sequence[desc_indices.top() + j] = N - j;
            }
            // The next number to assign is N - count
            N -= count;
            
            // Clear the stack and start a new sequence
            while (!desc_indices.empty()) desc_indices.pop();
            
            // Push the current index as the start of the next sequence
            desc_indices.push(i + 1);
        }
    }

    // After processing the signs, assign numbers to the final sequence, if any
    int count = N - desc_indices.top(); // Remaining numbers to assign
    for (int j = 0; j < count; ++j) {
        sequence[desc_indices.top() + j] = N - j;
    }

    // Output the sequence
    for (int num : sequence) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should produce the expected output by correctly interpreting the '>' and '<' signs to construct ascending and descending sequences as required by the problem statement.
