Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

The issue with the previous code is that it is not correctly handling the stack in relation to the current position in the sequence. The logic should be that for each '<' we push the current number to the stack, and for each '>' we pop from the stack and assign those numbers to the corresponding positions in the sequence, but the final number corresponding to the '>' should be placed correctly after the elements that were popped.

Here is the corrected c++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    std::getline(fin, signs);
    int N = signs.length() + 1;

    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    std::stack<int> st;
    int num = 1;
    
    for (char sign : signs) {
        st.push(num++);
        if (sign == '>') {
            while (!st.empty()) {
                sequence[st.size() - 1] = st.top();
                st.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    // Push the last number
    st.push(num++);

    // Pop the remaining elements from the stack
    while (!st.empty()) {
        sequence[st.size() - 1] = st.top();
        st.pop();
    }
    
    // Output the sequence
    fout << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (i > 0) fout << " ";
        fout << sequence[i];
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code first reads the signs from the `compar.in` file into a string. Then it initializes a vector for the sequence and a stack to keep track of the numbers. It iterates through the signs, and when it finds '<', it pushes the next number on the stack. When it finds '>', it pops from the stack and fills the sequence with the numbers that were on the stack. After the loop, it fills in the remaining numbers from the stack (including the last number which is always N). Finally, it writes the length of the sequence and the sequence itself to `compar.out`.

The result differs from the expected result because in the previous code, the sequence is not filled properly when encountering a '>' sign. The logic should have been to keep track of the longest sequence of '<' signs and then write the numbers in descending order from the point at which a '>' sign is encountered. The last number (N), which is the highest, must be placed after all '>' signs have been processed.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    // Read signs from file
    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();
    
    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    int current = N;
    
    // Initial position to start assigning numbers in descending order
    int pos = N - 1;
    
    // Process signs in reverse to assign the largest numbers first
    for (int i = signs.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            // Place the current largest number at the current position
            sequence[pos--] = current--;
        }
    }

    // Place the last number after the last '>'
    sequence[pos] = current--;

    // Now fill in the rest of the numbers in ascending order
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (sequence[i] == 0) {
            sequence[i] = current--;
        }
    }

    // Output the sequence
    fout << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fout << sequence[i];
        if (i < N - 1) {
            fout << " ";
        }
    }
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution processes the signs in reverse order. When a '>' sign is encountered, the next largest number available (starting from N) is placed in the sequence. After processing all '>' signs, the largest number that fits the remaining '<' signs is placed. Finally, the rest of the numbers are filled in ascending order where the sequence elements are zero. This ensures that the sequence of numbers will satisfy the given pattern of '>' and '<' signs. The output is then written to `compar.out` as per the problem statement.

The previous solution still did not produce the correct sequence to match the expected output. The primary issue lies in the way the code assigns numbers to the sequence based on the '>' and '<' pattern given.

Let's analyze the pattern to determine the correct approach:

For each '<' sign, we can delay writing the number because a smaller number should follow it. However, for each '>' sign, we know that the number before must be greater than the number following it, so we can write a sequence of descending numbers for each continuous run of '>' signs encountered.

Let's correct the code with this approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);

    // We use a variable to keep track of the current number to place
    int current = 1;

    // We go through the string of signs and assign the sequence numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '<') {
            sequence[i] = current++;
        } else {
            // If we find a '>', we find how long the chain of '>' is
            int j = i;
            while (j < signs.size() && signs[j] == '>') {
                j++;
            }

            // Now we assign the numbers in descending order from j to i
            for (int k = j; k >= i; --k) {
                sequence[k] = current++;
            }

            // We skip over the chain of '>'
            i = j;
        }
    }

    // Assign the last number which will always be the largest
    sequence[N - 1] = current;

    // Output to the file
    fout << N << '\n';
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (i > 0) fout << ' ';
        fout << sequence[i];
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, when encountering a '<' sign, we can safely assign the current smallest available number. When encountering a '>' sign, we look ahead to find the extent of the '>' chain, then fill in descending numbers for that chain. Lastly, we fill in the last number, which will be the largest number remaining. This should generate a sequence that matches the pattern of '>' and '<' signs as given in the input file and produce the correct output in `compar.out`.

The reason the last solution did not produce the correct output is because it did not handle the sequences of consecutive '>' signs correctly. Upon encountering a '>', the program needs to recognize that a descending sequence should start at the position after the last '>' in that consecutive group, and continue backwards to the current position, filling in the numbers from the current maximum downwards.

Here's the corrected code that implements this logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;

    // We use a stack to keep track of the positions where '<' occurs.
    std::stack<int> positions;
    positions.push(0); // The first position is always the smallest number.

    std::vector<int> sequence(N); // Initialize sequence with N elements.

    // Assign numbers according to the signs.
    for (int i = 0, num = 1; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '<') {
            // Fill in all positions in the stack with increasing numbers.
            while (!positions.empty()) {
                sequence[positions.top()] = num++;
                positions.pop();
            }
            // Push the current position onto the stack.
            positions.push(i + 1); // We use i + 1 because the number after '<' will be at the next index.
        } else { // For '>', just push the position onto the stack to be filled later.
            positions.push(i + 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Fill in the remaining positions in the stack with increasing numbers.
    for (int num = N; !positions.empty(); --num) {
        sequence[positions.top()] = num;
        positions.pop();
    }

    // Output the sequence to the file.
    fout << N << '\n';
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fout << sequence[i] << (i < N - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we use a stack to keep track of the positions that need to be filled in the sequence. Every time we encounter a '<', we fill in all the positions in the stack with increasing numbers since a smaller number should follow '<'. Every time we encounter a '>', we push the position onto the stack because it will need to be filled with a larger number later.

After processing all the signs, we fill in the remaining positions in the stack with the remaining largest numbers in descending order.

Finally, the sequence is written to `compar.out`, and this solution should now correctly match the expected output.

The error message indicates that the `vector` type was being used without including the required header file `<vector>`. To fix this, we need to include the `<vector>` header at the beginning of the program. Similarly, ensure all necessary headers are included to avoid any further compilation errors.

Here is the corrected and complete source code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;

    // We use a stack to keep track of the positions where '<' occurs.
    std::stack<int> positions;
    positions.push(0); // The first position is always the smallest number.

    std::vector<int> sequence(N); // Initialize sequence with N elements.

    // Assign numbers according to the signs.
    for (int i = 0, num = 1; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '<') {
            // Fill in all positions in the stack with increasing numbers.
            while (!positions.empty()) {
                sequence[positions.top()] = num++;
                positions.pop();
            }
            // Push the current position onto the stack.
            positions.push(i + 1); // We use i + 1 because the number after '<' will be at the next index.
        } else { // For '>', just push the position onto the stack to be filled later.
            positions.push(i + 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Fill in the remaining positions in the stack with increasing numbers.
    for (int num = N; !positions.empty(); --num) {
        sequence[positions.top()] = num;
        positions.pop();
    }

    // Output the sequence to the file.
    fout << N << '\n';
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fout << sequence[i] << (i < N - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code includes the `<vector>` header, which defines the `std::vector` type that is used to store the sequence of numbers. It also includes the `<stack>` header for the `std::stack` and the `<fstream>` header for file I/O operations. The logic remains the same as previously described, and this code should now compile successfully and produce the expected output.

The error in the previous code is that it incorrectly assigned numbers to the sequence during the '>' sequence. When numbers should be in descending order, they were being inserted in ascending order instead.

Here's the corrected code, which properly assigns numbers in descending order after a sequence of '>' signs:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("compar.in");
    std::ofstream fout("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    fin >> signs;
    fin.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N, 0); // Initialize sequence with 0s
    std::stack<int> indices; // Stack to track indices for '>' characters

    int number = 1; // Start assigning numbers from 1

    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        indices.push(i); // Push every index onto the stack
        if (signs[i] == '<') { // When '<' is found, assign all stacked indices
            while (!indices.empty()) {
                sequence[indices.top()] = number++;
                indices.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    indices.push(N - 1); // Push the index for the last number
    while (!indices.empty()) { // Assign remaining numbers in descending order
        sequence[indices.top()] = number++;
        indices.pop();
    }

    // Output to the file
    fout << N << '\n';
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (i > 0) fout << ' ';
        fout << sequence[i];
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code pushes every index onto a stack and then, whenever it encounters a '<' sign, it assigns the numbers in ascending order to all indices on the stack. Lastly, it assigns the remaining numbers in ascending order to the indices that are still left on the stack after the loop. This approach correctly accounts for sequences of consecutive '>' signs and ensures that the sequence generated matches the input pattern of '>' and '<' signs. The output is then written to `compar.out` as per the problem statement.
