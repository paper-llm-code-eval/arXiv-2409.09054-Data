This C++ program should solve the given problem efficiently by iterating through all possible values for `a` and calculating the corresponding `c` such that `a, b, c` form a harmonic progression. If the calculated `c` is valid, i.e., it leads to `a, b, c` being in harmonic progression, it's added to the list of results. The output file is then written with the count of results and each pair in the format specified. Note that if `a` and `c` are different, the pair is printed twice, with the order reversed, to represent distinct solutions.

I apologize for the oversight. Upon reviewing the original solution, it seems that there is indeed an issue with the check that determines if a given pair `(a, c)` is in harmonic progression with `b`. Specifically, `c >= a` may not always be a valid check as it might miss out on valid cases where `c < a`.

Let's revisit the formula for finding `c` in terms of `a` and `b`:

\[ c = \frac{2ab}{a+b} \]

Given that `b` is a natural number, for `(a, c)` to be in harmonic progression with `b`, the following must hold true:

\[ a+b \, \text{must divide} \, 2ab \]

We need to iterate only until `a < 2b` since for `a >= 2b`, `c` would not be a positive integer due to the `2a - b` term in the denominator becoming zero or negative, which can't yield a natural number for `c`. Also, we need to check that `a` and `b` are coprime with respect to `2b` to ensure that `c` is a natural number. Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("armonica.out");

    unsigned int b;
    fin >> b;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned int, unsigned int>> results;

    // To ensure a and c are natural numbers, a must not be equal to 2b
    // and must be checked only till a < 2b
    for (unsigned int a = 1; a < 2 * b; ++a) {
        if ((2 * b) % (a + b) == 0) { // a+b must divide 2ab
            unsigned int c = (2 * b * a) / (a + b);
            results.push_back({a, c});
        }
    }

    fout << results.size() << '\n';
    for (const auto &result : results) {
        fout << result.first << ' ' << result.second << '\n';
        if (result.first != result.second) {
            fout << result.second << ' ' << result.first << '\n';
        }
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revision should now properly handle the problem's constraints and requirements, and correctly output the pairs in harmonic progression with `b`. Please note that this solution should be efficient for the given constraints, but it is not the most optimized because it does not consider the coprime condition for `a` and `b`. Nonetheless, it should work correctly for `b <= 1 000 000 000`.

After reviewing my previous solution, it seems that I did not correctly address the previous issue. The previous solution is incorrect because it only includes pairs where `a` is less than `2b`, and it does not account for all the possible valid `c` values that can pair with `a` to give the harmonic mean `b`. As a result, some valid solutions are missing.

Let's correct this and write a new solution. The correct approach is to iterate over all possible `a` values such that `a >= b` and for each `a`, check if it results in a valid integer `c` that forms a harmonic progression. Since `a` and `c` are interchangeable, we only need to iterate `a` up to the value of `b` to avoid double counting. Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("armonica.out");

    unsigned int b;
    fin >> b;
    fin.close();

    unsigned int count = 0;
    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned int, unsigned int>> results;

    // Start from b to avoid division by zero and double counting
    for (unsigned int a = b; a <= 2 * b; ++a) { 
        unsigned long long numerator = 2ull * a * b;
        unsigned long long denominator = a + b;
        // Check if c is a natural number (integer) and a does not equal b
        if (numerator % denominator == 0) {
            unsigned int c = static_cast<unsigned int>(numerator / denominator);
            // No need to check for c >= a as we start from b and go up
            results.push_back({a, c});
            count++;
            // If a is not equal to c, then we have another pair (c, a)
            if (a != c) {
                results.push_back({c, a});
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write results to file
    fout << count << '\n';
    for (const auto &result : results) {
        fout << result.first << ' ' << result.second << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution ensures that we consider all possible `a` values such that `a >= b` and thus find all pairs `(a, c)` that form a harmonic progression with `b`. The code uses 64-bit unsigned integers (`unsigned long long`) for the intermediate multiplication to avoid overflow issues. This solution should now match the expected output.

My previous solution still did not capture all valid pairs `(a, c)` that form a harmonic progression with `b`. The problem lies in using the range from `b` to `2 * b` for iterating over `a`. This approach misses some valid pairs and includes invalid ones. The correct approach is to iterate over all possible values of `a` and calculate the corresponding `c` using the harmonic mean formula, ensuring that `(a, c)` are natural numbers and that `c` is greater than or equal to `a` to avoid duplicates.

Here is the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("armonica.out");

    unsigned int b;
    fin >> b;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned int, unsigned int>> results;

    // Iterate over all possible values of a
    for (unsigned int a = 1; a <= b; ++a) {
        unsigned long long numerator = 2ull * a * b;
        unsigned long long denominator = a + b;

        // Check if denominator divides the numerator (c is a natural number)
        if (numerator % denominator == 0) {
            unsigned int c = static_cast<unsigned int>(numerator / denominator);
            if (c >= a) { // Ensure c is greater or equal to a to avoid duplicates
                results.push_back({a, c});
            }
        }
    }

    // Additional pairs can be found by iterating over c values greater than b
    for (unsigned int c = b + 1; c <= 2 * b - 1; ++c) {
        unsigned long long numerator = 2ull * b * c;
        unsigned long long denominator = b + c;

        // Check if denominator divides the numerator (a is a natural number)
        if (numerator % denominator == 0) {
            unsigned int a = static_cast<unsigned int>(numerator / denominator);
            if (a < b) { // a must be less than b to avoid duplicates
                results.push_back({a, c});
            }
        }
    }

    // Write results to file
    fout << results.size() << '\n';
    for (const auto &result : results) {
        fout << result.first << ' ' << result.second << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution now checks for pairs `(a, c)` such that `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and then it checks for pairs `(a, c)` where `c` is greater than `b` and less than `2 * b`. By checking both these ranges separately, we cover all possible pairs without duplication. This solution should now produce the expected output.

My apologies, the previous solutions still did not solve the task correctly. The correct approach is to iterate over potential values of `a` and calculate `c` for each `a` using the harmonic mean formula. Since we need all pairs `(a, c)` where `b` is the harmonic mean, and given the formula:

\[ b = \frac{2ac}{a + c} \]

We can rearrange it to solve for `c`:

\[ c = \frac{ab}{2b - a} \]

Now, we should only consider `a` values where `2b - a > 0`, which simplifies to `a < 2b`. We also need to ensure that `ab` is divisible by `2b - a` to get a natural number for `c`.

Below is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("armonica.out");

    unsigned int b;
    fin >> b;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned int, unsigned int>> results;

    for (unsigned int a = 1; a < 2 * b; ++a) {
        if ((a != b) && ((b * a) % (2 * b - a) == 0)) {
            unsigned int c = (b * a) / (2 * b - a);
            if (c >= a) { // c should be greater than or equal to a to avoid duplicates
                results.push_back(std::make_pair(a, c));
            }
        }
    }

    fout << results.size() << '\n';
    for (const auto &pair : results) {
        fout << pair.first << ' ' << pair.second << '\n';
        if (pair.first != pair.second) {  // If a and c are not the same, print the reversed pair
            fout << pair.second << ' ' << pair.first << '\n';
        }
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates through the appropriate range of `a` values and checks if the computed `c` forms a valid harmonic progression with `b`. If so, it adds the pair `(a, c)` to the results. It also ensures to output each distinct pair, taking into account that `(a, c)` and `(c, a)` are considered different if `a` is not equal to `c`. The solution should now produce the expected output.

I apologize for the continued errors. Let's correct the solution. To find all natural number pairs `(a, c)` that are in harmonic progression with `b`, we need to ensure that `2ac = b(a + c)`. This can be rearranged to `2ac = ab + bc`, and further to `ac - ab = bc`, which simplifies to `a(c - b) = bc`. From this, we can solve for `c` as follows: `c = bc / (a - b)`.

We need to iterate over all `a` such that `a != b` and `a - b` divides `bc` without remainder to ensure that `c` is a natural number. We'll start iterating from `a = 1` up to a value that would make `c` less than `a`, to avoid duplicates and considering the symmetry of the pairs `(a, c)` and `(c, a)`.

Here's the updated and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("armonica.out");

    unsigned int b;
    fin >> b;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned int, unsigned int>> results;

    // Iterate over possible values of a to find corresponding values of c
    for (unsigned int a = 1; a < 2 * b; ++a) {
        if (a != b && (b * b) % (a - b) == 0) {  // Check if a - b divides b * b
            unsigned int c = (b * b) / (a - b);
            if (c > a) {  // Ensure c > a to prevent duplicates
                results.push_back(std::make_pair(a, c));
            }
        }
    }

    fout << results.size() << '\n';

        fout << pair.first << ' ' << pair.second << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code iterates through valid `a` values, calculates `c`, and checks if `c` is a natural number. It avoids duplication by ensuring that `c` is greater than `a`. The output file should now contain the correct number of pairs and the correct pairs themselves, as per the expected output.

I apologize for the repeated inaccuracies in previous attempts. Let's re-evaluate the approach to ensure correctness.

We have the condition:

\[ b = \frac{2ac}{a + c} \]

This can be rearranged to solve for `c`:

\[ c = \frac{ab}{2b - a} \]

Given `b`, we should find all `a` such that `(a - b)` divides `(ab)`, and `2b - a` is non-zero (to avoid division by zero). `a` must be less than `2b` for `c` to be positive. 

We need to iterate over `a` starting from 1 to some upper limit, ensuring that `c` calculated from each `a` is a natural number and that we don't duplicate pairs (`(a,c)` is the same as `(c,a)`). Since we only want non-duplicate and natural number pairs, `a` should start from 1 and go up to `b` (since for `a > b`, `c` will be less than `b`, which would be a duplication).

Here is the correct implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("armonica.out");

    unsigned int b;
    fin >> b;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned int, unsigned int>> results;

    // Iterate over possible values of a to find corresponding values of c
    for (unsigned int a = 1; a <= b; ++a) {
        if ((2 * b - a) != 0 && (a * b) % (2 * b - a) == 0) { // Check if a - b divides a * b
            unsigned int c = (a * b) / (2 * b - a);
            if (a <= c) { // Ensure a <= c to prevent duplicates
                results.push_back({a, c});
            }
        }
    }

    fout << results.size() << '\n';
    for (const auto &pair : results) {
        fout << pair.first << ' ' << pair.second << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution iterates over valid values of `a`, calculates `c`, and ensures that `c` is a natural number without duplication. The condition `a <= c` prevents us from writing the same pair twice. This solution should now match the expected output.
