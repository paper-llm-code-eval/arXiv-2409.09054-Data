Mihai a primit de ziua lui un joc de puzzle. Jocul are $N$ piese confecționate prin lipirea unor bucăți de dimensiune $1 \cdot 1$ (ilustrate în figurile de mai jos prin `X`); aceste bucăți le vom numi în continuare, pe scurt, `X`-uri. Pentru confecționarea unei piese se respectă următoarele reguli:

* `X`-urile sunt așezate unul peste altul, formând coloane ce pot avea înălțimi diferite, apoi coloanele se aliniază în partea de jos și se lipesc între ele, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta;
* Pe o coloană sunt cel mult $9$ `X`-uri;
* Toate piesele au același număr de coloane.

~[puzzle.jpg|align=center]

În figurile $1, 2, 3, 4$ sunt piese de puzzle care respectă regulile descrise, iar în figura $5$ și în figura $6$ **NU** sunt piese de puzzle, pentru că nu pot fi obținute prin lipirea unor coloane de $X$-uri, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta.
Fiind mic, Mihai nu poate rezolva puzzle-ul, dar poate face o singură operație: alege două piese și le îmbină în dreptul laturilor de sus, răsturnând una dintre piese sus-jos (fără să o rotească sau să o răstoarne stânga-dreapta). Dacă în urma acestei operații el obține un dreptunghi format din coloane complete de $X$-uri, toate coloanele având aceeași înălțime, este mulțumit. De exemplu, piesa din figura $1$ și cea din figura $2$ pot fi îmbinate în modul descris.
În figura $7$ este piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos. În figura $8$ este ilustrat dreptunghiul care se obține din piesa din figura $1$ și piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos.
Observați că, dacă am roti piesa din figura $4$, am putea să o îmbinăm cu piesa din figura $1$, dar rotația nu este permisă.
Vom codifica o piesă printr-un număr natural, fiecare cifră din număr reprezentând (în ordine de la stânga la dreapta) câte $X$-uri se află pe coloana corespunzătoare din piesă.
De exemplu:
- piesa din figura $1$ este codificată $4232$;
- piesa din figura $2$ este codificată $1323$;
- piesa din figura $3$ este codificată $4444$;
- piesa din figura $4$ este codificată $3231$.

# Cerință

Determinați care este numărul de moduri în care Mihai poate alege câte două piese dintre cele $N$ pentru a face o operație în modul descris mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `puzzle.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă numărul de piese din joc. Pe linia a doua se găsesc $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, reprezentând codificările celor $N$ piese.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `puzzle.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris numărul cerut.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$;
* Numerele care reprezintă codificările pieselor au același număr de cifre (cel mult $5$) și nu conțin cifra $0$.
* Într-o operație nu contează care dintre piese este răsturnată, ca urmare perechea formată din piesa $a$ și piesa $b$ este considerată ca fiind aceeași cu perechea formată din piesa $b$ și piesa $a$.
* Dreptunghiul obținut în urma unei operații poate avea înălțimea mai mare decât $9$.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $N \leq 1 \ 000$.

This C++ code should solve the problem efficiently by counting the number of ways two pieces can be combined to form a rectangle, as described in the challenge. It uses a hash map to keep track of the count of each sum of the digits, which represents the height of the flipped piece. Then it finds pairs that can make up the maximum height together.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it is clear that the initial implementation has a logical issue in the way it handles the calculation of pairs. In the initial implementation, for each sum of digits found in the `countMap`, it looks for a complement that sums up to the `maxHeight`. However, this is incorrect because the complement should sum up to the maximum possible column height, which is 9, due to the given condition that on a column there are at most 9 `X`s. Furthermore, it incorrectly sets the count of the complement to 0, which may remove valid pairs.

The correct approach is to calculate the complement with respect to 9 for each column. Since the maximum possible height for a single column is 9, the sum of the heights for any two pieces being combined should not exceed 9 for each column.

Let's correct the implementation by calculating the complement with respect to 9 for each column. We will also ensure that we do not count the same pair twice by only counting pairs one way and avoiding the double count.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream out("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    // Since all pieces have the same number of columns, we can determine it by the first piece.
    std::string firstPiece;
    in >> firstPiece;
    int columns = firstPiece.size();

    // Vector to store counts of pieces by their complement to 9 per column
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> complements(10, std::vector<int>(columns, 0));

    // Process the first piece separately
    for (int j = 0; j < columns; ++j) {
        int number = firstPiece[j] - '0';
        complements[9 - number][j]++;
    }

    // Process the remaining pieces
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        std::string piece;
        in >> piece;
        for (int j = 0; j < columns; ++j) {
            int number = piece[j] - '0';
            complements[9 - number][j]++;
        }
    }
    in.close();

    long long pairs = 0;
    // Calculate the pairs for each column
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < columns; ++j) {
            // Avoid double counting by only pairing with a higher complement
            for (int k = i + 1; k <= 9; ++k) {
                pairs += static_cast<long long>(complements[i][j]) * complements[k][j];
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the result
    out << pairs << std::endl;
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This new implementation calculates for each column the count of pieces that, when flipped, would complement another piece to make the column a height of 9. It then counts the number of possible combinations without double-counting by ensuring that each pair is counted once. This fixes the logical error in the initial implementation and should produce the expected output.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly attempts to match each column independently, whereas we need to consider the entire piece as a single unit. For two pieces to be combined into a rectangle, their corresponding columns, when summed up, should not exceed the height of 9 for every column.

To fix this, instead of storing counts of complements per column, we should store the count of complements for the entire piece. That is, we calculate the complement to 9 for the entire piece and store it in a hash map. Then, we can count the pairs by finding pieces that, when combined, would sum to 9 in every column (i.e., their complements match perfectly).

Let's correct the implementation and ensure that we consider each piece as a whole:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream out("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    // Map to store the counts of the complement of the piece
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> complementMap;
    long long pairs = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::string piece, complementPiece;
        in >> piece;
        // Calculate the complement piece which would sum to 9 for every column
        for (char digit : piece) {
            complementPiece += ('9' - digit + '0');
        }
        // If the complement piece is already in the map, it can form a valid pair
        pairs += complementMap[complementPiece];
        // Increment the count of the current piece's complement in the map
        complementMap[complementPiece]++;
    }
    in.close();

    // Write the result
    out << pairs << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation considers each piece's complement as a whole and counts the occurrences of such complements. When a new piece is read, we check how many times its complement has occurred before (since those are the pieces it can pair with). This should provide the correct output, matching the expected result.

The previous solution is still incorrect because it attempts to find the complement of each piece that would sum up to 9 for every column. This approach does not work because we need to find pairs of pieces that, when combined (with one piece flipped upside down), fill up to the maximum column height of any piece (which is not necessarily 9). 

The maximum column height of any piece is the height we need to fill up to, by combining the columns of two pieces such that the combined height of corresponding columns is equal for all columns. The complement is not with respect to 9 but with respect to the maximum column height for that particular piece.

Let's correct the implementation by first determining the maximum column height of each piece and then finding pairs of pieces that can be combined to match this height:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Utility function to get the complement
std::string getComplement(const std::string& piece, int maxHeight) {
    std::string complement;
    for (char ch: piece) {
        complement += std::to_string(maxHeight - (ch - '0'));
    }
    return complement;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream out("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    // Read all pieces into a vector
    std::vector<std::string> pieces(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> pieces[i];
    }
    in.close();

    long long pairs = 0;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> complementCounts;

    // Iterate through all pieces
    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        // Determine the maximum height for this piece
        int maxHeight = 0;
        for (char digit : piece) {
            maxHeight = std::max(maxHeight, digit - '0');
        }

        // Get the complement for this piece
        std::string complement = getComplement(piece, maxHeight);

        // Increment the pairs count by the number of times this complement has been seen
        pairs += complementCounts[complement];

        // Increment the complement count for this piece
        complementCounts[getComplement(piece, maxHeight)]++;
    }

    // Write the result
    out << pairs << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, we go through each piece and calculate its complement with respect to its maximum height. We then use a hash map to keep track of the counts of complements we have seen. When we see a piece, we increment the pairs count by the number of times we have previously seen its complement. This will correctly count the number of ways that Mihai can combine pieces to make the desired rectangle.

The previous solution still incorrectly finds the complement based on the maximum height of the individual piece, but that's not how the puzzle pieces combine. The correct method is to pair two pieces such that when one is flipped upside down, the heights of their corresponding columns add up to the same value for all columns. The complement is not specific to each piece but is based on the maximum height that can be achieved when any two pieces are combined.

To achieve this, we must first calculate the maximum possible height for a single column when any two pieces are combined. This is 9, because there can be at most 9 `X`s on a column, as stated in the problem description. Once we know this, we can calculate the complement for each piece based on this maximum height and pair pieces accordingly.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct method of finding piece complements:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream out("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    // Store the counts of the heights
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> heightCount;

    // Read all pieces
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::string piece;
        in >> piece;
        std::string complement(piece.size(), '0'); // Initialize complement string

        // Calculate complement based on the max height 9 for each column
        for (size_t j = 0; j < piece.size(); ++j) {
            complement[j] = '0' + (9 - (piece[j] - '0')); // Get complement for each column
        }

        // Increment count for both the piece and its complement
        heightCount[complement]++;
    }
    in.close();

    // Count the number of pairs
    long long pairs = 0;
    for (const auto& pair : heightCount) {
        // Each pair can be combined in two ways (flipping either piece),
        // so n * (n - 1) accounts for both directions, but we divide by 2
        // to avoid double counting since flipping both pieces gives the same result.
        pairs += (long long)(pair.second) * (pair.second - 1) / 2;
    }

    // Write the result
    out << pairs << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we map each piece to its complement that would sum to 9 for each column. Then, we count all combinations of the pieces that can be paired together (where the count of a piece is greater than 1). For each piece complement, the number of pairings is the count of pieces that can be paired with it, which is calculated as `n * (n - 1) / 2` where `n` is the count of such pieces. This should give us the correct number of pairings that Mihai can make.

The provided solution is incorrect because it assumes we're looking for pairs of identical pieces that complement each other to form a solid rectangle, but the actual task is to find distinct pairs of pieces that can combine to form a rectangle, considering the inversion of one piece. The previous solution calculated the complement wrong, since the maximum height of the entire rectangle is not necessarily 9 but should be determined by the pieces themselves.

To fix the solution, we need to:

1. Find the total height that the pieces need to fill, which is the maximum column height among all pieces.
2. For each piece, calculate its "complement" based on this total height.
3. Use a map to count how many times each "complement" occurs.
4. For each piece, find its "complement" in the map, and for every occurrence of this "complement," we have a valid pairing (except when the piece and its "complement" are the same).

Let's rewrite the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream out("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    // Store the pieces and their maximum heights
    std::vector<std::string> pieces(N);
    int totalHeight = 0; // This will store the max height among all columns of all pieces

    // Read all pieces and find the maximum column height
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> pieces[i];
        for (char digit : pieces[i]) {
            totalHeight = std::max(totalHeight, digit - '0'); // Update max column height
        }
    }
    in.close();

    // Map to store the counts of the "inverse" heights
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> inverseHeightCount;

    // Count the "inverse" heights
    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        std::string inverseHeight = piece;
        for (char& digit : inverseHeight) {
            digit = (totalHeight - (digit - '0')) + '0'; // Calculate the inverse height for each column
        }
        inverseHeightCount[inverseHeight]++;
    }

    // Count the number of valid pairs
    long long pairs = 0;
    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        std::string inverseHeight = piece;
        for (char& digit : inverseHeight) {
            digit = (totalHeight - (digit - '0')) + '0'; // Calculate the inverse height for each column
        }
        if (inverseHeightCount[inverseHeight] > 0) {
            if (inverseHeight == piece) {
                // When the piece is equal to its inverse, we should only count the combinations once
                pairs += (inverseHeightCount[inverseHeight] - 1);
            } else {
                pairs += inverseHeightCount[inverseHeight];
            }
        }
    }

    // We've counted each pair twice (once for each piece), so divide by 2
    pairs /= 2;

    // Write the result
    out << pairs << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we iterate through all the pieces twice. In the first pass, we calculate the maximum possible height a rectangle can have and count how many times each inverse height appears in the given set of pieces. In the second pass, we find valid pairings for each piece based on the inverse heights we've counted. We count the pairs, adjusting for cases where the piece is equal to its inverse and ensure that we don't double-count the pairs. This should give us the correct number of valid pairings.

The previous solutions do not take into account the correct logic for combining two puzzle pieces. The task is to combine any two pieces in such a way that flipping one of them upside down will result in all columns forming a perfect rectangle, meaning the heights of the corresponding columns from the two pieces must add up to the same total height.

To solve the problem correctly, we should follow these steps:
1. Read all the puzzle piece heights into an array.
2. For each piece, calculate the "complement" needed to form a full rectangle when combined with another piece. The complement is calculated by subtracting the height of each column from the maximum allowable height (9 in this case).
3. Store each piece's complement in a map and count the occurrences.
4. When the complement of a piece is equal to any other piece itself (not its complement), we can form a valid pair.
5. Count all the valid pairs.

Let's write the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream out("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    in >> N;

    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> pieceCounts; // To count occurrences of each piece
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> complementCounts; // To count occurrences of each complement
    std::string piece;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        in >> piece;
        pieceCounts[piece]++;

        // Calculate the complement of the current piece (what's needed to reach height 9)
        std::string complement;
        for (char digit : piece) {
            complement += ('9' - digit) + '0';
        }
        complementCounts[complement]++;
    }
    in.close();

    // Count the number of valid pairs
    long long pairs = 0;
    for (const auto &entry : pieceCounts) {
        // A valid pair is formed when a piece's complement is another piece
        pairs += static_cast<long long>(entry.second) * complementCounts[entry.first];
    }

    // Since each pair is counted twice (once for each piece), divide by 2
    pairs /= 2;

    // Write the result
    out << pairs << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we use two maps: one to count the occurrences of each piece and another to count the occurrences of each complement. Then we iterate through the piece counts and for each piece, we multiply its count by the count of its complement in the complementCounts map. Finally, we divide the total count by 2 to correct for the fact that we've counted each pair twice. This solution should yield the correct number of valid pairings.
