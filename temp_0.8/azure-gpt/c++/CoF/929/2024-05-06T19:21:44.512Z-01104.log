În clasa lui *Dexter* sunt $N$ elevi de înălțimi distincte. La ora de sport, ei sunt așezați în linie, de la stânga la dreapta. Profesorul lor, *Johnny*, va selecta pentru un exercițiu elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive în linie, astfel încât cel mai înalt elev dintre cei selectați să se afle în prima jumătate a acestora.

De exemplu, dacă elevii au, în ordine, înălțimile $1$, $5$, $4$, atunci profesorul poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $5$ și $4$, dar nu poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $1$ și $5$. Desigur, există mai multe moduri de a selecta elevii astfel încât să fie satisfăcută condiția de mai sus. Profesorul *Johnny* ar vrea să afle în câte moduri se poate face acest lucru.

# Cerinţă
Dându-se $N$ și înălțimile elevilor din clasă, aflați în câte moduri pot fi selectați oricâți elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive, astfel încât să fie îndeplinită condiția din enunț.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `leftmax.in` conține, pe prima linie, numărul $N$, iar pe a doua linie înălțimile elevilor în ordinea în care sunt așezați în linie.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `leftmax.out` conține pe prima linie răspunsul la cerință, sub formă de rest al împărțirii la $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ ($\text{modulo }1\ 000\ 000\ 007$).

# Restricţii și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Înălțimea oricărui elev este un număr întreg cuprins între $1$ și $N$, inclusiv.
- Dacă se selectează un număr impar de elevi, atunci considerăm că cel din mijlocul selecției se află în prima jumătate a elevilor selectați.
- Pentru 10 puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$ și elevii sunt ordonați descrescător după înălțime.
- Pentru alte 35 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru alte 20 de puncte, $N \leq 30\ 000$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here's an optimal C++ solution for the given problem:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("leftmax.in");
    std::ofstream fout("leftmax.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }
    
    // Use a stack to maintain a strictly decreasing sequence of heights
    std::stack<int> s;
    long long count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // Calculate possible selections where the current element is the max
        // and is in the first half
        while (!s.empty() && heights[s.top()] < heights[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        count += s.size();
        count %= MOD;
        s.push(i);
    }

    fout << count << '\n';
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- We read the number of students (N) and their heights from the `leftmax.in` file.
- We use a stack (s) to keep track of indices in a strictly decreasing order of height.
- For each student, we pop elements from the stack until we find one that is taller, ensuring the current student is the tallest in the selection and is in the first half. The size of the stack at this point gives us the number of valid selections ending at the current student.
- We keep a running count of valid selections, taking care of the modulo operation as required.
- The final count is written to `leftmax.out`.

This algorithm runs in O(N) time since each index is pushed onto and popped from the stack at most once. It is optimal in terms of time complexity.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it seems that the initial solution does not correctly count all valid selections. The issue lies in the logic that determines the number of valid selections for a given element.

In the initial solution, the algorithm only considers the nearest taller element to the left as the starting point of a valid selection. However, the problem statement allows selecting any number of consecutive students as long as the tallest among them is in the first half, which includes the case where the current student can be the only one selected.

Let's fix the solution to correctly count the number of ways the students can be selected according to the problem statement:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("leftmax.in");
    std::ofstream fout("leftmax.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }

    long long count = 0;
    std::vector<int> stack; // Use a vector to simulate a stack.

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // Maintain the conditions for the stack and pop elements that are not higher.
        while (!stack.empty() && heights[stack.back()] <= heights[i]) {
            stack.pop_back();
        }
        // Count the number of ways to select consecutive students.
        // The current element being the highest and in the first half.
        int validLeft = stack.empty() ? 0 : stack.back() + 1;
        count += (i - validLeft + 1);
        count %= MOD;
        stack.push_back(i);
    }

    fout << count << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- We use a vector `stack` to simulate a stack to keep track of indices in a non-increasing order of height.
- For each student at index `i`, we pop elements from the stack while the top element of the stack is not taller than the current student's height.
- The `validLeft` variable represents the index of the nearest taller student to the left or `0` if there is no taller student to the left.
- The number of valid selections for the current student is `i - validLeft + 1`, which includes the current student being selected alone or with any number of consecutive shorter students to the left.
- We add this number to our running `count` and apply the modulo operation.
- Finally, we push the index of the current student onto the stack.

This revised solution should produce the correct output and respect the problem constraints.

Upon reviewing the differences between the expected and found output, it is clear that the revised solution still fails to consider all valid sequences. The solution correctly tracks the nearest taller student to the left, but it does not account for the condition that the tallest student in any valid selection must be in the first half of that selection.

To fix this issue, we need to modify our approach. For each student, we will count the number of valid sequences ending with that student as the tallest and being in the first half. This means we need to consider both even and odd length sequences ending at the current student's position.

Let's implement a corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("leftmax.in");
    std::ofstream fout("leftmax.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }

    // We use a stack to maintain indices of the heights in non-increasing order.
    std::stack<int> s;
    long long result = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // Pop elements from the stack that are not taller than the current height.
        while (!s.empty() && heights[s.top()] < heights[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }

        // If the stack is not empty, we can form valid sequences with the current height as the tallest.
        // The number of such sequences is equal to the number of elements between the top of the stack and the current index.
        if (!s.empty()) {
            int lastIndex = s.top();

            // Calculate sequences of even length by dividing the distance by 2
            int evenLengthSequences = (i - lastIndex) / 2;
            result = (result + evenLengthSequences) % MOD;

            // Calculate sequences of odd length by dividing the distance by 2 and adding 1
            int oddLengthSequences = ((i - lastIndex) + 1) / 2;
            result = (result + oddLengthSequences) % MOD;
        } else {
            // If the stack is empty, all subsequences ending in this element are valid,
            // and the number of such subsequences is the index of the current element divided by 2 (for even length)
            // plus the index of the current element divided by 2 plus 1 (for odd length).
            int evenLengthSequences = (i + 1) / 2;
            result = (result + evenLengthSequences) % MOD;

            int oddLengthSequences = (i + 2) / 2;
            result = (result + oddLengthSequences) % MOD;
        }

        // Push the current index onto the stack.
        s.push(i);
    }

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- The stack maintains indices of students in non-increasing order of height.
- We iterate over each student's height and pop from the stack until we find a taller student.
- If the stack isn't empty, that means we found a taller student previously. The current student can form valid subsequences of even and odd lengths with all students between the taller student and the current student.
- If the stack is empty, the current student is the tallest so far, and all possible subsequences up to the current student are valid.
- We use modular arithmetic to ensure the result stays within the required bounds.
- The corrected solution accounts for both even and odd length subsequences and should now produce the expected output.

It appears that the previous solutions misunderstood the problem, leading to incorrect results. The correct approach should consider any sequence of consecutive students where the tallest student is within the first half of the selection. This includes selections of just one student.

We need to adjust the logic to ensure we're counting all possible selections. Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("leftmax.in");
    std::ofstream fout("leftmax.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<int> heights(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> heights[i];
    }

    std::stack<int> decreasing_heights;
    long long ways = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // Pop elements smaller than the current height to ensure the tallest is on the left half
        while (!decreasing_heights.empty() && heights[decreasing_heights.top()] <= heights[i]) {
            decreasing_heights.pop();
        }

        // If the stack is not empty, there is a taller student to the left
        if (!decreasing_heights.empty()) {
            int left_bound = decreasing_heights.top(); // The last taller student's index
            // We can form valid selections starting anywhere from left_bound + 1 to i (inclusive)
            int valid_selections = i - left_bound;
            ways += valid_selections;
        } else {
            // If the stack is empty, we can form valid selections starting from the beginning to i (inclusive)
            ways += i + 1; // All positions from 0 to i are valid starting points
        }

        // Every single student is also a valid selection by themselves
        ways++;

        ways %= MOD; // Apply the modulo after each addition
        decreasing_heights.push(i); // Push the current index to the stack
    }

    fout << ways << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- We iterate through each student and maintain a stack that keeps indices of students in strictly decreasing order of heights.
- For each student, we remove from the stack those who are not taller (breaking the condition for the tallest in the first half).
- The valid selections are counted as sequences starting from one position past the previous taller student to the current student's position, inclusive.
- We also count the current student as a valid selection by themselves.
- The result is taken modulo 1,000,000,007 as per the problem statement.
- Finally, the total count is written to the output file.

This solution should now yield the correct count of 8 for the provided input.
