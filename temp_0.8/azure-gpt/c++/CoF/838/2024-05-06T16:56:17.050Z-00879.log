Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.

}
```

This solution uses the following approaches:

- For the first part, it calculates the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) using a greedy method with binary search (std::lower_bound), which gives us the minimal number of strictly increasing subsequences that can partition `S`.
- For the second part, it uses a dynamic programming technique to calculate the number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k`. It iterates through the numbers and updates a rolling array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the number of sequences ending at the current position with a sum that is equivalent to `i` modulo `k`.

The solution uses file streams for input and output as requested.

Please note that the actual performance of this code highly depends on the compiler optimizations and the hardware it runs on. However, the algorithmic complexity of the solution is optimized to deal with the constraints given in the problem statement.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there is a bug in the second part of the solution, which handles counting the number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k`. The first part of the solution seems to be working fine as it correctly identified the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences as `4`.

The bug appears to be within the `countSequences` function. In the provided solution, the dynamic programming array `dp` should be 2-dimensional to keep track of sequences ending at each position with a sum corresponding to each modulo `k`. However, the current implementation uses a 1-dimensional array, which fails to track the sequences properly as it overwrites the counts when iterating backward.

Here is the corrected solution, which maintains a prefix sum array and counts the number of sequences whose sum modulo `k` is the same at each position:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

const int MOD = 20011;

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int minSubsequences(const std::vector<int>& s) {
    std::vector<int> lis;
    for (int i : s) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), i);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(i);
        } else {
            *it = i;
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int countSequences(const std::vector<int>& s, int k) {
    std::vector<int> count(k, 0);
    count[0] = 1;
    int sum = 0;
    int sequences = 0;

    for (int num : s) {
        sum = (sum + num) % k;
        sequences = (sequences + count[sum]) % MOD;
        count[sum] = (count[sum] + 1) % MOD;
    }

    return sequences;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int& num : s) {
        fin >> num;
    }

    fout << minSubsequences(s) << '\n';
    fout << countSequences(s, k) << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution maintains a prefix sum modulo `k` and counts the number of times each residue occurs up to each position. It then adds the count of the current residue to the total number of sequences, effectively counting the number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k`.

This fixes the bug and should produce the correct result.

Upon reviewing the previous message, it appears to have a mistake. The found output `4 23` actually matches the expected output exactly. Therefore, the corrected code does not have a discrepancy with the expected result, and there is no need to look for differences or provide an explanation since the results align.

However, there may have been a confusion in the message about the output of the corrected solution. To clarify, the corrected solution provided in the last response is expected to produce the correct output, which matches the expected output provided in the challenge:

Expected output:
```
4 
23
```

Corrected solution output:
```
4
23
```

There is no difference between the expected output and the found output with the corrected solution, so no further fixes are required. The corrected solution is already accurate and meets the challenge's requirements.

---------- assistant ----------

The error message indicates that there's a compilation issue with the program, where the compiler is expecting an unqualified identifier but found a numeric constant `4` at the beginning of the file. This is likely due to a mistake in copying the code or an accidental change that added the number `4` at the start of the file.

To fix this issue, it's essential to ensure that the source code begins with proper C++ syntax without any misplaced numbers or symbols. Below, I will provide the entire corrected source code without any such errors.

Here is the entire fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 20011;

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int minSubsequences(const std::vector<int>& s) {
    std::vector<int> lis; // Longest Increasing Subsequence helper
    for (int value : s) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), value);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(value);
        } else {
            *it = value;
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int countSequences(const std::vector<int>& s, int k) {
    std::vector<int> dp(k, 0); // Dynamic programming array
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: one empty sequence
    int sum = 0;
    for (int value : s) {
        sum = (sum + value) % k;
        for (int j = k - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
            dp[(j + value) % k] = (dp[(j + value) % k] + dp[j]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    return (dp[0] - 1 + MOD) % MOD; // Excluding the empty sequence and ensuring non-negative result
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int& value : s) {
        fin >> value;
    }

    fout << minSubsequences(s) << '\n';
    fout << countSequences(s, k) << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now compile and execute correctly, provided there are no other syntax errors or issues with the code. It addresses both parts of the programming challenge using efficient algorithms: a greedy approach with binary search for the first part and a dynamic programming approach for the second part.

The provided solution seems to correctly solve the first part of the challenge, which is to find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences within a sequence. However, the second part, which involves counting the number of subsequences whose sum is divisible by `k`, is producing an incorrect result. The expected output for the second part is `23`, but the found output is `959`.

The issue lies in the `countSequences` function. The logic for calculating the number of subsequences with sum divisible by `k` needs to be revised. The current implementation uses a rolling dynamic programming (DP) approach, which is not properly accounting for the non-overlapping nature of subsequences - it's considering segments that overlap in terms of their ending points in S.

A corrected approach is to use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of subsequences ending at position `i` with a sum modulo `k` equal to `j`. Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 20011;

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int minSubsequences(const std::vector<int>& s) {
    std::vector<int> lis; // Longest Increasing Subsequence helper
    for (int i : s) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), i);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(i);
        } else {
            *it = i;
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int countSequences(const std::vector<int>& s, int k) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(s.size() + 1, std::vector<int>(k, 0));
    dp[0][0] = 1; // Base case: one empty sequence
    int total = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= s.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]; // Sequences not including s[i-1]
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
            int new_j = (j + s[i - 1]) % k;
            dp[i][new_j] = (dp[i][new_j] + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= s.size(); ++i) {
        total = (total + dp[i][0]) % MOD; // Only count sequences with sum % k == 0
    }

    return (total - 1 + MOD) % MOD; // Subtract the empty sequence
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int& value : s) {
        fin >> value;
    }
    fin.close();

    fout << minSubsequences(s) << '\n';
    fout << countSequences(s, k) << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This version of the `countSequences` function uses a 2D DP array to ensure that we correctly count all subsequences, including the non-overlapping ones. It then sums up the counts of all subsequences that end at each position in the array and have a sum modulo `k` of `0`.

Please note that this approach is more memory-intensive than the previous one, and depending on the problem constraints (like large `n`), it might require further optimization or a different algorithm. However, for the given constraints, this solution should work within the limits.

It seems that while the first part of the solution is correct and identifies the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences as `4`, the second part of the solution is still not producing the expected output. The expected number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k` is `23`, but the found output is `624`.

The bug is likely in the implementation of the `countSequences` function. Since the provided solution is not working as intended, let's correct the approach for counting the number of contiguous subsequences whose sum is divisible by `k`.

To count the number of such contiguous subsequences, we can use a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of the current sum modulo `k` at each step and the count of all previous sums. The count of sequences with a sum divisible by `k` can then be incremented by the count of previous sums that are congruent to the current sum modulo `k`.

Let's rewrite the `countSequences` function with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 20011;

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int minSubsequences(const std::vector<int>& s) {
    std::vector<int> lis; // Longest Increasing Subsequence helper
    for (int i : s) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), i);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(i);
        } else {
            *it = i;
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int countSequences(const std::vector<int>& s, int k) {
    std::vector<int> count(k, 0); // Count of sums modulo k
    count[0] = 1; // Empty subsequence, base case
    int sum = 0;
    int sequenceCount = 0;

    for (int num : s) {
        sum = (sum + num) % k;
        sequenceCount = (sequenceCount + count[sum]) % MOD;
        count[sum] = (count[sum] + 1) % MOD;
    }

    return (sequenceCount - 1 + MOD) % MOD; // Exclude the empty subsequence
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int& value : s) {
        fin >> value;
    }
    fin.close();

    fout << minSubsequences(s) << '\n';
    fout << countSequences(s, k) << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a single 1-dimensional array `count` to keep track of the number of previous sums that have the same sum modulo `k`. For each new element in the sequence `s`, it updates the sum modulo `k` and increments the total count of sequences by the count of the current sum modulo `k`. Finally, it adjusts the count to exclude the empty subsequence and ensures the result is in the correct modulo space by adding `MOD` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.

The corrected solution should provide the correct output for both parts of the challenge.

The expected output is `23`, but the code is outputting `22`. This discrepancy suggests that the issue lies in the counting logic. Since we are dealing with contiguous subsequences (or sequences), the approach that uses prefix sums seems correct. However, there appears to be a subtle off-by-one error or an issue in the initialization of the counts.

Upon reviewing the code closely, I can see that the subtraction of the empty subsequence is the step that is likely causing the problem. When we initialize the `count` array, we set `count[0]` to `1` to account for the empty subsequence. However, later in the loop, we are also updating `count[sum]` for each element, which means that the empty subsequence is being accounted for at the start of the array, and we shouldn't subtract it at the end.

To fix this, we need to return `sequenceCount` without subtracting `1`:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 20011;

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int minSubsequences(const std::vector<int>& s) {
    std::vector<int> lis;
    for (int i : s) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), i);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(i);
        } else {
            *it = i;
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int countSequences(const std::vector<int>& s, int k) {
    std::vector<int> count(k, 0);
    count[0] = 1;
    int sum = 0;
    int sequenceCount = 0;

    for (int num : s) {
        sum = (sum + num) % k;
        sequenceCount = (sequenceCount + count[sum]) % MOD;
        count[sum] = (count[sum] + 1) % MOD;
    }

    return sequenceCount; // No need to subtract 1 since the empty subsequence is not counted twice
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;
    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int& value : s) {
        fin >> value;
    }
    fin.close();

    fout << minSubsequences(s) << '\n';
    fout << countSequences(s, k) << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

With this correction, the code should now correctly count the number of contiguous subsequences whose sum is divisible by `k`, including the case when the subsequence consists of the entire sequence `S` itself.
