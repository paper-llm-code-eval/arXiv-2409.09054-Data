Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAXN = 100000;
const int MAXK = 50000;
const int MOD = 20011;

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");

    }
    return tail.size();
}

int sequencesDivisibleByK() {
    freq[0] = 1; // There's always one way to have sum 0 (taking no elements)
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = (sum + v[i]) % k;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
            dp[j] += freq[j];
            dp[j] %= MOD;
        }
        freq[sum]++;
        freq[sum] %= MOD;
    }

    return dp[0];
}

int main() {
    fin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) fin >> v[i];

    // Question a)
    int min_subsequences = minSubsequences();
    fout << min_subsequences << "\n";

    // Question b)
    int sequences_divisible_by_k = sequencesDivisibleByK();
    fout << sequences_divisible_by_k << "\n";
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution will calculate the answer to question (a) by finding the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. For question (b), it uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of sequences with sum divisible by `k`. The `freq` array keeps track of the frequency of each possible sum modulo `k`, and `dp` helps accumulate the count of sequences ending at each position that have a sum divisible by `k`. The code avoids using slow I/O operations and should be efficient in terms of algorithmic complexity.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it's clear that the function for question (b) is not computing the correct number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k`. The current implementation uses a single pass through the array with a dynamic programming approach to count sequences with a cumulative sum divisible by `k`. However, this approach seems to have an error in accumulating the counts. 

To fix this, we need to update the way we manage the `freq` and `dp` arrays. Each time we compute the new sum, we should only update the `dp` array for the current sum and not for all possible sums. Additionally, we should increment `dp[sum]` by `freq[sum]` before updating `freq[sum]` to include the current element.

Here's the fixed code for question (b), along with the rest of the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAXN = 100000;
const int MAXK = 50000;
const int MOD = 20011;

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int n, k, v[MAXN];
int freq[MAXK];
long long dp[MAXK];

int minSubsequences() {
    std::vector<int> tail;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto pos = std::lower_bound(tail.begin(), tail.end(), v[i]);
        if (pos == tail.end())
            tail.push_back(v[i]);
        else
            *pos = v[i];
    }
    return tail.size();
}

int sequencesDivisibleByK() {
    freq[0] = 1; // There's always one way to have sum 0 (taking no elements)
    int sum = 0;
    int prevSum;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prevSum = sum;
        sum = (sum + v[i]) % k;
        dp[sum] = (dp[sum] + freq[prevSum]) % MOD;  // Update only the dp entry for the current sum
        freq[sum] = (freq[sum] + 1) % MOD;          // Increment the frequency of the current sum
    }

    return (dp[0] + MOD - 1) % MOD;  // Subtract the initial empty sequence added at the start
}

int main() {
    fin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) fin >> v[i];

    // Question a)
    int min_subsequences = minSubsequences();
    fout << min_subsequences << '\n';

    // Question b)
    int sequences_divisible_by_k = sequencesDivisibleByK();
    fout << sequences_divisible_by_k << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code should now provide the right output for both questions (a) and (b). The key change is in the `sequencesDivisibleByK` function, where we ensure that each sequence sum is only influenced by sequence sums that could have been formed before it, thereby preventing overcounting. The increment `dp[0]` subtracts the initial empty sequence that was counted at the start, as we only want to count non-empty sequences.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's re-evaluate and correct the approach for question (b). It seems that the previous solution does not correctly calculate the number of consecutive sequences whose sum is divisible by `k`. The correct approach to solve this part of the problem involves using a prefix sum array and a frequency array to count how many times each remainder appears. 

Here is the revised solution addressing both parts of the problem:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MAXN = 100000;
const int MOD = 20011;

int n, k;
int v[MAXN];
int freq[MAXN];

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int minSubsequences() {
    std::vector<int> lis;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), v[i]);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(v[i]);
        } else {
            *it = v[i];
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int sequencesDivisibleByK() {
    long long count = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    memset(freq, 0, sizeof(freq));
    freq[0] = 1;  // Empty subsequence

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = (sum + v[i]) % k;
        count = (count + freq[sum]) % MOD;
        freq[sum]++;
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    fin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> v[i];
    }

    int min_subseq = minSubsequences();
    fout << min_subseq << "\n";

    int seq_div_k = sequencesDivisibleByK();
    fout << seq_div_k << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, the `minSubsequences` function calculates the minimum number of increasing subsequences using the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) technique. The `sequencesDivisibleByK` function uses a frequency array where `freq[i]` stores the number of prefixes with a sum that leaves a remainder of `i` when divided by `k`. As we iterate over the array, we incrementally build the sum and update the frequency of the current remainder. The total number of valid sequences (with sum % k == 0) is accumulated in the `count` variable.

This corrected code should provide the correct output for the input given, as well as for other test cases within the problem constraints.

I apologize for the oversight. However, based on the output you provided, it appears that the program result now matches the expected result for the given input:

```
Found output:
4
23
```

This is exactly the same as the expected output:

```
Expected output:
4 
23
```

Therefore, it seems that the revised solution has successfully solved the problem correctly, and no further changes are necessary.

To summarize, the `minSubsequences` function computes the answer to the first question by finding the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence, which corresponds to the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the original sequence. For the second question, `sequencesDivisibleByK` computes the number of contiguous subarrays with a sum divisible by `k` using a prefix sum and frequency count technique.

As both outputs match, the solution appears to be fixed and functioning correctly. No changes are required at this stage. If there is still an issue, please provide further details, and I'd be glad to assist you further.

Apologies for any confusion; it appears there was a misunderstanding. The error message you are seeing indicates that the compiler is interpreting text that is not part of the C++ code as code. This often happens if non-code text (such as program output comments) is included in the source file. To ensure the program compiles correctly, all non-code text should be removed or commented out, and only valid C++ syntax should be present in the source file.

Here is the entire corrected source code for the given problem:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAXN = 100000;
const int MAXK = 50000;
const int MOD = 20011;

int v[MAXN];
int freq[MAXK];

int minSubsequences(int n) {
    std::vector<int> lis;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), v[i]);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(v[i]);
        } else {
            *it = v[i];
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int sequencesDivisibleByK(int n, int k) {
    long long count = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    std::fill(freq, freq + k, 0);
    freq[0] = 1; // There's always one way to have sum 0 (taking no elements)

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = (sum + v[i]) % k;
        count = (count + freq[sum]) % MOD;
        freq[sum]++;
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
    std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> v[i];
    }

    fout << minSubsequences(n) << '\n';
    fout << sequencesDivisibleByK(n, k) << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads from the input file `calcule.in` and writes to the output file `calcule.out`. It should compile and run correctly, provided that the input file is formatted as specified in the original problem statement.

The results are equivalent, and there is no difference between the two. The program provided in the previous response appears to be correct and does not require any fixes. It correctly answers both parts of the challenge as per the requirements.
