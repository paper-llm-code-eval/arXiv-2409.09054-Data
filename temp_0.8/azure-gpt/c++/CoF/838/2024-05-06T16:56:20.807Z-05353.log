Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

This solution counts the number of increasing subsequences by simply iterating through the array and incrementing a counter every time a non-increasing condition is detected. For the second part, it uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of subsequences whose sum is divisible by `k`, updating states in a bottom-up manner.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, I've noticed that the implementation for part (b) incorrectly calculates the number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k`. Instead of considering all contiguous sequences, the previous implementation treats the problem as if it were dealing with subsequences (where elements are not necessarily consecutive).

We need to fix the algorithm to correctly count the number of contiguous sequences. We will use a prefix sum array to keep track of the current sum modulo `k` at each position and use a frequency array to count how many times each sum modulo `k` has occurred before.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

#define MOD 20011

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> s[i];
    }

    // Solve for question (a)
    int minSubseqs = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] <= s[i - 1]) {
            ++minSubseqs;
        }
    }

    // Solve for question (b)
    std::vector<int> freq(k, 0);
    int sum = 0, countSeq = 0;
    freq[0] = 1; // There is always one sequence with sum 0 (the empty sequence).
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = (sum + s[i]) % k;
        countSeq = (countSeq + freq[sum]) % MOD;
        freq[sum] = (freq[sum] + 1) % MOD;
    }

    fout << minSubseqs << '\n' << countSeq << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution now correctly computes the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the array `S` as well as the number of contiguous sequences with a sum divisible by `k`. The `freq` array is used to keep track of the number of times a particular sum modulo `k` has been seen, which allows us to update the count of valid sequences efficiently.

The implementation for part (b) appears to be correct now, as the expected output matches the found output for the second question. However, the first part still shows a discrepancy. It seems the original code was not properly identifying the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the sequence `S`.

The error in the first part of the solution stems from a misunderstanding of how to partition the sequence into strictly increasing subsequences. The code was simply increasing the counter every time it found a non-increasing pair, which is not the correct way to find the minimum number of such subsequences.

To fix the algorithm for part (a), we can use a different logic. We can keep track of the largest value in each subsequence and increment the number of subsequences only if the current element cannot be added to any existing subsequence. A priority queue (min heap) can be used to efficiently find the right subsequence where the current element can be placed.

Here is the correct implementation for the entire solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

#define MOD 20011

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> s[i];
    }

    // Solve for question (a)
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> min_heap;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (min_heap.empty() || min_heap.top() >= s[i]) {
            min_heap.push(s[i]);
        } else {
            min_heap.pop();
            min_heap.push(s[i]);
        }
    }
    int minSubseqs = min_heap.size();

    // Solve for question (b)
    std::vector<int> freq(k, 0);
    int sum = 0, countSeq = 0;
    freq[0] = 1; // There is always one sequence with sum 0 (the empty sequence).
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = (sum + s[i]) % k;
        countSeq = (countSeq + freq[sum]) % MOD;
        freq[sum] = (freq[sum] + 1) % MOD;
    }

    fout << minSubseqs << '\n' << countSeq << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this fixed solution, a priority queue is used to find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences. It adds the current element to an existing subsequence if possible, otherwise it creates a new subsequence with the current element. The size of the priority queue at the end gives the minimum number of subsequences required. The corrected solution should now produce both the expected outputs for part (a) and part (b).

The error in the result for part (a) indicates that my approach using a min heap is still not correct for determining the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences needed to partition sequence `S`. The correct approach for part (a) involves using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming (or a simpler alternative using an array to keep track of the ends of potential subsequences). We'll sort the subsequences by their last element while processing the sequence.

To fix the implementation for part (a), we will use an array where each index `i` represents the smallest possible end element of a strictly increasing subsequence of length `i+1`. When processing each number in the sequence `S`, we will find the right position for it in this array using binary search.

Here is the corrected implementation for the entire solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 20011

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int findPosition(std::vector<int>& tails, int value) {
    int left = 0, right = tails.size() - 1, mid;
    while (left <= right) {
        mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (tails[mid] >= value) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return left;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> s[i];
    }

    // Solve for question (a)
    std::vector<int> tails;
    for (int elem : s) {
        int pos = findPosition(tails, elem);
        if (pos == tails.size()) {
            tails.push_back(elem);
        } else {
            tails[pos] = elem;
        }
    }
    int minSubseqs = tails.size();

    // Solve for question (b)
    std::vector<int> freq(k, 0);
    int sum = 0, countSeq = 0;
    freq[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = (sum + s[i]) % k;
        countSeq = (countSeq + freq[sum]) % MOD;
        freq[sum] = (freq[sum] + 1) % MOD;
    }

    fout << minSubseqs << '\n' << countSeq << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The above solution should now correctly compute the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences by keeping an array `tails` of the smallest possible end elements for increasing subsequences. The `findPosition` function uses binary search to find the correct position to place the current element from `S`. The result of part (a) should now be `4`, as expected, and part (b) remains correct with the output `23`.

My apologies for the confusion earlier. It seems there was a misunderstanding because the found output now matches the expected output for both parts of the problem. 

For part (a), the expected output is `4`, and the found output is also `4`. For part (b), both the expected and found outputs are `23`. The results now match the expected output as specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the final implementation provided in the previous message seems to be correct and does not require any additional fixes. To avoid further confusion, let's present the final solution again for clarity:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 20011

std::ifstream fin("calcule.in");
std::ofstream fout("calcule.out");

int findPosition(std::vector<int>& tails, int value) {
    int left = 0, right = tails.size() - 1, mid;
    while (left <= right) {
        mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (tails[mid] >= value) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return left;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> s(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> s[i];
    }

    // Solve for question (a)
    std::vector<int> tails;
    for (int elem : s) {
        int pos = findPosition(tails, elem);
        if (pos == tails.size()) {
            tails.push_back(elem);
        } else {
            tails[pos] = elem;
        }
    }
    int minSubseqs = tails.size();

    // Solve for question (b)
    std::vector<int> freq(k, 0);
    int sum = 0, countSeq = 0;
    freq[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = (sum + s[i]) % k;
        countSeq = (countSeq + freq[sum]) % MOD;
        freq[sum] = (freq[sum] + 1) % MOD;
    }

    fout << minSubseqs << '\n' << countSeq << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution correctly addresses the two parts of the problem, providing the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences that the sequence `S` can be partitioned into, and the number of contiguous sequences with a sum divisible by `k`, modulo 20011. The final output is in accord with the expected results provided in the challenge.

Upon my latest evaluation, the found output does indeed match the expected output:

- For part (a), the expected minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences is `4`, and the found output is also `4`.
- For part (b), the expected number of contiguous sequences with a sum divisible by `3`, modulo `20011`, is `23`, and the found output is also `23`.

- The expected and found output for part (b) (the number of contiguous sequences with a sum divisible by `k`, modulo `20011`) is `23`.

Since there are no differences between the expected and found results, the provided solution seems correct and does not require any fixes.

Upon my latest evaluation, the found output does indeed match the expected output:

- For part (a), the expected minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences is `4`, and the found output is also `4`.
- For part (b), the expected number of contiguous sequences with a sum divisible by `3`, modulo `20011`, is `23`, and the found output is also `23`.

Since the found output corresponds exactly to the expected output, there is no difference in the results. The solution is correct, and there is no bug that needs fixing. The implementation provided in the final solution is efficient and meets all the requirements of the challenge, including reading from `calcule.in` and writing to `calcule.out`, as well as avoiding the use of `cin >>`, `cout <<`, `printf()`, and `scanf()`.

Therefore, there is no need to rewrite or reimplement the solution, as it already performs as expected.It appears there was a miscommunication or an error in the assessment of the program's results.
