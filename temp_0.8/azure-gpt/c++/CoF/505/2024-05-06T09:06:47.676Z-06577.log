Cei $N$ copii de la școala generală vor să formeze o echipă de fotbal compusă din $K$ elevi, dintre care cel puțin unul stângaci și cel puțin unul dreptaci. Pentru fiecare copil $i$ (de la $0$ la $N-1$) se cunoaște intervalul de timp în care acesta este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, sub forma unei perechi, $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$, cât și dacă este stângaci sau dreptaci. $K$ copii pot juca în aceeași echipa dacă intervalele de timp în care aceștia sunt disponibili se suprapun în cel puțin un punct (moment de timp).

# Cerință

Se cere numărul de moduri în care se poate alcătui o echipă cu $K$ dintre cei $N$ elevi; deoarece acest număr poate să fie foarte mare, el se va afișa modulo $10^9+9$.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `fotbal.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc câte 3 numere naturale, $start_{i}$, $end_{i}$, $f_{i}$, unde $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$ reprezintă intervalul de timp în care al $i$-lea copil este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, iar $f_{i}$ reprezintă piciorul cu care joacă al $i$-lea copil, $f_{i}=1$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este dreptaci și $f_{i}=0$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este stângaci.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `fotbal.out` va conține doar numărul de moduri cerut, în forma precizată în cerință. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq start_{i} \leq end_{i} \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* $f_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $K = 2$ și $2 \le N \le 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $K = 2$ și există cel mult $5$ copii care sunt stângaci;
* Pentru $33$ de puncte, $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping time intervals, which is a key part of the problem. The correct approach involves checking all possible combinations of players to see if there is at least one left-handed and one right-handed player whose availability overlaps.

We need to implement an algorithm that will:
1. Read the input data and store the players' availability and footedness.
2. Sort the players by their availability.
3. Count the number of ways to form a team with at least one left-handed and one right-handed player whose availability overlaps.

Let's reimplement the solution with these adjustments:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000000009;

struct Player {
    int start, end, foot;
};

std::vector<Player> players;
int N, K;
std::vector<std::vector<long long>> choose;

// Function to read input data
void read_input(std::ifstream &fin) {
    fin >> N >> K;
    players.resize(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> players[i].start >> players[i].end >> players[i].foot;
    }
}

// Function to precompute binomial coefficients
void precompute_choose(int n) {
    choose.assign(n + 1, std::vector<long long>(n + 1));
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        choose[i][0] = choose[i][i] = 1;
        for (int j = 1; j < i; j++)
            choose[i][j] = (choose[i - 1][j - 1] + choose[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
    }
}

// Check if two intervals overlap
bool overlap(Player &a, Player &b) {
    return std::max(a.start, b.start) <= std::min(a.end, b.end);
}

// Function to count the number of valid teams
long long count_teams() {
    long long total_teams = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int left_count = 0, right_count = 0;
        // Count how many left and right footed players overlap with the i-th player
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            if (i != j && overlap(players[i], players[j])) {
                if (players[j].foot == 0) left_count++;
                else right_count++;
            }
        }
        // Add the number of possible teams that include the i-th player
        for (int l = 1; l < K; l++) {
            int r = K - l - 1; // Number of right-footed players
            if (l <= left_count && r <= right_count) {
                total_teams = (total_teams + choose[left_count][l] * choose[right_count][r]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    return total_teams;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("fotbal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("fotbal.out");

    read_input(fin);
    precompute_choose(N);
    long long result = count_teams();
    fout << result << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads the input, precomputes the binomial coefficients, and then iterates through each player, counting how many left-footed and right-footed players overlap with that player's availability. Then, it calculates the number of ways to form a team with at least one left-footed and one right-footed player. The output is the total number of valid teams, modulo $10^9+9$.

The previous solution incorrectly calculates the total number of valid teams by not handling the overlap between players correctly. It also doesn't account for the constraint that we are only looking for combinations of `K` players that all have overlapping time intervals. The calculation of combinations is not being done within the context of overlapping intervals, which is what leads to the incorrect output.

We can fix this by using a different approach. We can first sort the players by their end time, and for each player, we can use binary search to find the range of players that overlap with this player. Then, we can calculate the number of valid teams that can be formed from this range, ensuring that we include at least one left-footed and one right-footed player.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000000009;

struct Player {
    int start, end, foot;
};

std::vector<Player> players;
int N, K;

// Function to read input data
void read_input(std::ifstream &fin) {
    fin >> N >> K;
    players.resize(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> players[i].start >> players[i].end >> players[i].foot;
    }
}

// Function to write output data
void write_output(std::ofstream &fout, long long result) {
    fout << result << '\n';
}

// Check if two players are available at the same time
bool is_overlap(const Player &a, const Player &b) {
    return !(a.end < b.start || b.end < a.start);
}

// Custom comparator to sort players by their end time
bool end_time_comparator(const Player &a, const Player &b) {
    return a.end < b.end;
}

// Count the number of ways to form a team
long long count_teams() {
    // Sort players by their end time
    std::sort(players.begin(), players.end(), end_time_comparator);

    long long result = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::vector<int> dp(K + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;  // Base case: one way to choose a team of 0 players

        // Count available left-footed and right-footed players that overlap with player i
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N && is_overlap(players[i], players[j]); ++j) {
            for (int k = K - 1; k >= 0; --k) {
                if (dp[k] > 0) {
                    dp[k + 1] = (dp[k + 1] + dp[k]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Add to the result only if player i is left-footed and there are K-1 other players
        // or if player i is right-footed and there are K-1 other players including at least one left-footed
        if (players[i].foot == 0) {
            result = (result + dp[K - 1]) % MOD;
        } else {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < N && is_overlap(players[i], players[j]); ++j) {
                if (players[j].foot == 0) {
                    result = (result + dp[K - 1]) % MOD;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {

    long long result = count_teams();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates through each player to calculate the number of valid teams that can be formed with other players whose time intervals overlap with the current player. It ensures that each team includes at least one left-footed and one right-footed player by using dynamic programming to keep track of valid team compositions and only adds to the result if the necessary conditions are met.

The error in the previous solution is that it does not correctly account for the overlap of time intervals for the players when forming a team. Moreover, it doesn't ensure that there's at least one left-handed and one right-handed player in each team. 

To fix the solution, we need to:

1. Sort the players by their starting time.
2. For each player, we can use binary search to find the range of players that can form a team with this player (overlap in time intervals).
3. Within this range, we need to count teams that include at least one left-handed and one right-handed player.

Let's try a new solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000000009;

    // Pre-calculate number of left and right footed players at each index
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        left[i] = players[i].foot == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        right[i] = players[i].foot == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        if (i > 0) {

            right[i] += right[i - 1];
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int left_foot = players[i].foot == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        int right_foot = players[i].foot == 1 ? 1 : 0;

        // Binary search to find the upper bound of the range
        int low = i + 1, high = N - 1, mid;
        while (low <= high) {
            mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (players[mid].start <= players[i].end) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        int total_left = left[high] - left[i];
        int total_right = right[high] - right[i];

        // If we have the required number of players to form a team with at least one of each foot
        if (left_foot + total_left > 0 && right_foot + total_right > 0) {
            // Calculate the total number of ways to pick K-1 more players from the range [i+1, high]
            int range_size = high - i;
            if (range_size >= K - 1) {
                result = (result + combination(range_size, K - 1)) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

long long combination(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n) return 0;
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {

This solution now correctly finds the range of players that can form a team with the current player, ensuring overlap in time intervals. Then, it calculates the total number of ways to pick the rest of the team from this range, making sure that we have at least one player of each foot. The result is the total number of valid teams, taking care not to double-count, and taking care of the modular arithmetic.

The error messages indicate that the `combination` and `modInverse` functions were not declared before they were used. This can happen if the function definitions are placed after the function calls without prior declarations, or if the function names are misspelled. To fix this, we need to either move the function definitions above the first call or provide forward declarations before they are used.

Let's correct the program by providing forward declarations for `combination` and `modInverse`:

```cpp

By providing the forward declarations, the compiler knows about the existence of `combination` and `modInverse` before their usage in `count_teams`. Now the program should compile and execute successfully.

The program still doesn't correctly handle the requirement that all K players on a team must have overlapping intervals. The current binary search approach attempts to find a range of players who overlap with a given player, but it doesn't ensure that all players within the chosen team overlap with each other. Additionally, the combination calculation doesn't account for the need for at least one left-footed and one right-footed player on the team.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct approach:

1. Preprocess the players into two separate lists based on footedness and then sort these lists based on their availability intervals.
2. Iterate through each player and use two pointers to maintain a window of players whose intervals overlap with the current player.
3. Within this window, count the number of left-footed and right-footed players.
4. If there are enough players to form a team and the minimum footedness requirement is met, calculate the number of valid combinations and add them to the result.

Here is the updated solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000000009;

struct Player {
    int start, end, foot;
};

std::vector<Player> lefties, righties;
int N, K;

// Function to read input data
void read_input(std::ifstream &fin) {
    fin >> N >> K;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        Player p;
        fin >> p.start >> p.end >> p.foot;
        if (p.foot == 0) lefties.push_back(p);
        else righties.push_back(p);
    }
}

bool comparePlayers(const Player &a, const Player &b) {
    return a.end < b.end;
}

// Function to find the number of teams
long long find_teams() {
    // Sort both lefties and righties based on end time
    std::sort(lefties.begin(), lefties.end(), comparePlayers);
    std::sort(righties.begin(), righties.end(), comparePlayers);

    long long total_ways = 0;

    // Helper lambda to calculate combinations
    auto combinations = [](int n, int k) -> long long {
        if (k > n) return 0;
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            result = (result * (n - i)) % MOD;
            for (int j = 1; j <= i + 1; ++j) {
                // Modular multiplicative inverse
                long long inverse = 1, base = j, exponent = MOD - 2;
                while (exponent > 0) {
                    if (exponent % 2 == 1) {
                        inverse = (inverse * base) % MOD;
                    }
                    base = (base * base) % MOD;
                    exponent /= 2;
                }
                result = (result * inverse) % MOD;
            }
        }
        return result;
    };

    // Iterate over all players
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int start_time = (i < lefties.size()) ? lefties[i].start : righties[i - lefties.size()].start;
        int end_time = (i < lefties.size()) ? lefties[i].end : righties[i - lefties.size()].end;
        int count_left = 0, count_right = 0;

        // Count overlapping lefties
        for (const auto &lefty : lefties) {
            if (lefty.start <= end_time) count_left++;
            else break;
        }

        // Count overlapping righties
        for (const auto &righty : righties) {
            if (righty.start <= end_time) count_right++;
            else break;
        }

        // If we have enough players to form a team
        if (count_left + count_right >= K) {
            // If this player is left-footed, exclude one left-footed player from the team
            if (i < lefties.size()) count_left--;
            // Otherwise, exclude one right-footed player
            else count_right--;
            
            // Calculate the number of valid combinations
            for (int left_players = 1; left_players < K; ++left_players) {
                int right_players = K - left_players - 1;
                if (left_players <= count_left && right_players <= count_right) {
                    long long ways = combinations(count_left, left_players);
                    ways = (ways * combinations(count_right, right_players)) % MOD;
                    total_ways = (total_ways + ways) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return total_ways;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("fotbal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("fotbal.out");

    read_input(fin);
    long long result = find_teams();
    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the solution correctly accounts for the overlap of time intervals by maintaining a window of overlapping players and calculates the number of valid teams by considering the required footedness. It should now calculate the correct number of team formations and thus produce the expected output.

The solution provided above still does not properly handle the overlap constraints for the intervals and the requirement that a team must include at least one left-footed and one right-footed player.

The correct algorithm should be as follows:

1. Sort the players based on their availability intervals.
2. Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window of players whose intervals overlap.
3. Count the number of left-footed and right-footed players within the sliding window.
4. If there are enough players to form a team and both footedness types are present, calculate the number of valid combinations.
5. Slide the window to consider the next set of overlapping intervals and repeat the process.

Here's the corrected and efficient solution that properly handles the overlapping intervals and footedness:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000000009;

struct Player {
    int start, end, foot;
};

std::vector<Player> players;
int N, K;

// Function to read input data
void read_input(std::ifstream &fin) {
    fin >> N >> K;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        Player p;
        fin >> p.start >> p.end >> p.foot;
        players.push_back(p);
    }
}

bool comparePlayers(const Player &a, const Player &b) {
    return a.end < b.end;
}

// Function to calculate the factorial modulo MOD
std::vector<long long> factorial(int n) {
    std::vector<long long> fact(n + 1);
    fact[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % MOD;
    }
    return fact;
}

// Function to calculate the modular inverse
long long modInverse(long long a, long long m = MOD) {
    long long m0 = m, t, q;
    long long x0 = 0, x1 = 1;

    if (m == 1)
        return 0;

    while (a > 1) {
        q = a / m;
        t = m;
        m = a % m, a = t;
        t = x0;
        x0 = x1 - q * x0;
        x1 = t;
    }

    if (x1 < 0) 
        x1 += m0;

    return x1;
}

// Function to calculate nCr modulo MOD
long long nCr(long long n, long long r, const std::vector<long long> &fact) {
    if (r > n) return 0;
    return fact[n] * modInverse(fact[r]) % MOD * modInverse(fact[n - r]) % MOD;
}

// Function to count the number of valid teams
long long count_teams(const std::vector<long long> &fact) {
    // Sort players by their end time
    std::sort(players.begin(), players.end(), comparePlayers);

    long long total_ways = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (K == 2) {
            // Special case for K = 2
            for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
                if (players[i].start <= players[j].end &&
                    players[j].start <= players[i].end &&
                    players[i].foot != players[j].foot) {
                    ++total_ways;
                }
            }
        } else {
            int left = 0, right = 0;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < N && players[j].start <= players[i].end; ++j) {
                (players[j].foot == 0) ? ++left : ++right;
            }
            if (players[i].foot == 0) --left; else --right;
            for (int l = 1; l < K && l <= left + 1; ++l) {
                int r = K - l - 1;
                if (r <= right) {
                    total_ways = (total_ways + nCr(left, l - 1, fact) * nCr(right, r, fact)) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return total_ways;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("fotbal.in");
    std::ofstream fout("fotbal.out");

    read_input(fin);
    auto fact = factorial(N);
    long long result = count_teams(fact);
    
    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a precomputed factorial array for efficient calculation of nCr modulo MOD. It accounts for the special case when K is 2 since we don't need to calculate combinations for that case, just count the pairs directly. For other values of K, it uses a sliding window algorithm to count the number of left-footed (`left`) and right-footed (`right`) players that overlap with the current player's interval, and then calculates the number of valid combinations that can be formed with these players. The total number of ways is calculated modulo MOD.
