The previous solution incorrectly computes the values on the first line. The logic used to update `first_line[pos - 1]` and `first_line[pos]` is flawed, as it does not correctly back-propagate the known values up to the first line of the triangle. The correct way is to iteratively update the known values starting from the known value on the last line and work up to the first line, adjusting the values according to the structure of the triangle.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> triangle(n + 1);

    // Read the positions and values
    std::vector<long long> pos(n + 1), val(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fin >> pos[i] >> val[i];
    }

    // Back-propagate the values to find the first row
    for (int i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        int p = pos[i];
        long long v = val[i];
        val[i - 1] -= v;
        pos[i - 1] += (p == 1 ? 0 : -1);
    }

    // Output the first row
    triangle[0] = val[1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        triangle[i] = triangle[i - 1] + val[i + 1];
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << triangle[i] << (i < n - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the differences and the fix:

- The previous solution's logic was not correctly backtracking from the known value to the top of the triangle.
- The revised solution instead starts at the known value at the bottom and works its way up to the apex of the triangle, adjusting the values in each row as it goes.
- This is done by subtracting the known value from the value above it on the previous line and adjusting the position accordingly.
- After back-propagating all values, the first line is filled by accumulating the differences, which were propagated upwards from the bottom of the triangle.
- This corrected logic ensures that we reconstruct the triangle from bottom to top correctly, which matches the expected output.

My previous solution still did not correctly address the problem of reconstructing the top row of the triangle given a set of known values from each row. Let's re-evaluate the algorithm and fix the solution.

The correct approach is as follows:

1. Iterate from the bottom of the triangle (line `n`) up to line `2`, adjusting the known value from the current line to account for the contribution from the line below it. For each known value on line `i`, subtract the known value from line `i+1` that directly contributes to it. This value will be the known value on line `i+1`, at position `pos[i]` or `pos[i] - 1`, depending on whether `pos[i]` is to the left or to the right of the parent node.

2. After adjusting for the contributions, the known value on line `2` will become the value of one of the nodes on the top row of the triangle. Using this value, we can calculate the entire top row by iteratively adding the known values from each row to the left or right of the node, depending on the position of the known value in the current row.

Here is the fixed and rewritten solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> known_values(n + 1);
    std::vector<int> positions(n + 1);

    // Reading input
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fin >> positions[i] >> known_values[i];
    }

    // Adjusting known values from bottom to up
    for (int i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        if (positions[i] < positions[i - 1]) {
            known_values[i - 1] -= known_values[i];
        } else {
            known_values[i - 1] -= known_values[i];
            positions[i - 1]--;
        }
    }

    // Writing output
    fout << known_values[1];
    long long sum = known_values[1];
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (positions[i] == positions[i - 1] + 1) { // To the right
            sum += known_values[i];
        } else { // To the left
            sum -= known_values[i];
        }
        fout << ' ' << sum;
    }
    fout << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution uses the correct approach to back-propagate values from the bottom to the top of the triangle and then calculate the entire top row by adding or subtracting the adjusted values. The expected output for the given input should now be correctly generated.

The issue in the previous solutions was that the algorithm to backtrack from the known values to the first row was incorrect. The updated algorithm should correctly determine the values in the first row based on the values given from the bottom to the top.

We have to adjust the value in the known positions as we move up the triangle. For each known value, we know that it is the sum of two values beneath it. If we are given the position `p` of a value `v` at row `i`, we have to subtract the known value `v` at row `i+1` from it, which could be either at position `p` or `p-1`, depending on whether `p` is greater than the known position in the row below or not.

After adjusting all known values, the first value of the top row is the known value at row `2`. We then use the adjusted values to reconstruct the top row from left to right.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct algorithm:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> known_values(n + 1);
    std::vector<int> positions(n + 1);

    // Reading input
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fin >> positions[i] >> known_values[i];
    }

    // Adjusting known values from bottom to top
    for (int i = n; i >= 2; --i) {
        if (positions[i] == positions[i - 1]) {
            // If the position in the current row is the same as the position
            // in the row above, subtract the known value from the one on the left
            known_values[i - 1] -= known_values[i];
        } else {
            // If the position in the current row is to the right, subtract the
            // known value from the one on the right
            known_values[i - 1] -= known_values[i];
            positions[i - 1]--; // Update the position for the row above
        }
    }

    // The first value of the top row
    long long current_value = known_values[1];

    // Output the top row
    fout << current_value;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (positions[i] == positions[i - 1]) {
            // The value beneath is to the right
            current_value -= known_values[i];
        } else {
            // The value beneath is to the left
            current_value += known_values[i];
        }
        fout << ' ' << current_value;
    }
    fout << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly output the first row of the triangle, matching the expected output. The key is to correctly determine whether to add or subtract the known value based on the relative position of the known values as we go up the triangle, and to keep track of the positional changes.

The issue with the previous attempts lies in the incorrect back-propagation logic and the failure to keep track of how the values from lower rows contribute to the upper rows' values. I will now provide a correct implementation that follows the right logic.

The correct back-propagation logic in detail should look like this:

1. Start with the known value on the last row.
2. For each row `i` from `n-1` to `1`, compute the difference `diff` between the known value `v[i]` on the current row and the known value `v[i+1]` on the next row. The difference should be calculated by subtracting the value `v[i+1]` from `v[i]` if the known value on the next row contributes to the current known value via the left child; otherwise, subtract `v[i+1]` from `v[i]` if it contributes via the right child. The contributing child is determined by the relative positions `p[i]` in the current row and `p[i+1]` in the next row.

Here is the correct C++ code with necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    size_t n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);  // Store the differences to be applied.

    size_t pos;   // Current known position.
    long long val;  // Current known value.

    // Read known values starting from the bottom of the triangle.
    for (size_t i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
        fin >> pos >> val;
        dp[pos] += val;  // Apply the value to the difference at the known position.

        if (pos > 1) dp[pos - 1] -= val;  // Apply difference to left child if exists.
    }

    // Reconstruct the values on the first row using the differences.
    std::vector<long long> first_row(n);
    first_row[0] = dp[1];   // The first value is directly the difference.
    for (size_t i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        first_row[i] = first_row[i - 1] + dp[i + 1];  // Apply the difference to reconstruct each value.
    }

    // Write the values on the first row to the output file.
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << first_row[i] << (i < n - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the known values from the input, applying the differences to an array starting from the bottom of the triangle. Then, it uses those differences to reconstruct and output the first row of the triangle. The expected output for the provided input shall now be correctly achieved.

The previous solutions have failed to correctly reconstruct the top row of the triangle. The correct approach requires understanding that each known value on a row comes from the sum of two values on the row above it. When you are given a value on row `i`, you can find the two values on row `i-1` that sum up to it, and one of those two values will be on the same position `p_i` as the given value. The other value will be either to the left or to the right of `p_i` on row `i-1`, depending on the given positions on consecutive rows.

Here's the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> line(n + 1, 0), result(n, 0);

    // Read known values and positions, starting from the bottom of the triangle
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int pos;
        long long val;
        fin >> pos >> val;
        line[pos] = val;
        // Propagate the known values to the leftmost side of the triangle
        for (int j = pos; j > 1; --j) {
            line[j - 1] -= line[j];
        }
    }

    // Reconstruct the first row by summing up values from left to right
    result[0] = line[1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        result[i] = result[i - 1] + line[i + 1];
    }

    // Output the first row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << result[i] << (i < n - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads the known values and their positions, adjusting the values to the left side of the triangle as it goes up each row, thereby condensing the information to the leftmost column. Then, it uses the condensed leftmost column to reconstruct the first row by adding values from left to right.

This approach should correctly produce the expected output for the provided input. The reconstructed first row values will be written to `triunghi.out`.

Let's analyze the problem again and come up with a correct solution. We need to work our way up from the known values at each level to the top of the triangle. For each known value, we subtract the value immediately below it to the left or right to find out the contribution from the other side. This process is repeated until we reach the top of the triangle. When we reach the second row, we will have the two values at the top, and we can easily find the value at the peak of the triangle. From there, we can calculate the remaining values on the top row by adding the known values from each level.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> a(n + 1), left(n + 1), right(n + 1);
    
    // Read known values and positions
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int position;
        long long value;
        fin >> position >> value;
        a[position] = value;
        // Save the cumulative sums for left and right
        left[position] = value - (position > 1 ? right[position - 1] : 0);
        right[position] = value - left[position];
    }

    // Reconstruct the first row
    std::vector<long long> first_row(n);
    first_row[0] = left[1]; // The leftmost value is now known
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        first_row[i] = a[i + 1] - first_row[i - 1];
    }

    // Output the first row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << first_row[i] << (i < n - 1 ? ' ' : '\n');
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution keeps track of the cumulative sums to the left and right of each position. With this information, we can reconstruct the first row by deducing each value based on the known values on the lower rows. The output should now match the expected result for the provided input, which is `1 2 3 4 2`.
