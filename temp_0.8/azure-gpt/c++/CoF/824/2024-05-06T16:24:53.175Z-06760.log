Se consideră un triunghi alcătuit din numere naturale scrise pe $n$ linii ca în figura alăturată. Liniile triunghiului sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, începând cu linia de la baza triunghiului (linia de jos), iar poziţiile pe linie sunt numerotate începând cu $1$ de la stânga la dreapta.
Fiecare număr din triunghi, exceptând pe cele de pe linia $1$, este egal cu suma numerelor aflate imediat sub el, în stânga şi respectiv în dreapta lui.

# Cerință

Cunoscând câte un număr de pe fiecare linie a triunghiului, determinaţi toate numerele de pe linia $1$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `triunghi.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii din triunghi. Pe următoarele $n$ linii sunt descrise informaţiile despre triunghi.

I can see that the problem in the previous solution was due to misunderstanding the problem statement. The given values for each line in the file `triunghi.in` represent the value of some position in the triangle, and we need to reconstruct the triangle from the top down, not just subtract adjacent values. To do this correctly, we need to track the differences up to the top row correctly.

Let's fix the approach:

1. Read the `n` lines from the input file, with the known positions and values on each line.
2. Use an array to keep track of the differences between adjacent values on the same line, working our way up to the first line.
3. For each known value from line `i`, update the differences array appropriately, ensuring we maintain the constraint that the value at position `p` on line `i` is the sum of the values at positions `p` and `p+1` on line `i-1`.
4. Once we have the differences for the first line, we compute the actual values and write them to the output file.

Here is the rewritten solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> diff(n + 1, 0); // Array to keep track of differences between adjacent numbers

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int pos, line;
        long long value;
        fin >> line >> value;
        pos = n - line; // Position in terms of the top-most line
        diff[pos] += value; // Update the difference for the current position
        if (pos > 0) {
            diff[pos - 1] -= value; // Also update the difference for the previous position
        }
    }
    fin.close();

    // Now we have our differences, compute the actual values starting from the top
    std::vector<long long> result(n);
    result[0] = diff[0]; // The first value is the same as the first difference
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        result[i] = result[i - 1] + diff[i]; // Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous value and the difference
    }

    // Write the result to the output file
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << result[i] << (i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly reconstruct the triangle according to the problem statement and produce the expected output when the given input data is processed.

The current solution is incorrect because it doesn't properly backtrack the given values to deduce the values of the first line. It attempts to accumulate differences, but this is not how the problem is structured. We need to work our way back up the triangle correctly.

Firstly, we need to store the given values in a way that allows us to backtrack from the known value to the top of the triangle, taking into account the structure of the triangle as described in the problem statement. To fix this, we can use the given `(pi, vi)` pairs to backtrack the values of the first line.

Here's the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");
    
    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> line_vals(n + 1, 0); // Store the known values for each line
    
    // Read the positions and values, and store them
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int pos;
        long long val;
        fin >> pos >> val;
        line_vals[i] = val;
    }
    fin.close();
    
    // Backtrack from the known values to deduce the values of the first line
    for (int i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        line_vals[i - 1] -= line_vals[i];
    }
    
    // Output the reconstructed values of the first line
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fout << line_vals[i] << (i == n ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now correctly reconstruct the values of the first line using the provided values. It works by subtracting the known value from the line below it, effectively "removing" the contribution of the lower line's value. This subtraction is done for each line starting from the bottom-most (nth line) given value up to the second line, in reverse order. This way, we are left with the values of the first line, which can then be outputted directly.

The previous solution is still incorrect because it does not properly backtrack the sums to the top of the triangle. The idea to subtract the known values from the line below is based on the wrong assumption. Instead, we need to work with the structure of the triangle, which has that each number is equal to the sum of the two numbers below it.

Here's how we can fix it:

1. Read the number of lines `n` and then read each known value and its position, storing them in an appropriate data structure.
2. Start from the last known value (which is the closest to the top line) and calculate the values above this known value up to the top line by removing the effect of the known values below it.
3. After reconstructing the top line, write the values to the output file.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    // Read number of lines and the positions/values from the input file
    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> values(n + 1);
    std::vector<int> positions(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fin >> positions[i] >> values[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    // Reconstruct the top row by backtracking from the known values
    for (int i = n; i > 1; i--) {
        int distance = positions[i] - positions[i - 1]; // The horizontal distance between known values
        long long above_value = values[i]; // We start from the known value and "move up" the triangle
        for (int j = 0; j < distance; j++) {
            above_value = (above_value - values[i - 1]) / 2; // Inverse operation of summing two adjacent numbers
        }
        values[i - 1] = above_value; // Set the value above the current one
    }
    
    // Output the top row values to the output file
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fout << values[i] << " ";
    }
    fout << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution now correctly backtracks from the known values on each line to reconstruct the values on the first line, writing the correct result to the output file.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's re-evaluate and correct the solution with a proper understanding of the problem.

The main mistake in previous attempts was not correctly propagating the known values up to the first line. Every number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers immediately below it (left and right). Given a number on any line, we can determine the values of the numbers above it by subtracting the known values descending from it on subsequent lines.

Here's the correct algorithm:

1. Read the input and store the known positions and their values into a vector.
2. For each line from the bottom (2nd line to nth line), calculate the value of its parent.
3. The parent value on the line above (line `i-1`) is calculated by subtracting the known value on the current line (line `i`) from the known value on the next line (line `i+1`) and then dividing by 2.
4. Store the calculated parent values in a vector representing the first line.
5. Write the values of the first line to the output file.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, long long>> known_values(n);

    // Read known values for each line
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> known_values[i].first >> known_values[i].second;
    }
    fin.close();

    std::vector<long long> first_line(n, 0);
    // Backtrack from the last known value to compute the first line values
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int position = known_values[i].first - 1;
        long long value = known_values[i].second;
        
        // Calculate the difference needed to adjust the parent's value
        long long diff = value;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            diff -= known_values[j].second;
        }

        // Adjust the parent value and update the first line
        if (position > 0) {
            first_line[position - 1] += diff / 2;
        }
        if (position < n - 1) {
            first_line[position] += (diff + 1) / 2;
        }
    }

    // Write the first line values to the output file
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << first_line[i] << (i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should now output the correct values for the `triunghi.out` based on the input data given in `triunghi.in`. It should match the expected result and produce the output:

The previous solutions have failed to correctly reconstruct the first line of the triangle. Let's carefully fix the solution by applying the correct backtracking method.

We will use the following approach:

1. Start from the known value at the lowest position (closest to the triangle's base) and backtrack to find all values above it until we reach the top. This is possible because we know the position and value for each line.
2. To backtrack, we will calculate the values to the left and right of the known value on each line until we reach the first line. We know that the value in the triangle is the sum of the two values immediately below it, so knowing one value and its sum allows us to find the other value.
3. We store the values in a vector that represents the first line, and we update it as we backtrack from the known values.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<long long> triangle(n + 1, 0); // Array to hold the first line
    std::vector<int> positions(n + 1, 0); // Array to hold the positions of known values

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int pos;
        long long value;
        fin >> pos >> value;
        positions[i] = pos;
        // Propagate the known values up to the first line
        triangle[pos] = value; // Set the known value
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 1; --j) {
            triangle[positions[j]] -= triangle[positions[j] + 1];
        }
    }
    fin.close();

    // Output the first line values to the output file
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fout << triangle[i] << " ";
    }
    fout << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We start with reading the number of lines, `n`.
- We create a vector `triangle` to hold the first line's values and a vector `positions` to hold the positions of known values.
- For each known value (`pos`, `value`), we update `triangle[pos]` with the value read from the input.
- We then propagate the effect of this value to the first line by updating `triangle[positions[j]]` for all lines `j` above the current line `i`.
- Finally, we output the values of the first line to the output file.

This code should produce the correct output for the given input data.

I apologize for the misunderstanding of the problem structure in previous solutions. To correct the approach, I will take extra care to properly reconstruct the values of the first line from the given values on subsequent lines, using the rules of the triangle.

Here is the step-by-step strategy we will use:

1. Initialize an array to represent the entire triangle, filling it with zeros.
2. Start from the bottommost known value and work our way up to the first line, calculating the required values to match the known value for each line correctly.
3. For each known value, we can determine the two values directly above it (on the previous line) by considering the difference between the known value and the sum of the values on the next line that contribute to it. This is because each number is the sum of the two numbers directly below it.
4. After finding these values for each known value given in the input, we will obtain the full first line of the triangle.
5. Write the first line values to the output file.

Here is the re-written and fixed solution using correct backtracking:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    // Read the number of lines
    int n;
    fin >> n;
    // Initialize the triangle with zeros
    std::vector<std::vector<long long>> triangle(n + 1, std::vector<long long>(n + 1, 0));

    // Input processing
    for (int line = n, offset = 0; line >= 1; --line, ++offset) {
        int pos;
        long long value;
        fin >> pos >> value;
        int index = pos + offset; // Adjust index because the input counts from the bottom up
        triangle[line][index] = value;

        // Backtrack to find the first line values
        for (int l = line + 1, idx = index; l <= n; ++l, --idx) {
            triangle[l][idx - 1] = triangle[l][idx] - triangle[l - 1][idx];
            if (idx - 2 >= 0) {
                triangle[l][idx - 2] = triangle[l - 1][idx - 1] - triangle[l][idx - 1];
            }
        }
    }
    fin.close();

    // Output the first line
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << triangle[n][i] << (i == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code should now satisfy the problem's requirements and output the expected result for the given input file `triunghi.in`.
