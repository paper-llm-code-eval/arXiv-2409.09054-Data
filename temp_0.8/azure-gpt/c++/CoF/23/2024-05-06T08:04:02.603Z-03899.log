Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.
* Pentru teste in valoare de `18` puncte datele de intrare sunt cunoscute. Mai precis:
Testul 0 : `n = 91, e = 90`
Testul 1 : `n = 30, e = 435`
Testul 2 : `n = 7, e = 16`
* Pentru alte teste in valoare de `15` puncte `n≤9`.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Certainly! Below is a C++ code block that should fulfill the specified challenge requirements:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

std::ifstream fin("galeti.in");
std::ofstream fout("galeti.out");

int main() {
    long long n, e;
    fin >> n >> e;
    std::vector<long long> buckets(n + 1, 1);

    // The strategy is to start from the last bucket and find the rightmost
    // non-empty bucket to pour into, such that the effort matches e.
    for (long long i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        for (long long j = i - 1; j > 0; --j) {
            if (buckets[j] && (e - buckets[i]) >= (j - 1)) {
                e -= buckets[i];
                fout << i << " " << j << "\n";
                buckets[j] += buckets[i];
                buckets[i] = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code opens the input file `galeti.in` to read the values of `n` and `e`, and the output file `galeti.out` to write the sequence of bucket pours. It uses a greedy strategy that starts pouring from the last bucket towards the first one and checks if the current e value minus the bucket's water volume is greater than or equal to the position of the last non-empty bucket. If that condition is met, it pours the water from the current bucket into the found bucket and updates the effort `e` accordingly. The loop continues until we process all buckets but the first one.

Please note that this is a greedy approach. The problem may have a better and more efficient solution, especially considering that the challenge emphasizes fastest code execution. This solution is provided as a general approach to the described problem.

The initial solution proposed does not provide the correct result because it lacks the correct logic to ensure that all water ends up in the first bucket with the exact effort `e`. The strategy taken does not consider all the possible ways the buckets can be emptied according to the rules, and it does not guarantee the total effort used is exactly `e`.

To ensure we meet the exact effort `e` and all water ends up in the first bucket, we need to backtrack to find the right sequence of pours. We are looking for a sequence of pours such that at each step, the effort to pour from bucket `i` to bucket `j` is possible and the remaining effort matches the water distribution.

Here's the fixed and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

std::ifstream fin("galeti.in");
std::ofstream fout("galeti.out");

void FindPourSequence(long long n, long long e, std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>>& sequence) {
    sequence.clear();
    // Start from the rightmost bucket and attempt to pour into every possible left bucket
    for (long long i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        long long pourInto = i - 1;
        while (e - (i - pourInto) >= 0 && pourInto > 0) {
            sequence.emplace_back(i, pourInto);
            e -= (i - pourInto);
            pourInto--;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, e;
    fin >> n >> e;

    std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>> sequence;
    FindPourSequence(n, e, sequence);

    // We need to check whether we have used the exact effort `e` or not
    if (!sequence.empty() && sequence.back().second == 1 && e == 0) {
        // Output the sequence in reverse, as we stored it from right to left
        for (auto it = sequence.rbegin(); it != sequence.rend(); ++it) {
            fout << it->first << " " << it->second << "\n";
        }
    } else {
        // If we couldn't find a solution, write an appropriate message
        fout << "No solution\n";
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The `FindPourSequence` function is designed to try pouring water from right to left, filling the sequence vector with pairs of buckets where water is poured from and poured into. We subtract from `e` the distance between buckets, which represents the effort made. If the resulting sequence leads to an exact effort of `e`, it means we found the correct sequence of pours.

After we finish calculating the sequence, we verify if the last pour was into the first bucket and if the remaining effort `e` is zero. If these conditions are met, we output the sequence in reverse order; otherwise, we print that no solution could be found.

Please note that this approach assumes there will only be one solution which results in exact `e` effort. If the problem requires handling multiple solutions, additional logic would be required to explore alternative pour sequences.

My previous attempt did not address the challenge correctly. Let's re-evaluate the problem with a correct approach.

The key observation is that we need to find a sequence of pours that will result in the specified effort. We have to pour the water from right to left while making sure that the exact effort `e` is used when all water ends up in the first bucket. The effort to pour from bucket `i` to bucket `j` is `i - j` times the water in bucket `i`.

To solve this, we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. We will try to pour water from each bucket to the leftmost possible bucket and check if we reach the exact effort. If not, we backtrack and try the next option.

Here's the revised solution with backtracking, which should provide the correct result for the given inputs:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

std::ifstream fin("galeti.in");
std::ofstream fout("galeti.out");

bool pour(long long n, long long e, std::vector<long long>& buckets, std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>>& result) {
    if (e == 0) {
        // Check if all water is in the first bucket
        long long water_in_first = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            water_in_first += buckets[i];
        }
        return water_in_first == n;
    }

    for (long long i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        if (buckets[i] > 0) {
            for (long long j = i - 1; j > 0; --j) {
                if (buckets[j] > 0 && (e - buckets[i]) >= 0) {
                    // Pour water from bucket i to j
                    result.emplace_back(i, j);
                    buckets[j] += buckets[i];
                    buckets[i] = 0;
                    if (pour(n, e - buckets[i], buckets, result)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    // Backtrack
                    buckets[i] = buckets[j] - buckets[i];
                    buckets[j] -= buckets[i];
                    result.pop_back();
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    long long n, e;
    fin >> n >> e;
    std::vector<long long> buckets(n + 1, 1);
    std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>> result;

    if (pour(n, e, buckets, result)) {
        for (const auto& p : result) {
            fout << p.first << " " << p.second << "\n";
        }
    } else {
        fout << "No solution\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This updated solution initializes all buckets with 1 liter of water and then attempts to find a valid sequence of pours using a recursive function `pour`. If the exact effort is achieved and all water is in the first bucket, it prints out the sequence of pours. If not, it outputs "No solution".

However, there seems to be an error in calculating the effort when backtracking. The effort should be subtracted by `(i - j) * buckets[i]` rather than just `buckets[i]`. Let's correct the code:

```cpp
bool pour(long long n, long long e, std::vector<long long>& buckets, std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>>& result) {
    if (e == 0) {
        // Check if all water is in the first bucket
        if (buckets[1] == n) {
            return true; // Correct effort and pouring sequence found
        }
        return false; // Not all water is in the first bucket
    }

    for (long long i = 2; i <= n; ++i) { // Start from the second bucket
        if (buckets[i] == 0) continue; // Skip empty buckets
        for (long long j = 1; j < i; ++j) { // Try to pour into every possible bucket to the left
            if (e - (i - j) >= 0) { // Check if we have enough effort left
                // Pour from bucket i to bucket j
                buckets[j] += buckets[i];
                e -= (i - j);
                result.push_back({i, j});

                if (pour(n, e, buckets, result)) {
                    return true;
                }

                // Backtrack
                e += (i - j);
                buckets[j] -= buckets[i];
                buckets[i] = 1;
                result.pop_back();
            }
        }
    }
    return false; // No valid sequence found
}
```

Note that we are considering the cost of pouring as `(i - j)`, representing the distance between bucket `i` and bucket `j`. The modification should now ensure that backtracking restores the correct state, including the effort `e`.

The previous solutions did not provide the expected result because they did not correctly implement the logic to ensure the total effort matched `e`. The recursive approach is not suitable here due to the constraints of the problem, which require a more efficient solution for large `n` and `e`.

In this fixed solution, we work our way from the last bucket to the first, always choosing the furthest bucket to the left that we can pour into and still meet the effort requirement. The key is to pour in such a way that we always aim for the maximum distance we can achieve with the remaining effort. This requires understanding that the sequence of pours that will provide the needed effort is obtained by pouring the water in such a way that we double the water in each bucket from right to left.

Here's the new, fixed solution that should provide the expected result:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

std::ifstream fin("galeti.in");
std::ofstream fout("galeti.out");

int main() {
    long long n, e;
    fin >> n >> e;
    fin.close(); // Close input file after reading

    // We use a vector to store the pours
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> pours;
    
    // We start from the last bucket and try pouring it into the farthest possible bucket to the left
    for (int i = n; i > 1 && e > 0; --i) {
        // We find the target bucket to pour into
        int target = std::max(1LL, i - e);

        // The effort for this pour
        long long effort_for_pour = i - target;
        
        // Register the pour
        pours.emplace_back(i, target);
        
        // Subtract the effort
        e -= effort_for_pour;
    }
    
    // If we have used exactly the effort e, then we have a solution
    if (e == 0) {
        // Output the pours in reverse as we have calculated them from the last bucket
        for (const auto& pour : pours) {
            fout << pour.first << ' ' << pour.second << '\n';
        }
    } else {
        fout << "No solution\n";
    }

    fout.close(); // Close output file after writing
    return 0;
}
```

This solution calculates the pours in one pass, starting from the back and trying to pour into the farthest bucket we can without exceeding the effort `e`. If we finish and have used exactly `e` effort, we have a valid solution. If not, we output "No solution". This solution should meet the constraints and efficiently solve the problem for large inputs.

The issue with the previous solution is that the algorithm did not consider the most efficient way to pour the water into the first bucket using the exact amount of effort `e`. The expected output suggests that there's an optimal set of steps that combine a few large-effort pours with smaller-effort pours to achieve the exact total effort required.

The correct strategy should include the following observations:

1. The effort to pour from bucket `i` to bucket `j` is equal to the volume of water in bucket `i` multiplied by the difference in their indices `(i - j)`.
2. To use the exact effort `e`, we need to find a sequence of pours such that the sum of individual efforts equals `e`.

To achieve this, we can work backward from `n` to `1`, calculating the maximum amount of effort we can use at each step without exceeding the total `e`. Since we're pouring one bucket into another, and each bucket initially contains `1` liter of water, the effort at each step is the distance between the buckets.

Here's the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

std::ifstream fin("galeti.in");
std::ofstream fout("galeti.out");

int main() {
    long long n, e;
    fin >> n >> e;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>> operations;

    // Every bucket starts with 1 liter of water
    std::vector<long long> bucket(n + 1, 1);

    // We always pour the furthest bucket that we can afford with the remaining effort
    for (long long i = n; i > 1 && e > 0; --i) {
        if (e >= (i - 1)) {
            // Calculate available effort after pouring from bucket i to 1
            long long pour_effort = i - 1;
            e -= pour_effort * bucket[i];
            bucket[1] += bucket[i];
            bucket[i] = 0;
            operations.emplace_back(i, 1);
        } else {
            // Find the right bucket to pour into
            for (long long j = i - 1; j > 0 && e > 0; --j) {
                if ((i - j) <= e) {
                    // Pour from bucket i to bucket j
                    long long pour_effort = i - j;
                    e -= pour_effort * bucket[i];
                    bucket[j] += bucket[i];
                    bucket[i] = 0;
                    operations.emplace_back(i, j);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if all the water is in the first bucket and the effort is fully used
    if (bucket[1] == n && e == 0) {
        for (const auto& op : operations) {
            fout << op.first << " " << op.second << "\n";
        }
    } else {
        fout << "No solution\n";
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we carefully select which bucket to pour into by considering the remaining effort `e`. We start with the last bucket and try to pour it into the first bucket if we have enough effort. If not, we look for the furthest bucket to the left that we can pour into without exceeding the effort. This approach ensures we're using the maximum amount of effort at each step until we have exactly used up `e`.

When the loop ends, we check if all the water has been poured into the first bucket and if we have used exactly the effort `e`. If these conditions are met, we output the sequence of operations; otherwise, we indicate that there is no solution.

The previous solutions did not correctly solve the problem because they failed to account for the exact required effort `e` to pour the water from the rightmost bucket to the leftmost one, using exactly `e` units of effort. The expected output indicates a particular sequence of pours that achieves this effort.

To correct the solution, we need to identify the sequence of pours that would cumulatively add up to the exact effort `e`. A brute-force approach would not work due to the constraints of the problem (large `n` and `e` values), so we need a more efficient algorithm.

Let's try another approach:

1. Each bucket initially contains 1 liter of water.
2. We must find a sequence of pours that collectively use an exact total effort of `e`.
3. A pour from bucket `i` to bucket `j` uses effort equal to the amount of water in `i` times the number of buckets skipped, i.e., `a_i * (i - j)`.

We can visualize the problem as finding a path in a binary tree, where each level represents a bucket, and the value at each node represents the total effort used to reach that node. Given that the capacity of each bucket is infinite, the binary tree is actually skewed to the left, which means that each non-leaf node has only one child (the next bucket to the left which is not yet full). 

To keep track of the effort used, we can use a data structure that allows us to "undo" steps (i.e., backtracking), or we can calculate the number of steps that would lead us to the exact effort `e`. This can be done by repeatedly finding the highest power of 2 smaller than or equal to `e` and simulating a pour that doubles the water in a bucket.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("galeti.in");
    std::ofstream fout("galeti.out");
    
    long long n, e;
    fin >> n >> e;
    fin.close();

    // A sequence to hold the pours in reverse
    long long seq[n-1][2], idx = 0;
    
    // We use a greedy approach here
    for (int i = n; i >= 2; --i) {
        while (e >= (i-1)) {
            seq[idx][0] = i;          // Pouring from bucket
            seq[idx][1] = i - 1;      // Pouring into bucket
            idx++;
            e -= (i - 1);             // Subtract the effort
            // When pouring from bucket i to i-1, we merge the buckets
            // So the next pour will be from i-1 to i-2 and so on
        }
    }
    
    // If we used the exact effort e, output the sequence
    if (e == 0) {
        while (idx > 0) {
            idx--;

This solution uses a greedy approach to pour the water from each bucket into the leftmost bucket we can afford until we reach the leftmost bucket (bucket 1) or until we run out of effort. It takes into account the fact that each pour merges two buckets, so we can't just pour from bucket `i` to bucket `i-1` repeatedly; at some point, we need to pour from a non-adjacent bucket to bucket 1 to use the remaining effort. 

By storing the pours in reverse order, we can easily print out the pours in the correct order to meet the required effort `e`. If we can't meet `e` exactly, we print "No solution".

Let's re-evaluate the problem and devise a strategy that ensures we get the correct answer.

The correct approach involves recognizing a pattern of pouring that can be repeated to accumulate the required effort `e`. By repeatedly doubling the water in the second bucket and pouring it back into the first bucket until we have just enough effort left to pour the remaining buckets in sequence into the first bucket, we can achieve the exact effort `e`. This approach creates a binary-like pattern, where the water doubles at each step, leading to a logarithmic number of steps in terms of the volume of water being moved around.

Here's the corrected solution, implementing the binary-like pattern of pours:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

std::ifstream fin("galeti.in");
std::ofstream fout("galeti.out");

int main() {
    long long n, e;
    fin >> n >> e;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> pours;

    // Calculate the number of pours needed to double the water in the second bucket
    long long power = 1, total_pours = 0;
    while ((power << 1) <= n - 1) {
        power <<= 1;
        total_pours++;
    }

    // Now, simulate the pours to double the water in the second bucket
    long long remaining_effort = e - (n - 1 - power);
    if (remaining_effort >= 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < total_pours; ++i) {
            pours.emplace_back(power + i + 1, i + 2);
            pours.emplace_back(i + 2, 1);
        }
        // Pour the doubled water from the second to the first bucket
        pours.emplace_back(2, 1);

        // Pour the remaining buckets in sequence into the first bucket
        for (int i = 3; i <= n && remaining_effort >= (i - 1); ++i) {
            pours.emplace_back(i, 1);
            remaining_effort -= (i - 1);
        }

        // If we have used all the effort, output the pours
        if (remaining_effort == 0) {
            for (const auto& pour : pours) {
                fout << pour.first << " " << pour.second << "\n";
            }
        } else {
            fout << "No solution\n";
        }
    } else {
        fout << "No solution\n";
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution:

- We first find the number of pours needed to double the water in the second bucket (`total_pours`).
- We subtract the effort needed for the final pour from the second to the first bucket (`n - 1 - power`) from the total effort `e`.
- If we have enough remaining effort, we simulate pouring the water to double the second bucket and then pour it into the first bucket.
- Finally, we pour the remaining buckets directly into the first bucket in sequence until we run out of remaining effort.
- If we end up using exactly the effort `e`, we output the sequence of pours; otherwise, we output "No solution".

This solution should provide the correct sequence and match the expected output for the given input.
