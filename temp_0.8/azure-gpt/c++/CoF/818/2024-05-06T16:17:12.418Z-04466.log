Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

This code handles the logic of rotating the Ferris wheel, tracking which clients are in which cabins, and determining the order of exit and the last cabin to be exited. It writes the specified output to `roata.out` as per the problem's requirements.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that a program was terminated by the system, often due to excessive memory usage or because the process took too long to execute and was killed. Since the standard output and standard error don't provide specific information about the cause, the problem might be due to inefficiencies in the code or incorrect logic that leads to an infinite loop or excessive memory consumption.

Upon reviewing the previous code, the logic for decreasing rotations and loading new clients has a flaw. Moreover, we need to ensure that clients are loaded into cabins only when a cabin becomes available. Let's fix the logic and simplify the code.

I'll rewrite the entire solution with these fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

struct Client {
    int id;
    long long rotations;
};

std::ifstream fin("roata.in");
std::ofstream fout("roata.out");

int main() {
    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;
    std::vector<Client> cabins(n); // Represents clients in the cabins
    std::queue<Client> waiting;    // Queue for waiting clients
    std::vector<int> exit_order;   // Vector for the exit order of clients
    long long total_income = 0;
    int last_cabin = 0, client_id = 1;

    // Read clients and calculate total income
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        long long rotations;
        fin >> rotations;
        total_income += rotations;
        waiting.push({client_id++, rotations});
    }

    // Initial loading of the cabins
    for (int i = 0; i < n && !waiting.empty(); ++i) {
        cabins[i] = waiting.front();
        waiting.pop();
    }

    // Process the wheel rotations
    for (int rotations = 1; !waiting.empty() || rotations > 0; ++rotations) {
        int cabin_to_unload = (rotations - 1) % n; // Cabin to unload
        if (cabins[cabin_to_unload].rotations == rotations) {
            // Client exits
            exit_order.push_back(cabins[cabin_to_unload].id);
            last_cabin = cabin_to_unload;
            cabins[cabin_to_unload] = {0, 0}; // Clear the cabin
        }
        if (!waiting.empty() && cabins[cabin_to_unload].rotations == 0) {
            // Load a new client
            cabins[cabin_to_unload] = waiting.front();
            waiting.pop();
            // Reset rotations if we've loaded a new client
            rotations = 1;
        }
    }

    // Output the results
    fout << total_income << '\n';
    for (int client : exit_order) {
        fout << client << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n' << (last_cabin + 1) << '\n'; // +1 for 1-based cabin indexing

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This updated code should fix the previous issues and provide a working solution to the problem.

The exit code 137 indicates that the process received a SIGKILL signal, likely due to using too much memory or taking too long to execute. Since there is no output to stdout or stderr, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause within the logic of the program without additional debugging information. However, one common reason for such behavior is an infinite loop or a logic error that prevents the program from terminating as expected.

To address the issue, I'll make sure that the program logic is sound and that there are no infinite loops or excessive memory allocations. I will also optimize the program to handle the input/output operations more efficiently by avoiding the use of `std::endl`, which forces a flush of the output buffer, and instead using `'\n'` for newlines.

Here's the corrected and optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("roata.in");
    std::ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    long long total_income = 0;
    std::vector<long long> rotations(p); // To store the number of rotations for each client
    std::queue<int> clients_queue;       // To track the order of clients waiting to board
    std::vector<int> exit_order;         // To track the exit order of clients
    std::queue<int> cabins;              // To simulate the cabins

    // Read the number of rotations for each client and calculate total income
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
        total_income += rotations[i];
        clients_queue.push(i);
    }

    // Initialize the cabins with the first group of clients
    for (int i = 0; i < n && !clients_queue.empty(); ++i) {
        cabins.push(clients_queue.front());
        clients_queue.pop();
    }

    int last_cabin = 0; // To track the cabin from which the last client exits
    long long current_rotation = 0;

    // Process the clients as the wheel rotates
    while (!cabins.empty()) {
        int client = cabins.front();
        cabins.pop();

        // Decrease the rotation count for the current client
        rotations[client]--;

        // If the client's ride is over, add to exit order
        if (rotations[client] == 0) {
            exit_order.push_back(client + 1); // +1 for 1-based indexing
            last_cabin = (current_rotation % n) + 1; // +1 for 1-based indexing
        } else {
            // If the client still has rotations left, put them back in the queue
            cabins.push(client);
        }

        // Load the next client into the cabin, if available
        if (!clients_queue.empty() && cabins.size() < n) {
            cabins.push(clients_queue.front());
            clients_queue.pop();
        }

        current_rotation++;
    }

    // Write the output
    fout << total_income << '\n';
    for (int client_id : exit_order) {
        fout << client_id << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n' << last_cabin << '\n';

    // Close the file streams
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised version should be more efficient in terms of memory and execution time. I've replaced the previous logic with a simpler queue-based approach that simulates the rotation of the Ferris wheel without explicitly tracking each rotation. Clients are loaded and unloaded based on their remaining rotations, and we keep track of the last cabin to unload a client for the final output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is in the number of the cabin from which the last client exits. The expected output is "3", but the program outputs "1".

Upon reviewing the code, I found the mistake in the logic that calculates the last cabin. The way the `last_cabin` is being updated does not account for the fact that clients might exit from different cabins due to the way they are loaded and unloaded. The `current_rotation` variable is not the correct way to determine the cabin number because it represents the total number of rotations processed, not the index of the cabin from which the client exits.

To fix this issue, I will update the logic to correctly track the cabin from which each client exits. The cabin number should be determined based on the position of the client in the queue and the number of rotations they have left.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("roata.in");
    std::ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p + 1); // The number of rotations for each client (1-indexed)
    std::vector<int> exit_order;       // The order in which clients exit
    std::queue<int> cabins;            // Queue representing the cabins
    long long total_income = 0;
    int clients_served = 0, last_cabin = 0;

    // Read client rotations and calculate total income
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
        total_income += rotations[i];
    }

    // Load the initial clients into the cabins
    for (int i = 1; i <= n && clients_served < p; ++i) {
        cabins.push(i);
        clients_served++;
        rotations[i]--;
    }

    // Process the wheel rotations
    int current_rotation = 1;
    while (!cabins.empty()) {
        int current_cabin = cabins.front();
        cabins.pop();

        if (rotations[current_cabin] > 0) {
            rotations[current_cabin]--;
            cabins.push(current_cabin);
        } else {
            exit_order.push_back(current_cabin);
            if (clients_served < p) {
                cabins.push(clients_served + 1);
                rotations[clients_served + 1]--;
                clients_served++;
            }
        }
        
        // Keep track of the last cabin if all clients are served
        if (clients_served == p && rotations[current_cabin] == 0) {
            last_cabin = (current_rotation % n == 0) ? n : current_rotation % n;
        }

        current_rotation = current_rotation % n + 1; // Update rotation for next iteration
    }

    // Write the output to the file
    fout << total_income << '\n';
    for (int client : exit_order) {
        fout << client << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n' << last_cabin << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses a queue to simulate the cabins on the Ferris wheel and keeps track of the number of rotations remaining for each client. When a client finishes their rotations, they are removed from the queue (their cabin becomes empty), and a new client is loaded if available. The last cabin number is calculated by observing when the last client is served and using the modulus operator to determine the correct cabin number based on the current rotation.

The discrepancy between the expected and the actual output lies in the calculation of the cabin number from which the last client exits. The algorithm must correctly simulate filling and emptying the cabins while keeping track of the cabin number from which each client exits. In the previous solution, the calculation for the last cabin is incorrect.

To ensure the correct calculation of the last cabin, we need to:

1. Keep track of how many times each cabin has been filled. This can be done with an array or a vector that maps each cabin to the number of times it has been occupied.
2. When a client exits, determine the cabin from which they exit based on the total number of occupied positions and the total number of clients served so far.
3. Update the number of the last cabin each time a client exits.

Here's the corrected solution, with a better algorithm for determining the last cabin number:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("roata.in");
    std::ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> clients(p + 1); // Clients' rotations (1-indexed)
    std::vector<int> exit_order;     // Order of exiting clients
    std::queue<int> queue;           // Queue to simulate the cabins
    std::vector<int> cabin_clients(n + 1, 0); // Clients currently in cabins (1-indexed)
    long long total_income = 0;
    int client_idx = 1, current_cabin = 1, last_client = 0;

    // Read the number of rotations for each client and calculate total income
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        fin >> clients[i];
        total_income += clients[i];
        queue.push(i);
    }

    // Process the wheel rotations
    while (!queue.empty()) {
        int client = queue.front();
        queue.pop();

        // Check if this cabin is occupied and decrement rotations
        if (cabin_clients[current_cabin] != 0) {
            clients[cabin_clients[current_cabin]]--;
        }

        // If the client has finished their rotations, track the exit order
        if (clients[client] == 0) {
            exit_order.push_back(client);
            cabin_clients[current_cabin] = 0; // Empty the cabin
            last_client = current_cabin;
        } else {
            // The client has more rotations, put them back in the queue
            queue.push(client);
            cabin_clients[current_cabin] = client;
        }

        // Move to the next cabin
        current_cabin = current_cabin % n + 1;

        // Load a new client if the cabin is empty and there are clients waiting
        if (cabin_clients[current_cabin] == 0 && client_idx <= p) {
            cabin_clients[current_cabin] = client_idx;
            clients[client_idx]--;
            if (clients[client_idx] > 0) {
                queue.push(client_idx);
            } else {
                // The client has finished their rotations immediately
                exit_order.push_back(client_idx);
                last_client = current_cabin;
            }
            client_idx++;
        }
    }

    // Write the output
    fout << total_income << '\n';
    for (int idx : exit_order) {
        fout << idx << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n' << last_client << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution maintains a queue to manage the clients waiting to ride the wheel and a vector to keep track of which client is in which cabin. Each rotation, clients are either put back into the queue (if they have more rotations left) or removed (if they've finished), and new clients are loaded into empty cabins from the queue. When a client finishes all their rotations, the algorithm notes the cabin number they exited from, which is used to determine the last cabin number when all clients have exited.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was forcibly killed, often because it was using too much memory or too much CPU time. The lack of output to stdout or stderr means there are no explicit error messages to guide debugging. Given this, it is probable that the code has a logical flaw that is leading to an infinite loop or excessive resource consumption.

In the previously provided solution, an infinite loop could occur if the conditions for removing a client from the queue are not met, causing the queue to become stuck in a state where clients are neither being fully processed nor removed. Another potential issue could be improper handling of cabin occupancy, causing the algorithm to fail to accurately track when cabins become available and when clients should exit.

Let's simplify the solution to ensure that the algorithm correctly simulates the rotation of the Ferris wheel, keeps track of clients in the cabins, and accurately determines the cabin from which each client exits. Here's the reworked solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("roata.in");
    std::ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;
    
    std::vector<long long> rotations(p);
    std::vector<int> client_exit;     // Tracks the exit order of clients
    std::queue<int> client_queue;     // Queue of clients waiting to get on the wheel
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, 0);    // Track which client is in each cabin (0 for empty)
    long long total_income = 0;
    int last_cabin_exit = 1;          // Tracks the cabin from which the last client exits

    // Read client rotations and calculate total income
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
        total_income += rotations[i];
        client_queue.push(i + 1);     // Clients are 1-indexed

This solution simulates the Ferris wheel using a queue to manage the line of waiting clients and a vector to represent the cabins. Clients are loaded and unloaded as the wheel rotates, and the algorithm keeps track of the last cabin from which a client exits. When a client's ride is complete, they are removed from their cabin and the cabin is marked as empty. The wheel continues to rotate until all clients have exited. This should avoid any infinite loops and correctly calculate the last cabin.

The provided code still has a logical error causing the incorrect calculation of the cabin from which the last client exits and an incomplete exit order. The condition `!client_exit.size() == p` is incorrect and should be `client_exit.size() != p`.

Additionally, the code is intended to track the cabin from which each client exits. However, it only tracks the last cabin and doesn't properly handle the case when a cabin becomes empty, and a new client immediately takes that spot in the following iteration. 

Let's correct the solution with proper tracking of each cabin and ensure that clients are loaded into the cabins and tracked as they exit, finally calculating the correct cabin from which the last client exits.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("roata.in");
    std::ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p + 1);
    std::queue<int> client_queue; // Queue of clients waiting to ride the wheel
    std::vector<int> cabin(n + 1); // The cabins, indexed from 1 to n
    std::vector<int> exit_order; // The order in which clients finish
    long long total_income = 0;
    int next_client = 1; // The next client to board a cabin

    // Read the number of rotations for each client and calculate total income
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
        total_income += rotations[i];
    }

    // Load initial clients into the cabins if available
    for (int i = 1; i <= n && next_client <= p; ++i) {
        cabin[i] = next_client++;
        client_queue.push(i); // Cabin index in the queue
    }

    int last_cabin = 0; // The cabin from which the last client exits
    while (!client_queue.empty()) {
        int current_cabin = client_queue.front();
        client_queue.pop();

        // Reduce rotations for the client in the current cabin
        if (--rotations[cabin[current_cabin]] == 0) {
            // Client finished, mark the exit order and cabin
            exit_order.push_back(cabin[current_cabin]);
            last_cabin = current_cabin;
            cabin[current_cabin] = 0; // Clear the cabin

            // If there are more clients, load the next one into this cabin
            if (next_client <= p) {
                cabin[current_cabin] = next_client++;
                client_queue.push(current_cabin); // Push cabin back into the queue
            }
        } else {
            // Client has more rotations left, put the cabin back in the queue
            client_queue.push(current_cabin);
        }
    }

    // Write the output
    fout << total_income << '\n';
    for (int client : exit_order) {
        fout << client << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n' << last_cabin << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The revised solution maintains the order of clients as they finish their rides and accurately records the cabin from which they exit. It uses a queue to track the order of cabins as they become available and processes each client's rotations accordingly. Once a client's rotations are complete, they are marked in the exit order, and the cabin is either cleared or filled by the next waiting client. The cabin from which the last client exits is stored in `last_cabin`, and the exit order is correctly appended to the output file.
