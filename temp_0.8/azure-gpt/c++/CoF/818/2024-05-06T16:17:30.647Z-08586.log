Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

                    cabinClients[i] = 0;
                }
            }
            if (cabinClients[i] == 0 && !queue.empty()) {
                Client client = queue.front();
                queue.pop_front();
                cabinClients[i] = client.order;

    }
    out << '\n' << lastCabin << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The above C++ code provides a solution for the given programming challenge. It reads input from `roata.in` and writes the output to `roata.out` using file streams (`std::ifstream` and `std::ofstream`) instead of C++ standard I/O (`cin` and `cout`) or C I/O functions (`printf` and `scanf`). The program keeps track of the clients in line, their remaining rotations, and the state of the cabins (which client is in which cabin). It then proceeds to simulate the boarding and disembarking process, updating the states as needed. Finally, it outputs the total sum collected, the order in which clients leave the ferris wheel, and the cabin number where the last client disembarks.

Apologies for the oversight. The issue is that the `std::any_of` algorithm is not included by default, and we need to include the `<algorithm>` header to use it. Let me fix the code by including the necessary header and provide the entire source code again.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Client {
    int order;
    int rotations;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long sum = 0;

    in >> n >> p;
    std::list<Client> queue;
    std::vector<int> cabinClients(n, 0); // Keeps track of the current client in each cabin
    std::vector<int> clientRotations(p + 1, 0); // Keeps track of remaining rotations for each client
    std::vector<int> leavingOrder;
    leavingOrder.reserve(p);

    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        in >> ci;
        sum += ci;
        clientRotations[i] = ci;
        queue.push_back({i, ci});
    }

    int lastCabin = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n && !queue.empty(); ++i) { // Load initial cabins
        Client client = queue.front();
        queue.pop_front();
        cabinClients[i] = client.order;
    }

    while (!queue.empty() || std::any_of(cabinClients.begin(), cabinClients.end(), [](int i) { return i != 0; })) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabinClients[i] > 0) {
                --clientRotations[cabinClients[i]];
                if (clientRotations[cabinClients[i]] == 0) {
                    lastCabin = (i == n - 1) ? 1 : i + 2; // Adjusting for 1-based index and wrap around
                    leavingOrder.push_back(cabinClients[i]);
                    cabinClients[i] = 0;
                }
            }
            if (cabinClients[i] == 0 && !queue.empty()) {
                Client client = queue.front();
                queue.pop_front();
                cabinClients[i] = client.order;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output
    out << sum << '\n';
    for (int order : leavingOrder) {
        out << order << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n' << lastCabin << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This updated code now includes the `<algorithm>` header, which grants us access to the `std::any_of` function. Additionally, I have added a minor fix to ensure the cabin number wraps correctly from the last cabin back to the first.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, I can see that the final cabin number from which the last client disembarks is incorrect. The expected output is "3", but the found output is "4". 

The reason for this discrepancy is likely due to an off-by-one error in the way I calculated `lastCabin`. In my previous solution, I incremented the cabin number by one for the output, which is correct for a 1-based index, but I didn't account for the fact that the cabin number should wrap around to 1 when the last client is in the last cabin (in this case, cabin number 4).

Let's correct this by properly wrapping the cabin number and ensure that the last cabin number is computed correctly after the final rotation.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long sum = 0;

    in >> n >> p;
    std::queue<int> queue; // Queue for clients waiting for a cabin
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, 0); // Vector to keep track of rotations left for clients in cabins
    std::vector<int> leavingOrder; // Vector to store the leaving order of clients

    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        in >> ci;
        sum += ci;
        queue.push(ci);
    }

    int lastCabin = 0, clientsProcessed = 0;
    while (clientsProcessed < p) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabins[i] == 0) { // Check if the cabin is empty
                if (!queue.empty()) {
                    cabins[i] = queue.front();
                    queue.pop();
                }
            } else {
                cabins[i]--; // Decrement the rotations left for the client in the cabin
                if (cabins[i] == 0) { // If rotations for the client are done
                    leavingOrder.push_back(p - queue.size()); // Push the client's order of leaving
                    clientsProcessed++;
                    lastCabin = (i + 1); // Update the last cabin
                    if (!queue.empty()) { // Load the next client in the now empty cabin
                        cabins[i] = queue.front();
                        queue.pop();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Output
    out << sum << '\n';
    for (int order : leavingOrder) {
        out << order << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n' << lastCabin << '\n';

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, I've simplified the approach by using a `std::queue` to handle the clients waiting for a cabin. This queue is filled with the number of rotations each client has purchased. The `std::vector<int> cabins` keeps track of the remaining rotations for the client currently in each cabin.

The `while` loop now continues until all clients have been processed, decrementing the rotations left for each client in a cabin on each iteration, and when a client's rotations reach zero, we record their order of leaving and update the last cabin number. 

This should now provide the correct output with the last client disembarking from cabin 3, as expected.

The differences indicate that the client leaving order is incorrect. The expected output shows that each client should leave the wheel in a specific sequence based on their rotation count, but the found output repeats the last client multiple times, which is incorrect.

The bug in the previous solution lies in the way the leaving order of the clients was being determined. The value `p - queue.size()` does not give the correct order of the client leaving the wheel. Instead, we should be tracking the order number of the clients independently.

Let's fix the code by tracking the order number of clients correctly and ensure that the last cabin's number is derived from the position of the last client to leave, modulo the number of cabins.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long sum = 0;

    in >> n >> p;
    std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> queue; // Queue for clients along with their order number
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> cabins(n, {0, 0}); // Pair(rotation left, client order)
    std::vector<int> leavingOrder; // Vector to store the leaving order of clients

    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        in >> ci;
        sum += ci;
        queue.push({ci, i});
    }

    int clientsProcessed = 0, rotations = 0, lastCabin = 0;
    while (clientsProcessed < p) {
        rotations++; // Counting total rotations of the wheel
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabins[i].first == 0) { // Check if the cabin is empty
                if (!queue.empty()) {
                    cabins[i] = queue.front();
                    queue.pop();
                }
            } else {
                cabins[i].first--; // Decrement the rotations left for the client in the cabin
                if (cabins[i].first == 0) { // If rotations for the client are done
                    leavingOrder.push_back(cabins[i].second); // Push the client's order of leaving
                    clientsProcessed++;
                    lastCabin = (rotations % n == 0) ? n : rotations % n; // Update the last cabin
                    if (!queue.empty()) { // Load the next client in the now empty cabin
                        cabins[i] = queue.front();
                        queue.pop();
                    } else {
                        cabins[i] = {0, 0};
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Output
    out << sum << '\n';
    for (int order : leavingOrder) {
        out << order << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n' << ((lastCabin - 1 + n) % n) + 1 << '\n'; // Correct the cabin number considering the wrap around

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, the queue now stores pairs of integers representing the number of rotations and the client's order number. The `cabins` vector has been changed to store pairs of integers as well, where the first element is the number of rotations left and the second is the client's order number. This allows us to track and output the correct order in which clients leave the wheel.

The `lastCabin` calculation also takes into account the total rotations of the wheel, modulo the number of cabins, to determine the cabin from which the last client disembarks. The expression `((lastCabin - 1 + n) % n) + 1` ensures proper cabin indexing while taking care of the wrap-around scenario when the last cabin is `n`.

Upon reviewing the expected and found outputs, the error lies in the way the last cabin number is calculated. The leaving order of clients is correct, but the last cabin number is off. The expected cabin number from which the last client disembarks is "3", but my previous code provided "4".

The main issue stems from how the `lastCabin` variable is updated. The cabin number should be calculated based on the position of the wheel at the time the last client finishes their ride. Since the wheel stops when a client leaves, we can calculate the last cabin index based on the number of times clients have left cabins.

Let's fix this issue and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long sum = 0;
    in >> n >> p;

    std::queue<int> waiting; // Order numbers of waiting clients
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, 0); // Remaining rotations for clients in each cabin
    std::vector<int> orderLeaving; // Order numbers in the sequence of leaving
    std::vector<int> clientOrder(p + 1, 0); // The order number for each position in queue

    // Reading client rotations and calculating total sum
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        in >> ci;
        sum += ci;
        waiting.push(i);
        clientOrder[i] = ci;
    }

    int rounds = 0; // Total number of full rotations
    int lastCabinNumber = 0;
    while (!waiting.empty() || rounds < p) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // Iterate through each cabin
            if (cabins[i] == 0 && !waiting.empty()) { // If cabin is empty and clients are waiting
                int client = waiting.front(); // Get next client
                waiting.pop();
                cabins[i] = clientOrder[client]; // Assign rotations for the client
            }
            if (cabins[i] > 0) { // If there's a client in the cabin
                cabins[i]--; // Perform a rotation
                if (cabins[i] == 0) { // Client is finished
                    rounds++; // Increment full rotations
                    orderLeaving.push_back(rounds); // Add the order number to leaving sequence
                    lastCabinNumber = i + 1; // Update last cabin number (+1 for 1-indexed)
                    if (!waiting.empty()) { // If more clients are waiting
                        int client = waiting.front();
                        waiting.pop();
                        cabins[i] = clientOrder[client]; // Assign rotations for the next client
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Write results to file
    out << sum << '\n';
    for (int client : orderLeaving) {
        out << client << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n' << lastCabinNumber << '\n';

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this updated code, I'm tracking the number of full rotations (`rounds`) to correctly identify the cabin number from which clients leave, and I use this to update the `lastCabinNumber` accurately. The cabin numbers are 1-indexed as per the problem statement, so no further adjustment is needed. This should now provide the correct output as expected.

The program result does not match the expected result, indicating that the logic for determining the order in which clients leave the ferris wheel and the last cabin number is incorrect. The expected output shows a specific sequence for clients leaving, which corresponds to the order they finish their rides based on how many rotations they bought. However, the program output shows the clients leaving in the order they entered, which is not correct.

The last cabin number is also incorrect, as it should reflect the cabin from which the last client disembarks, not necessarily the number of the cabin where the last client was initially placed.

Let's correct the implementation. I will maintain a priority queue that holds the information about which client will leave next (based on the remaining rotations), and I will keep track of each cabin's current client number and rotations bought. When a cabin is free, we will take the next client from the waiting queue. If a client's rotations are completed, they will leave, and we will record the order of their departure.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

In this corrected solution, the `priority_queue` correctly keeps track of the next client to leave based on their remaining rotations. The sign of the rotations left is inverted to make it a min-heap so that the client with the fewest rotations left is at the top. The `waiting` queue holds clients waiting to board, and once a client leaves, if there are any waiting clients, the next one enters the wheel. The order of clients leaving and the last cabin from which a client disembarks are tracked and written to the output file. This code should now provide the expected output.

The issue in the found output is that clients are not leaving in the expected order. The result suggests that the data structure used to simulate the ride completion and client departure order is not accurately reflecting the actual behavior of the ferris wheel.

The ferris wheel should be simulated using a queue to represent the circular nature of the cabins and to ensure that clients leave in the correct order based on when their rides are completed. When a client's ride finishes, they leave, and the next client in the waiting queue takes their place. Additionally, we need to keep track of the total number of rotations to determine the cabin from which each client leaves.

Let's write a fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    long long sum = 0;

    in >> n >> p;
    std::vector<int> rotations(p + 1);
    std::queue<int> clients; // Queue for the client's orders
    std::vector<int> cabins(n); // Cabin occupancy by client order
    std::vector<int> leaveOrder; // Order of clients leaving the wheel

    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        in >> rotations[i];
        sum += rotations[i];
        clients.push(i);
    }

    // Load the initial cabins
    for (int i = 0; i < n && !clients.empty(); ++i) {
        int clientOrder = clients.front();
        clients.pop();
        cabins[i] = clientOrder;
    }

    int lastClientOrder = 0, totalRotations = 0, nextCabin = 0;
    while (leaveOrder.size() < p) {
        if (cabins[nextCabin] != 0) {
            rotations[cabins[nextCabin]]--; // Decrease rotations for client in cabin
            if (rotations[cabins[nextCabin]] == 0) { // Client's ride is over
                lastClientOrder = cabins[nextCabin];
                leaveOrder.push_back(lastClientOrder);
                cabins[nextCabin] = 0; // Cabin is now empty
            }
        }

        if (cabins[nextCabin] == 0 && !clients.empty()) { // Load next client into cabin
            cabins[nextCabin] = clients.front();
            clients.pop();
        }

        // Move to next cabin
        nextCabin++;
        if (nextCabin >= n) {
            nextCabin = 0;
            totalRotations++; // Completed one full rotation
        }
    }

    // Calculate the cabin number from which the last client will leave
    int lastCabin = (totalRotations * n + nextCabin - 1) % n + 1;

    // Write to output file
    out << sum << '\n';
    for (int order : leaveOrder) {
        out << order << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n' << lastCabin << '\n';

    // Close files
    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, I use a queue to simulate the order in which clients are waiting to board the ferris wheel. A vector `cabins` is used to keep track of which client is in each cabin, and `rotations` keep track of the remaining rotations for each client. The `leaveOrder` vector is used to record the order in which clients leave the ferris wheel.

When a client completes their ride, we note their order number and free the cabin. If there are clients waiting, we put the next client in the now-free cabin. We also keep track of the total rotations of the wheel to calculate the cabin from which the last client will leave.

This solution should now provide the correct output matching the expected result.
