Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it becomes apparent that there is a logical error in the implementation specifically in handling which client exits the cabin and how the cabin index is updated. The error occurs because my logic doesn't correctly account for the order in which clients exit the wheel, and it incorrectly updates cabinIndex for the last client.

Below is the correct implementation that fixes these issues:

- The clients' order must be tracked with their initial positions, not just the cabin rotations.
- After a client exits a cabin, the cabin must be replenished with the next client in the queue if available.
- The cabin index for the last client to exit must track the last cabin to have a client exit, not simply be incremented each loop iteration.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Client {
    int rotations;
    int order;
};

int main() {
    ifstream in("roata.in");
    ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long totalIncome = 0;
    in >> n >> p;

    vector<int> clientsOrder;
    vector<Client> cabins(n); // Store client info for each cabin
    queue<int> queueClients; // Store the order in which clients get on the wheel

    // Read the rotations bought by each client, and insert them into the queue
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        in >> ci;
        totalIncome += ci;
        queueClients.push(i);
    }
    in.close();

    int cabinIndex = 0; // This will hold the index of the cabin from which the last client will get off
    int clientsExited = 0; // Number of clients that have exited

    // Fill up the cabins with the first n clients or p if p < n
    for (int i = 0; i < min(n, p); ++i) {
        int clientOrder = queueClients.front();
        queueClients.pop();
        cabins[i] = { ci, clientOrder };
    }

    while (clientsExited < p) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabins[i].rotations > 0) {
                cabins[i].rotations--;
                if (cabins[i].rotations == 0) {
                    clientsOrder.push_back(cabins[i].order);
                    clientsExited++;
                    cabinIndex = i; // Update the cabin index when a client exits
                    if (!queueClients.empty()) {
                        int clientOrder = queueClients.front();
                        queueClients.pop();
                        in >> ci;
                        cabins[i] = { ci, clientOrder };
                    } else {
                        cabins[i] = { 0, 0 }; // Mark the cabin as empty
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the total income and the order of clients exiting the wheel
    out << totalIncome << "\n";
    for (int order : clientsOrder) {
        out << order << " ";
    }
    out << "\n";

    // Write the number of the last cabin from which a client exits
    out << (cabinIndex + 1) % n << "\n"; // Correct cabin index calculation
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly output the total income, the order of clients exiting, and the cabin number from which the last client exits.

The differences between the expected and found result indicate that the order in which clients exit the wheel is incorrect. The main issue lies in the order of clients being displaced directly by their order of entering, without considering the number of rides each client bought.

The other issue is that the cabin index should reflect the cabin from which the last client exits, and it is not handled correctly.

The logic needs to be updated to ensure that the clients are exiting in the correct order, taking into account the number of rotations each client has purchased. This requires tracking the client's order and the number of rotations left for that client within each cabin.

Let's fix the implementation with the following changes:

- We will use a priority_queue to handle the order of clients exiting, which will be ordered by the rotation at which they will exit.
- We will need to track the current rotation to calculate the exit rotation for each client.

Here is the rewritten and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("roata.in");
    ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long totalIncome = 0;
    in >> n >> p;

    // Priority queue to store the exit times along with the client order, sorted by exit time.
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> exitTimes;

    vector<int> clientsOrder;
    queue<int> clientsQueue; // Queue to manage clients waiting to get on the wheel
    int lastCabin = 0; // The cabin number from which the last client exits

    // Current rotation counter, represents the current rotation of the wheel
    int currentRotation = 0;

    // Read the number of rotations for each client and fill the queue
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        in >> ci;
        totalIncome += ci;
        clientsQueue.push(i + 1);
        // Calculate when the client will exit based on current rotation
        exitTimes.emplace(currentRotation + ci, i + 1);
        // If there's an empty cabin, the client gets on the wheel immediately
        if (i < n) {
            currentRotation++;
        }
    }
    in.close();

    // Processing client exits
    while (!exitTimes.empty()) {
        int exitTime, clientOrder;
        tie(exitTime, clientOrder) = exitTimes.top();
        exitTimes.pop();
        clientsOrder.push_back(clientOrder);
        lastCabin = exitTime % n;

        // If there are more clients waiting and cabins available
        if (!clientsQueue.empty()) {
            int nextClientOrder = clientsQueue.front();
            clientsQueue.pop();
            // Schedule the next client's exit
            exitTimes.emplace(exitTime + ci, nextClientOrder);
        }
    }

    // Write results to file
    out << totalIncome << "\n";
    for (int order : clientsOrder) {
        out << order << " ";
    }
    out << "\n" << (lastCabin == 0 ? n : lastCabin) << "\n"; // Correct cabin number
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly process the exit times and client order based on the rotations purchased, and it should produce the correct output for the input provided.

The output still does not match the expected result. The issue seems to be with the logic of handling the rotations and the exit times of clients from the cabins.

To fix the issue, let's refactor the approach:

- The exit times for clients need to be handled in a way that takes into account the number of rotations each client has purchased and the availability of cabins.
- We'll use a queue to simulate the waiting line of clients.
- We'll use a vector to keep track of the cabins and their occupancy status.
- We'll use a vector to store the exit order of the clients.

Here is the rewritten and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Open the input and output files
    ifstream in("roata.in");
    ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    in >> n >> p;

    vector<int> rotations(p); // Stores rotations for each client
    vector<int> exitOrder; // Stores the order in which clients exit
    queue<int> cabinQueue; // Stores clients currently in the cabins
    long long totalIncome = 0;
    int clientsExited = 0, lastClient = 0, currentCabin = 1;

    // Read client rotations and compute total income
    for (int i = 0; i < p; i++) {
        in >> rotations[i];
        totalIncome += rotations[i];
    }
    in.close();

    vector<int> cabinClients(n, 0); // Stores the current client in each cabin
    vector<int> rotationCount(n, 0); // Stores remaining rotations for the client in the cabin

    // Fill cabins initially
    for (int i = 0; i < min(n, p); i++) {
        cabinClients[i] = i + 1;
        rotationCount[i] = rotations[i];
        cabinQueue.push(i + 1);
    }

    // While there are clients who haven't exited
    while (clientsExited < p) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (rotationCount[i] > 0) {
                rotationCount[i]--; // Decrement rotation count for the client in the cabin
                if (rotationCount[i] == 0) {
                    // Client exits the cabin
                    exitOrder.push_back(cabinClients[i]);
                    clientsExited++;
                    lastClient = cabinClients[i];
                    cabinQueue.pop();
                    // If there are still clients waiting
                    if (clientsExited + cabinQueue.size() < p) {
                        int nextClient = clientsExited + cabinQueue.size() + 1;
                        cabinQueue.push(nextClient);
                        cabinClients[i] = nextClient;
                        rotationCount[i] = rotations[nextClient - 1];
                    } else {
                        cabinClients[i] = 0; // Cabin is empty
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        currentCabin = (currentCabin % n) + 1; // Move to the next cabin

    // Write the cabin number from which the last client exits
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (cabinClients[i] == lastClient) {
            out << ((i + 1) % n ? (i + 1) : n) << '\n';
            break;
        }
    }
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should now simulate the wheel and clients properly, recording the income, the order in which clients exit, and the cabin number from which the last client exits, producing the correct output for the given input.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's address the missing part of the solution and ensure we correctly determine the cabin from which the last client exits.

To ensure we track the last client's cabin correctly:

- We must remember that the rotation of the wheel doesn't necessarily correspond to the number of clients that have exited because clients may have different numbers of rotations purchased.
- We need to track the total number of rotations made by the wheel and identify the cabin from which the last client exits after their final rotation.
- We should maintain a counter of how many rotations each cabin has made and update it as the wheel spins.

Now let's fix the solution with these points in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 360;
int cabin[MAXN]; // The client in each cabin

int main() {
    ifstream in("roata.in");
    ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long totalIncome = 0;
    in >> n >> p;

    vector<int> exitOrder; // The order in which clients exit the wheel
    vector<int> rotations(p + 1); // The number of rotations each client purchased
    queue<int> waitingClients; // Queue for the clients waiting to get on the wheel

    for (int i = 1; i <= p; i++) {
        in >> rotations[i];
        totalIncome += rotations[i];
        waitingClients.push(i); // Initially, all clients are waiting
    }
    in.close();

    int currentRotation = 0; // The current rotation of the wheel
    int lastClient = 0; // The last client to get off

    // Initialize the cabins with the first n clients
    for (int i = 0; i < n && !waitingClients.empty(); i++) {
        int client = waitingClients.front();
        waitingClients.pop();
        cabin[i] = client;
        rotations[client]--;
        if (rotations[client] == 0) { // This client will get off after one rotation
            exitOrder.push_back(client);
            lastClient = client;
        }
    }

    // Start rotating the wheel
    while (exitOrder.size() < (size_t)p) {
        currentRotation++; // Next rotation
        int cabinIndex = currentRotation % n; // Current cabin to unload/load
        if (cabin[cabinIndex] != 0) { // If there's a client to get off
            int client = cabin[cabinIndex];
            if (rotations[client] == 0) {
                exitOrder.push_back(client);
                lastClient = client;
                if (!waitingClients.empty()) { // If there are clients waiting
                    cabin[cabinIndex] = waitingClients.front();
                    waitingClients.pop();
                    rotations[cabin[cabinIndex]]--; // Client has used one rotation
                    if (rotations[cabin[cabinIndex]] == 0) { // If client has no more rotations
                        // They will get off in the next round here
                        lastClient = cabin[cabinIndex];
                    }
                } else {
                    cabin[cabinIndex] = 0; // No more clients, mark cabin as empty
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Output total income
    out << totalIncome << '\n';
    // Output the exit order of clients
    for (int client : exitOrder) {
        out << client << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';
    // Output the cabin number from which the last client exits
    out << ((currentRotation - 1) % n + 1) << '\n';

    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution fixes the loop to ensure we correctly update the cabins as the wheel rotates and handle the clients boarding and alighting to correctly output the total income, the order in which clients exit, and the cabin from which the last client exits.

Exit code 137 typically means that the program was killed because it used more memory than it was allowed to or took too much time to run, which can happen if there's an infinite loop or some form of unbounded resource usage in the program.

Upon reviewing the previous implementation, the issue might be with the way the rotation of the wheel was handled. There may be infinite loops caused by not properly updating the state of the cabins or the rotations remaining for clients.

Let's implement a more efficient solution that avoids potential infinite loops by carefully managing the state of the cabins and ensuring that we correctly decrement the rotations and manage the waiting queue of clients.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("roata.in");
    ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p, ci;
    long long totalIncome = 0;
    in >> n >> p;

    vector<int> rotations(p + 1);
    queue<int> clients;
    vector<int> exitOrder;
    vector<pair<int, int>> cabins(n + 1, make_pair(0, 0)); // Pair of client number and rotations left

    // Read clients' rotations and enqueue them
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        in >> ci;
        totalIncome += ci;
        rotations[i] = ci;
        clients.push(i);
    }
    in.close();

    int lastCabin = 0; // Track last cabin number
    int currentCabin = 0; // Cabin where boarding happens
    for (int time = 1; !clients.empty() || time <= p; ++time) {
        // Client exits cabin
        if (cabins[currentCabin].second == 1) {
            exitOrder.push_back(cabins[currentCabin].first);
            lastCabin = currentCabin;
            cabins[currentCabin] = make_pair(0, 0); // Mark cabin as empty
        }

        // Rotate cabins
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabins[i].second > 0) cabins[i].second--;
        }

        // Board new client if cabin is empty and clients are waiting
        if (cabins[currentCabin].first == 0 && !clients.empty()) {
            int client = clients.front();
            clients.pop();
            cabins[currentCabin] = make_pair(client, rotations[client]);
        }

        // Move to next cabin for next time
        currentCabin = (currentCabin + 1) % n;
    }

    // Calculate the total income and write to the file
    out << totalIncome << '\n';
    for (int client : exitOrder) {
        out << client << " ";
    }
    out << '\n';
    out << (lastCabin == 0 ? n : lastCabin) << '\n';

    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code carefully manages the entrance and exit of clients from the cabins with a queue, keeps track of the rotations left for each client, and updates the cabin status as the wheel rotates. It also ensures that the cabin number from which the last client exits is correctly determined. This should avoid any infinite loops and resource usage issues, thereby preventing the program from being killed with exit code 137.

Exit code 137 indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system, typically due to excessive memory usage or exceeding a memory limit, as would be the case on some online judges or in a containerized environment. This can be caused by a memory leak, or more likely in this context, by an infinite loop or an algorithm that's vastly inefficient.

The lack of output on both stdout and stderr suggests that the program did not encounter a typical runtime error; rather, it might be stuck in an infinite loop.

Let's write a solution that ensures the cabin states are managed correctly, avoiding any infinite loops.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    in >> n >> p;
    
    std::queue<Client> clients;
    std::vector<int> exitOrder;
    std::vector<Client> cabins(n);
    long long totalIncome = 0;
    int nextClientId = 1;

    // Read clients' rotations and enqueue them
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        int rotations;
        in >> rotations;
        totalIncome += rotations;
        clients.push({nextClientId++, rotations});
    }
    in.close();

    int rotationsCompleted = 0;
    int lastCabinIndex = -1;  // Stores the last cabin index from where client exits

    // Initially fill the cabins
    for (int i = 0; i < n && !clients.empty(); ++i) {
        cabins[i] = clients.front();
        clients.pop();
    }

    // Process the rotations
    while (rotationsCompleted < p) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Check if any client needs to exit
            if (cabins[i].rotations == 1) {
                // Mark the cabin from where the client will exit
                lastCabinIndex = i;
                exitOrder.push_back(cabins[i].id);
                rotationsCompleted++;
                // Load the next client into the cabin if available
                if (!clients.empty()) {
                    cabins[i] = clients.front();
                    clients.pop();
                } else {
                    cabins[i] = {0, 0};  // Mark cabin as empty
                }
            }
            // Rotate the wheel by decreasing the rotations for each client
            if (cabins[i].id != 0) cabins[i].rotations--;
        }
    }

    // Output the results
    out << totalIncome << '\n';
    for (int clientId : exitOrder) {
        out << clientId << ' ';
    }
    out << '\n';
    out << (lastCabinIndex + 1) << '\n';  // Cabin numbers are 1-indexed

    out.close();
    return 0;
}

```

In this implementation, I've introduced a `Client` struct to keep track of the client id and rotations in a structured way. I've also made sure that the cabin index is updated correctly when clients exit and the next available client boards the cabin. The loop runs until the number of completed rotations matches the number of clients. This ensures the algorithm is efficient and avoids any infinite loops.

This solution should avoid the previous problem and generate the correct output as per the problem statement.
