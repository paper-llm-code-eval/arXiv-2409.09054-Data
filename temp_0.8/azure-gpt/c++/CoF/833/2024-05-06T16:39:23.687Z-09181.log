Având mai multe cuburi la dispoziție, Crina și Rareș au hotărât să construiască clădiri prin alipirea a două sau mai multor turnuri. Turnurile au fost obținute prin așezarea cuburilor unul peste celălalt. **Înălțimea unui turn** este dată de numărul de cuburi din care este format. Clădirile construite au fost așezate în linie, una lângă alta formând astfel o stradă, pe care cei doi copii se vor plimba.

~[cladiri.png|width=40em]

Pentru numerotarea clădirilor Crina și Rareș au stabilit următoarele reguli:
* Crina pornește dintr-un capăt al străzii iar Rareș din celălalt capăt al acesteia; fiecare dintre ei traversează strada complet, trecând prin dreptul fiecărei clădiri
* Crina lipește pe fiecare clădire, câte un bilețel pe care scrie înălțimea turnurilor din care aceasta este construită, în ordinea în care ea le vede când trece prin dreptul lor (de exemplu, pentru imaginea de mai sus, Crina va lipi pe prima clădire un bilețel pe care va scrie numărul $3112$ deoarece, primul turn e format din $3$ cuburi, următoarele două turnuri ale acestei clădiri sunt formate din câte un cub iar cel de-al patrulea turn e format din $2$ cuburi);
* Rareș va proceda la fel, dar începe plimbarea din celalalt capăt al străzii. În exemplul din imagine, el va lipi pe prima clădire pe care o întâlnește un bilețel pe care scrie numărul $2121$.

La finalul plimbării, Crina și Rareș își dau seama că există clădiri pe care au lipit amândoi bilețele cu numere identice.

# Cerință

1. Care este înălțimea celui mai înalt turn și care este numărul clădirilor care au în construcția lor un astfel de turn;
2. Care este numărul clădirilor pe care cei doi copii au lipit bilețele cu numere identice;
3. Care este cel mai mic număr de cuburi necesar pentru **a completa** clădirile astfel încât, pe fiecare clădire bilețelul pe care îl va lipi Crina să conțină același număr cu cel pe care îl va lipi Rareș. Cuburile din care a fost construită inițial clădirea nu se pot muta.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `cladiri.in` se va citi de pe prima linie un număr natural $N$, reprezentând numărul clădirilor de pe stradă iar de pe următoarele $N$ linii, câte un număr natural cu toate cifrele nenule, reprezentând numerele scrise de Crina pe bilețele, în ordinea în care au fost lipite de ea pe clădiri.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `cladiri.out` se va scrie pe prima linie două numere naturale despărțite printr-un singur spațiu ce reprezintă, în ordine, valorile cerute la cerința $1$. Pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie un număr natural, mai mare sau egal cu zero reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$ iar pe cea de-a treia linie a fișierului se va scrie un număr natural mai mare sau egal cu zero reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $3$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Fiecare clădire este alcătuită din cel mult $9$ turnuri, iar înălțimea fiecărui turn este exprimată printr-o cifră nenulă.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $20$% din punctajul fiecărui test, pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $40$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $3$ se acordă 40% din punctajul fiecărui test.
* Respectați formatul fișierului de ieșire! Pentru a obține punctajul acordat unei cerințe, trebuie ca răspunsul din fișier să fie corect și scris exact pe linia precizată în enunț.

This C++ program reads from `cladiri.in` and writes to `cladiri.out` as required. It implements the logic in the most time-efficient way given the constraints of the problem. It does this by utilizing an unordered_map to keep track of buildings already seen, which allows for constant-time lookup to count identical buildings. The program also iterates through each building only once to achieve all tasks in a single pass.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it's clear that there are a couple of issues in the original solution:

1. The number of buildings with the highest towers is overcounted. We should not be simply incrementing the `buildings_with_max_height` counter when we find a tower of max height; instead, we should be counting the number of buildings that contain at least one tower with the max height.

2. The program does not correctly identify identical buildings. When we check for the reverse of the building, we should be incrementing the `identical_buildings` only if the reverse building equals the original building, not just if it exists in the map.

These issues need to be rectified to match the expected output.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cladiri.in");
    std::ofstream out("cladiri.out");

    int N, max_height = 0, buildings_with_max_height = 0, identical_buildings = 0, cubes_to_add = 0;
    in >> N;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> buildings;
    std::unordered_set<int> max_height_buildings;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::string building;
        in >> building;

        // Calculate the highest tower and its occurrences.
        int current_building_max_height = 0;
        for (char c : building) {
            int height = c - '0';
            current_building_max_height = std::max(current_building_max_height, height);
        }
        if (current_building_max_height > max_height) {
            max_height = current_building_max_height;
            max_height_buildings.clear();
            max_height_buildings.insert(i);
        } else if (current_building_max_height == max_height) {
            max_height_buildings.insert(i);
        }

        // Check if reverse of the building exists and is identical.
        std::string reversed_building = building;
        std::reverse(reversed_building.begin(), reversed_building.end());
        if (reversed_building == building) {
            ++identical_buildings;
        } else if (buildings.find(reversed_building) != buildings.end()) {
            ++identical_buildings;
        }

        // Add to the hash map.
        buildings[building] = i;

        // Find the number of cubes to add to make the building identical from both sides.
        int s = 0;
        for (size_t j = 0; j < building.length() / 2; ++j) {
            int front = building[j] - '0';
            int back = building[building.length() - j - 1] - '0';
            s += std::max(front, back) - front + std::max(front, back) - back;
        }
        if (building.length() % 2 != 0) {
            s += building[building.length() / 2] - '0';
        }
        cubes_to_add += s;
    }

    buildings_with_max_height = max_height_buildings.size();

    out << max_height << " " << buildings_with_max_height << "\n";
    out << identical_buildings << "\n";
    out << cubes_to_add << "\n";

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Changes made to the solution:

1. Introduced `max_height_buildings` set to track buildings containing the tallest tower without duplicating counts.
2. Fixed the logic for counting identical buildings by checking if the reversed building is identical to the original building.
3. Adjusted the cube addition logic to handle buildings with an odd number of towers properly.

The error message indicates that the `reverse` function from the C++ standard library is not being recognized by the compiler. This is because I forgot to include the appropriate header that defines the `reverse` function.

The solution is to include the `<algorithm>` header, which contains the definition for `std::reverse`.

Upon reviewing the expected vs. actual output, it seems that the code for calculating the number of cubes needed to add to make buildings identical was incorrect. It was mistakenly adding cubes for the middle tower in buildings with an odd number of towers, which should not be changed. 

Let's correct this section of the code. We will only be adding cubes to the shorter of the two towers when matching the left and right sides of a building (when viewed from the middle). If the number of towers is odd, the middle tower is already symmetric and does not need extra cubes.

Here is the corrected solution with the necessary fix applied:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm> // for std::reverse

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cladiri.in");
    std::ofstream out("cladiri.out");

    int N, max_height = 0, buildings_with_max_height = 0, identical_buildings = 0, cubes_to_add = 0;
    in >> N;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> height_counts;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::string building;
        in >> building;

        // Calculate the highest tower and its occurrences.
        for (char c : building) {
            int height = c - '0';
            height_counts[std::string(1, c)]++; // Count each height
            max_height = std::max(max_height, height);
        }

        // Check if reversed building has been encountered.
        std::string reversed_building = building;
        std::reverse(reversed_building.begin(), reversed_building.end());
        if (building == reversed_building) {
            identical_buildings++; // Building is the same when viewed from both sides
        }
        else if (height_counts[reversed_building] > 0) {
            identical_buildings++; // Reversed building has been seen before
            height_counts[reversed_building]--; // Decrement count to avoid double-counting
        }

        // Calculate cubes needed to add to make buildings identical from both sides.
        int half_len = building.length() / 2;
        for (int j = 0; j < half_len; ++j) {
            int left = building[j] - '0';
            int right = building[building.length() - j - 1] - '0';
            cubes_to_add += std::abs(left - right);
        }
    }

    buildings_with_max_height = height_counts[std::string(1, '0' + max_height)];

    out << max_height << " " << buildings_with_max_height << "\n";
    out << identical_buildings << "\n";
    out << cubes_to_add << "\n";

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The `height_counts` map is now being used to keep track of how many times each particular height (as a string) has been seen, which allows for counting the number of buildings with the maximum height. The calculation of cubes to add has been corrected to only consider the difference in height between the left and right sides of each building. 

This updated solution should provide the correct output according to the expected results.

The discrepancy in the output is due to incorrect tracking of the number of buildings with the maximum height. The current approach is counting the occurrences of the maximum height among all towers in all buildings, rather than counting the number of buildings that have at least one tower of maximum height. We should change the strategy to check each building for the presence of the maximum height and increment the buildings_with_max_height counter accordingly.

Furthermore, the handling of identical buildings is not accurate. We should use a separate map to count buildings as we see them and paired reversed buildings to correctly count identical buildings.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm> // for std::max

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cladiri.in");
    std::ofstream out("cladiri.out");

    int N, max_height = 0, buildings_with_max_height = 0, identical_buildings = 0, cubes_to_add = 0;
    in >> N;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> building_counts;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, bool> max_height_in_building;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::string building;
        in >> building;

        // Calculate the highest tower and its occurrences.
        bool has_max_height = false;
        for (char c : building) {
            int height = c - '0';
            if (height > max_height) {
                max_height = height;
                has_max_height = true;
            } else if (height == max_height) {
                has_max_height = true;
            }
        }
        if (has_max_height) {
            max_height_in_building[building] = true;
        }

        // Count the buildings already seen and their reversed forms.
        std::string reversed_building = building;
        std::reverse(reversed_building.begin(), reversed_building.end());
        building_counts[reversed_building]++;

        // If we've seen the reversed building before, it's identical.
        if (building_counts[building] > 0) {
            identical_buildings++;
            building_counts[building]--;
        }

        // Calculate cubes needed to add to make buildings identical from both sides.
        int half_len = building.size() / 2;
        for (int j = 0; j < half_len; ++j) {
            int left = building[j] - '0';
            int right = building[building.size() - j - 1] - '0';
            cubes_to_add += std::max(left, right) - left + std::max(left, right) - right;
        }
    }

    // Count the number of buildings with at least one tower of maximum height.
    for (const auto& pair : max_height_in_building) {
        if (pair.second) {
            buildings_with_max_height++;
        }
    }

    out << max_height << " " << buildings_with_max_height << "\n";
    out << identical_buildings << "\n";
    out << cubes_to_add << "\n";

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this fixed solution:

1. A map called `max_height_in_building` is used to flag if a building contains the max height. After processing all buildings, we count the number of buildings that contain the max height.

2. We correctly identify identical buildings by using the `building_counts` map to increment when we see a reversed building and decrement when we see a building that matches the reversed form.

3. The calculation of cubes to add is reverted back to the correct logic of adding cubes to make the two sides identical.

With these corrections, the program should now produce the expected output.

The output still does not match the expected result because the current code is incorrectly calculating the number of buildings with the maximum height. It counts buildings that have the maximum height multiple times if they contain more than one tower with the maximum height.

To fix this, I will use a separate boolean variable for each building to mark if the maximum height is found. This will ensure that each building is only counted once for having a tower of maximum height, regardless of how many towers of that height it contains.

Let's correct the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

In this corrected solution:

1. We use a vector `has_max_height` to track whether a building contains the maximum height tower. This ensures each building is only counted once.
2. We calculate cubes needed to add to make buildings identical from both sides using the `building_counts` map for buildings that have not been matched as identical.
3. We separate the checks for the maximum height and the record of buildings containing it to avoid overcounting buildings with multiple maximum height towers.

This corrected code should provide the expected output according to the challenge.

The discrepancy in the output is due to an error in the way we count the number of buildings that contain at least one tower of the maximum height. The current approach marks a building as having the maximum height for each tower that matches the maximum height, which could lead to overcounting if a single building has multiple towers of the same maximum height. We need to correct this by ensuring that each building is counted only once, regardless of how many towers of the maximum height it has.

Additionally, the approach for identifying identical buildings is incorrect because the program decrements the count for any reversed building found, which could lead to undercounting.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm> // for std::max

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cladiri.in");
    std::ofstream out("cladiri.out");

    int N, max_height = 0, buildings_with_max_height = 0, identical_buildings = 0, cubes_to_add = 0;
    in >> N;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> building_to_index;
    std::unordered_map<int, bool> building_has_max;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::string building;
        in >> building;

        // Calculate the highest tower.
        for (char c : building) {
            int height = c - '0';
            max_height = std::max(max_height, height);
        }

        // Check if reversed building has been encountered.
        std::string reversed_building = building;
        std::reverse(reversed_building.begin(), reversed_building.end());

        // Update identical buildings count and building to index map.
        if (building_to_index.count(reversed_building) && building_to_index[reversed_building] != i) {
            identical_buildings++;
            // Mark buildings as processed to avoid double counting.
            building_to_index.erase(reversed_building);
        } else {
            building_to_index[building] = i;
        }

        // Calculate cubes needed to add to make buildings identical from both sides.
        for (size_t j = 0, k = building.size() - 1; j < k; ++j, --k) {
            int left = building[j] - '0';
            int right = building[k] - '0';
            cubes_to_add += std::max(left, right) - std::min(left, right);
        }
    }

    // Count the number of buildings with at least one tower of maximum height.
    for (const auto& entry : building_to_index) {
        const std::string& building = entry.first;
        if (building.find(char(max_height + '0')) != std::string::npos) {
            buildings_with_max_height++;
        }
    }

    out << max_height << " " << buildings_with_max_height << "\n";
    out << identical_buildings << "\n";
    out << cubes_to_add << "\n";

    in.close();
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution:

1. We use a map `building_to_index` to keep track of buildings and their corresponding indices. This way we can ensure that we're not counting a building as identical to itself.
2. We only count a building as having the maximum height if it contains a tower of that height, and we only count each building once by checking if it contains the maximum height character.
3. We've corrected the calculation of cubes to add to make buildings identical from both sides, ensuring we don't double-count cubes for the middle tower when the number of towers is odd. We do this by using two pointers to iterate from both ends towards the center.

This corrected code should now provide the expected output.
