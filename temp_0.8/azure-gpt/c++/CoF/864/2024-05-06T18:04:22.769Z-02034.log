# Cerință
Cunoscând un număr natural $N$ afișat cu ajutorul mai multor indicatoare numerice, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. Numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.
2. Numărul de numere distincte mai **mari** decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în **plus** față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice și fără a stinge niciun segment dintre cele deja aprinse.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare este `cifre.in`.

Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.

Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire este `cifre.out`.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând numărul de numere distincte mai mari decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în plus, față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq N \leq 10^{19}$
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea $V = 2$.

This C++ solution reads the input from `cifre.in` and writes the output to `cifre.out` without using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf`. It utilizes file streams to handle I/O operations. The solution consists of two functions: `count_segments`, which calculates the number of segments lit up for a given number, and `count_distinct_numbers`, which calculates the number of distinct numbers greater than the given number that can be formed by lighting up more segments. The main function reads the input, processes it according to the value of `V`, and writes the corresponding output.

The reason for the discrepancy between the expected and found result is an incorrect interpretation of the rule for forming greater numbers. The rule states that we can only form numbers by lighting up additional segments, without using any new indicators or turning off any previously lit segments. The initial solution incorrectly counted the possible numbers for each digit independently without considering the context of the entire number. We need to adjust the logic to consider the sequence of the number and the constraints of forming a larger number.

To fix the solution, we need to iterate over the number from the highest place value to the lowest and, for each digit, count the distinct numbers that can be formed that are greater than the current digit, while also not leading to a smaller number overall. Once a higher number is formed, all subsequent digits can use all possible additional numbers, ignoring the current state of the digit.

Here is the fixed and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Mapping of digit to the number of lit segments
const int segments_count[] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Possible digits that can be formed by adding more segments to the current digit
const int additional_numbers[][10] = {
    {},                                       // 0 (placeholder)
    {},                                       // 1 (placeholder)
    {8},                                      // 2 can form 8
    {8, 9},                                   // 3 can form 8 or 9
    {8, 9},                                   // 4 can form 8 or 9
    {6, 8, 9},                                // 5 can form 6, 8, or 9
    {8},                                      // 6 can form 8
    {0, 3, 8, 9},                             // 7 can form 0, 3, 8, or 9
    {},                                       // 8 (placeholder)
    {8}                                       // 9 can form 8
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cifre.in");
    std::ofstream out("cifre.out");

    int V;
    std::string N;

    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    if (V == 1) {
        int total_segments = 0;
        for (char digit : N) {
            total_segments += segments_count[digit - '0'];
        }
        out << total_segments << '\n';
    } else if (V == 2) {
        long long count = 0;
        bool found_higher = false;
        
        for (size_t i = 0; i < N.length(); ++i) {
            int digit = N[i] - '0';
            int additional_count = 0;
            
            if (!found_higher) {
                for (int num : additional_numbers[digit]) {
                    if (num > digit) {
                        ++additional_count;
                    }
                }
                
                // Once a higher number is formed, all subsequent digits can use all possible additional numbers
                if (additional_count > 0) {
                    found_higher = true;
                    count += additional_count * (1LL << (N.length() - i - 1)); // Use bitwise shift for powers of 2
                }
            } else {
                // All digits except 8 can form a number with more segments
                if (digit != 8)
                    count += (1LL << (N.length() - i - 1)); // Use bitwise shift for powers of 2
            }
        }

        out << count << '\n';
    }

    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution first reads `V` and `N` from `cifre.in` and then closes the input file. It then calculates the total number of segments if `V` is 1. If `V` is 2, it counts the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed using a bitwise shift to quickly calculate powers of 2, considering the context of the entire number. The output is written to `cifre.out`, and the output file is closed. The solution ensures that once a higher number has been formed, the subsequent digits can use all possible additional numbers, taking into account the constraint of not using new indicators or turning off any lit segments.

The previous solution incorrectly calculated the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed. Each digit should be considered in the context of the entire number, and the count should only increase when a higher number is formed without violating the constraints.

The logic must be fixed to properly iterate over the number and increment the count of greater numbers that can be formed when a higher digit is first encountered, considering all possibilities without leading to a smaller overall number. For each digit, we check if it can be turned into a higher digit by lighting up more segments. If so, we add the possibilities from that digit onwards.

Let's correct the implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Mapping from digit to the number of lit segments
const int segments_count[] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Mapping from digit to the number of digits that can be formed by lighting up additional segments
const int additional_possible_digits[] = {3, 7, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 7, 0, 4};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cifre.in");
    std::ofstream out("cifre.out");

    int V;
    unsigned long long N;

    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    if (V == 1) {
        int total_segments = 0;
        std::string number = std::to_string(N);
        for (char digit : number) {
            total_segments += segments_count[digit - '0'];
        }
        out << total_segments << '\n';
    } else if (V == 2) {
        int last_digit_extra_count = additional_possible_digits[N % 10];
        unsigned long long count = 0, num = N;

        // Check each digit starting from the least significant
        while (num > 0) {
            int digit = num % 10;
            num /= 10;

            // Check if additional segments can form greater digits than the current one
            for (int i = digit + 1; i < 10; ++i) {
                if (segments_count[i] > segments_count[digit]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        count += last_digit_extra_count; // Add the possibilities for the last digit
        out << count << '\n';
    }

    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution reads the value of `V` and the number `N` and then processes the input based on `V`. If `V` is 1, it calculates the total number of segments for the number `N`. If `V` is 2, it iterates through the digits of `N` from the least significant digit and counts how many distinct greater numbers can be formed by lighting up additional segments without using additional indicators or turning off any existing segments. The output is then written to `cifre.out`.

The key change is in the handling of `V == 2`: the program now correctly determines the number of possible greater digits for each digit in `N` and properly accumulates the count. It ensures that once a digit is incremented to form a greater number, it considers all possibilities from that point onwards.

Upon further examination, it seems the previous solution still does not consider the specific context of the problem correctly. When counting the number of distinct numbers greater than `N` that can be formed, it must take into account that a greater number must be created starting from the most significant digit and moving towards the least significant digit. If at any point a greater digit is formed by lighting up additional segments, all subsequent digits can then use all their possible greater forms.

Let's rewrite the solution with a clear algorithm that follows these rules:

1. Iterate over the number `N` from left to right (most significant digit to least significant digit).
2. Upon encountering a digit that can be increased by lighting up more segments, calculate the number of greater numbers that can be formed by considering all combinations of subsequent digits.
3. Ensure we only begin this calculation the first time we find such a digit, as any number formed will already be greater than `N`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Count of segments for each digit indexed by the digit itself.
const int segments_for_digit[] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};
// Number of digits that can be created by lighting additional segments.
const int additional_greater_digits[] = {3, 7, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 7, 0, 4};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cifre.in");
    std::ofstream out("cifre.out");

    int V;
    std::string N;

    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    if (V == 1) {
        int total_segments = 0;
        for (char digit : N) {
            total_segments += segments_for_digit[digit - '0'];
        }
        out << total_segments << '\n';
    } else if (V == 2) {
        long long distinct_numbers = 0;
        bool found_higher = false;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < N.size() && !found_higher; ++i) {
            int digit = N[i] - '0';
            for (int j = digit + 1; j < 10; ++j) {
                if (segments_for_digit[j] > segments_for_digit[digit]) {
                    // If we can create a higher digit, add all possible configurations for the rest of the digits.
                    distinct_numbers += 1LL << (N.size() - i - 1);
                    found_higher = true;
                }
            }
        }

        // If we haven't found a higher digit, it means N is the highest possible number with its segments.
        if (!found_higher) {
            distinct_numbers = 0;
        }

        out << distinct_numbers << '\n';
    }

    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should now properly calculate the number of distinct numbers greater than `N` that can be formed, taking into account the constraints given in the problem statement. The key fix is ensuring that for each digit of `N`, we only consider creating a greater number once and that all subsequent numbers contribute to this count.

Upon further examination, the error in the previous solution arises because it doesn't take into account that after creating a higher digit, all subsequent digits can be any of the digits that can be formed by lighting up additional segments, regardless of their current value. However, it also needs to add only those numbers that are strictly greater than the given number `N`, considering only digits that can be formed by lighting additional segments without turning any off.

To fix this, we need to:

1. For the first non-maximum digit encountered from left to right, count the number of strictly greater digits that can be formed by adding segments.
2. For all subsequent digits, count all the possible digits that can be formed by adding segments (for digits 0-8 since 9 cannot be increased).
3. Ensure that after we have found a digit that can be increased, we treat all subsequent digits as being able to form any greater digit by adding segments.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Count of segments for each digit indexed by the digit itself.
const int segments_for_digit[] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};
// Number of digits that can be generated by lighting up additional segments for each digit.
const int additional_digits_after[] = {0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1}; // After 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

// Function to calculate the number of distinct numbers greater than 'N' by additional segment lighting.
unsigned long long count_greater_numbers(const std::string& N) {
    unsigned long long count = 0;
    bool additional_segment_used = false;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < N.length(); ++i) {
        int digit = N[i] - '0';
        // If we haven't used an additional segment yet, check how many greater digits we can make from this one.
        if (!additional_segment_used) {
            for (int greater_digit = digit + 1; greater_digit <= 9; ++greater_digit) {
                // We can only form a greater digit if it requires more segments than the current one.
                if (segments_for_digit[greater_digit] > segments_for_digit[digit]) {
                    count += 1ULL << (N.length() - i - 1); // Add all combinations from this point onward.
                }
            }
            // If the current digit is not the greatest possible with its number of segments, it means we can use an additional segment here.
            additional_segment_used = segments_for_digit[digit] != 7;
        } else {
            // If we have already used an additional segment, all subsequent digits can be any digit from 0 to 9
            // that can be formed by lighting up additional segments (since we're ensuring the number is greater).
            count += additional_digits_after[digit] * (1ULL << (N.length() - i - 1));
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cifre.in");
    std::ofstream out("cifre.out");

    int V;
    std::string N;

    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    if (V == 1) {
        int total_segments = 0;
        for (char digit : N) {
            total_segments += segments_for_digit[digit - '0'];
        }
        out << total_segments << '\n';
    } else if (V == 2) {
        unsigned long long distinct_numbers = count_greater_numbers(N);
        out << distinct_numbers << '\n';
    }

    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This fix ensures that for each digit in `N`, we are considering all the viable greater digits that can be formed by lighting up additional segments. For subsequent digits after using an additional segment, we consider only those digits that can be formed by lighting up more segments up to 9, as 9 cannot be increased further. This solution should now correctly calculate the number of distinct numbers greater than `N` that can be formed according to the problem's rules.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to the algorithm not correctly handling the cases where lighting up additional segments can form a greater number without changing the currently lit segments. My previous solution over-counted the number of possible greater numbers by incorrectly allowing for any greater digit to follow once a higher digit was found, while it should only account for those greater numbers that can be formed with additional segments.

To fix the solution, we need to carefully consider each digit and how many greater numbers can be formed with additional segments without affecting the existing lit segments. This involves a more detailed per-digit analysis based on the specific segments that could be lit for each digit.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

// Mapping of digits to the number of segments lit.
const int segments_for_digit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Given a digit, list the digits that can be formed by lighting up additional segments.
const std::map<int, std::vector<int>> next_digits = {
    {0, {8}},
    {1, {4, 7, 8, 9}}, // 1 can be turned into 4, 7, 8, 9
    {2, {8}},
    {3, {8, 9}},
    {4, {8, 9}},
    {5, {6, 8, 9}},
    {6, {8}},
    {7, {0, 3, 8, 9}},
    {8, {}}, // 8 cannot be turned into any other digit by lighting up additional segments
    {9, {8}}
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cifre.in");
    std::ofstream out("cifre.out");

    int V;
    std::string N;

    in >> V;
    in >> N;
    in.close();

This algorithm calculates the number of distinct numbers greater than `N` that can be formed by lighting up additional segments without turning off any existing ones. It iterates through each digit of `N` and uses the `next_digits` map to determine which numbers can be formed from the current digit by lighting up additional segments. Once it makes a digit higher, it sets the `made_higher` flag to true and accounts for all possible numbers that can be created for the rest of the digits by adding segments. This solution should now give the correct output for the given problem.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to the incorrect calculation of the number of greater numbers that can be formed by lighting up additional segments. The error occurs because the algorithm does not correctly handle the transition from a digit that cannot be increased to a digit that can be increased. Additionally, it should consider the combinations that can be formed by the remaining digits after the first increase.

The correct approach should be:

1. For each digit in `N`, determine whether it can be turned into a higher digit by lighting up additional segments without extinguishing any that are already lit.
2. When the first such digit is found, calculate the number of greater numbers that can be formed by:
   - Increasing the current digit to all possible higher digits.
   - Considering all permutations of the remaining digits that can be formed by adding segments.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Number of segments for each digit 0-9
const int segments[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Additional numbers that can be formed for each digit by lighting up more segments
const std::vector<int> additional[10] = {
    {8}, // 0 can form 8
    {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}, // 1 can form 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
    {8}, // 2 can form 8
    {8, 9}, // 3 can form 8, 9
    {8, 9}, // 4 can form 8, 9
    {6, 8, 9}, // 5 can form 6, 8, 9
    {8}, // 6 can form 8
    {0, 3, 8, 9}, // 7 can form 0, 3, 8, 9
    {}, // 8 cannot form a higher number
    {8} // 9 can form 8
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cifre.in");
    std::ofstream out("cifre.out");

    int V;
    std::string N;

    in >> V >> N;
    in.close();

    if (V == 1) {
        // Count the total segments used to display the number N.
        int total_segments = 0;
        for (char digit : N) {
            total_segments += segments[digit - '0'];
        }
        out << total_segments << '\n';
    } else if (V == 2) {
        // Count the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed.
        long long distinct_count = 0;
        bool increment_allowed = false;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < N.length(); i++) {
            int digit = N[i] - '0';

            // If we have not yet incremented any digit...
            if (!increment_allowed) {
                // Count the additional greater numbers that can be formed by this digit.
                for (int add_digit : additional[digit]) {
                    if (add_digit > digit) {
                        // Calculate the number of variations for the rest of the digits.
                        distinct_count += 1LL << (N.length() - i - 1);
                    }
                }
                // Check if this digit allows incrementing
                increment_allowed = !additional[digit].empty();
            } else {
                // If we already incremented a digit, all subsequent digits can be incremented to any higher digit.
                // Since 8 uses all segments, it cannot be incremented, so we calculate for 0-7, and 9.
                if (digit != 8) {
                    distinct_count += 1LL << (N.length() - i - 1);
                }
            }
        }

        out << distinct_count << '\n';
    }

    out.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this revised code, we look for the first opportunity to increment a digit by lighting up additional segments. Once we find such an opportunity, we calculate how many greater numbers can be formed by considering the number of variations for the rest of the digits. If the opportunity has already been taken, all subsequent digits (except 8) can be changed to any higher digit by lighting up additional segments. This solution should now produce the expected output for the input provided.
