Un indicator numeric este un dispozitiv de afişaj electronic destinat afişării unei **cifre** zecimale. Acesta conține 7 segmente notate cu `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, ca în figura alăturată.

Afişarea unei cifre se face prin aprinderea unei combinații de segmente:
~[0.png|width=10em|align=right]
- Cifra 0: `a`, `b`, `c` ,`d`,`e`,`f`
- Cifra 1: `b`, `c`
- Cifra 2: `a`, `b`, `d` ,`e`, `g`

- Cifra 9: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `f`, `g`

# Cerință
Cunoscând un număr natural $N$ afișat cu ajutorul mai multor indicatoare numerice, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. Numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.
2. Numărul de numere distincte mai **mari** decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în **plus** față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice și fără a stinge niciun segment dintre cele deja aprinse.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare este `cifre.in`.

Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.

Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire este `cifre.out`.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând numărul de numere distincte mai mari decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în plus, față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice.

# Restricţii şi precizări

The bug in the code is in the calculation of the number of greater numbers that can be formed by lighting up additional segments for each digit. The code is considering each digit independently without considering that lighting up an additional segment on a higher place digit can lead to a much larger number of possibilities due to the combinations with lower place digits. 

In the given example (N=823), by lighting one more segment on the first digit '8', it cannot become any higher digit since '8' uses all segments. However, for the second digit '2', it can become a '3' or an '8'. If it becomes '3', it must be counted as one possibility, and if it becomes '8', we must consider all the possible combinations for the last digit (which is '3'), that can become '8' or '9'. 

The current code does not handle the propagation effect of changing a higher place digit properly. 

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

const std::vector<int> segments = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6}; // Number of segments for 0-9
const std::vector<int> transitions = {0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1}; // Number of higher digits achievable from each digit by adding segments

std::ifstream fin("cifre.in");
std::ofstream fout("cifre.out");

int main() {
    int V;
    fin >> V;
    std::string N;
    fin >> N;
    int segmentCount = 0;
    long long greaterNumbers = 0;

    for (char c : N) {
        int digit = c - '0';
        segmentCount += segments[digit];
    }

    if (V == 1) {
        fout << segmentCount << '\n';
    } else {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < N.size(); ++i) {
            int digit = N[i] - '0';
            // Calculate the number of greater numbers by adding segments to the current digit
            greaterNumbers += transitions[digit] * (1LL << (N.size() - i - 1));
            // If the current digit is 8 or 9, there are no greater numbers that can be formed by adding segments
            if (digit == 8 || digit == 9) {
                break;
            }
        }
        fout << greaterNumbers << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this updated code, the `transitions` array holds the number of greater numbers that can be formed by adding segments to each digit (excluding 8 and 9 as they can't be increased). The calculation of `greaterNumbers` is corrected to account for the possibility of changing a digit to a higher digit by lighting additional segments and multiplying that by the number of possibilities for the remaining digits. However, once we reach a digit that is either 8 or 9, we break the loop because we can't increase those digits any further by adding segments, and hence no greater numbers are possible from that point on.

The previous solution does not consider that we can form new numbers by lighting up segments on lower position digits after changing a higher position digit. For example, when we change the second digit '2' to '3' in '823', we only count it as one new number, but we should also consider that the last digit '3' can be changed to '8' or '9', forming two additional numbers: '838' and '839'.

Let's fix the code to consider all possibilities by properly calculating the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed by lighting up at least one additional segment for each digit in the number.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <array>
#include <string>

// Number of segments for digits 0-9
const std::array<int, 10> segment_counts = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Count of numbers greater than the current digit that can be formed by lighting additional segments
const std::array<int, 10> additional_segments_counts = {1, 7, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 0, 0};

std::ifstream fin("cifre.in");
std::ofstream fout("cifre.out");

int main() {
    int V;
    fin >> V;
    std::string N;
    fin >> N;
    
    int total_segment_count = 0;
    long long greater_numbers_count = 0;

    // Calculate the total number of segments lit for displaying the number N
    for (char digit : N) {
        total_segment_count += segment_counts[digit - '0'];
    }

    // Output the total number of segments lit if V is 1
    if (V == 1) {
        fout << total_segment_count << '\n';
    } else {
        // Calculate the number of greater numbers than N that can be formed
        long long multiplier = 1;
        for (int i = N.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int digit = N[i] - '0';
            greater_numbers_count += additional_segments_counts[digit] * multiplier;
            
            // Update the multiplier for the next higher digit
            // Each higher digit has two more possibilities (8 or 9)
            multiplier *= 2;
        }
        
        fout << greater_numbers_count << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code calculates the number of greater numbers that can be formed by lighting up additional segments. It uses a multiplier that doubles for each higher digit because each digit can potentially turn into an '8' or a '9' if the previous digit is increased, thus providing two additional possibilities. We start from the least significant digit and work our way up to the most significant digit, updating the count of greater numbers and the multiplier accordingly. The `additional_segments_counts` array holds the count of numbers that are greater than the current digit and can be formed by adding more segments.

The previous solutions did not handle the calculation for the number of greater numbers that can be formed correctly. The calculation should consider each digit's possible transitions to a greater number by adding more segments without turning off any current segment.

Let's correct this by first establishing the possible transitions:

- From 0, we can only form 8.
- From 1, we can form 4, 7, 8, 9, or 3.
- From 2, we can form 8.
- From 3, we can form 8 or 9.
- From 4, we can form 8 or 9.
- From 5, we can form 6, 8, or 9.
- From 6, we can form 8.
- From 7, we can form 0, 3, 8, or 9.
- From 8, we cannot form a greater number.
- From 9, we cannot form a greater number.

Given the above transitions, we can calculate the possible numbers for each digit that is not 8 or 9. We also need to take into account that forming a new number with a higher digit will reset all subsequent digits to 8, as once a higher digit is chosen, all combinations possible for the lower digits are available.

Let's correct the solution with these considerations:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

std::ifstream fin("cifre.in");
std::ofstream fout("cifre.out");

// Mapping from each digit to the number of greater numbers that can be displayed by adding segments.
std::unordered_map<char, int> additional_numbers = {
    {'0', 1}, {'1', 6}, {'2', 1}, {'3', 2}, {'4', 2}, 
    {'5', 3}, {'6', 1}, {'7', 4}, {'8', 0}, {'9', 0}
};

int main() {
    int V;
    fin >> V;
    std::string N;
    fin >> N;
    fin.close();
    
    long long total_segments = 0;
    long long greater_numbers = 0;

    // Lookup for number of segments to display each digit.
    std::vector<int> segments{6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

    // Calculate total number of segments for displaying the number N and prepare for greater numbers calculation.
    for (char digit : N) {
        total_segments += segments[digit - '0'];
    }

    // Calculate the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed.
    if (V == 2) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < N.size(); ++i) {
            char digit = N[i];
            // Skip if the current digit is 8 or 9 since we can't get a greater number by adding segments.
            if (digit == '8' || digit == '9') continue;

            // Add the number of greater numbers that can be formed by this digit.
            greater_numbers += additional_numbers[digit];

            // If we can add segments to form a greater number, all subsequent digits can become 8.
            if (additional_numbers[digit] > 0) {
                greater_numbers += (N.size() - i - 1) * (1LL << (N.size() - i - 1));
                break; // Break after considering the first non-8/9 digit from the left.
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the result based on the value of V.
    if (V == 1) {
        fout << total_segments << '\n';
    } else if (V == 2) {
        fout << greater_numbers << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we use an unordered map to store the number of greater numbers that can be formed by adding segments for each digit. We then iterate over each digit of the input number N to calculate the total number of segments and to determine the number of greater numbers that can be formed. If V is 2, we calculate the greater numbers considering the first digit from the left that is not 8 or 9, as we can then turn all following digits into 8. The `break` statement ensures we don't process digits after we've already processed a digit that can form a greater number by adding segments.

The previous solution still contains errors. It does not correctly account for the number of larger numbers that can be formed when there are multiple opportunities to add segments at different positions within the number. For instance, if we add a segment to the second digit of "823" to turn it into an "8," we must consider the different possibilities that arise for the last digit, which can now become "8" or "9," hence adding 2 to the count. The previous solution incorrectly broke the loop after finding the first digit that could form a larger number.

We need to approach the problem by considering each digit's potential to form larger numbers and the impact on all subsequent digits, not just the immediate next digit.

Let's implement a correct solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

const std::vector<int> segmentCounts = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};  // Number of segments for 0-9
// Additional numbers that can be formed by adding segments to a digit, without considering subsequent digits
const std::vector<int> additionalNumbers = {1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0};

std::ifstream fin("cifre.in");
std::ofstream fout("cifre.out");

int main() {
    int V;
    fin >> V;
    std::string N;
    fin >> N;
    fin.close();

    int totalSegmentCount = 0;
    long long greaterNumbers = 0;

    // Calculate the total number of segments lit for displaying the number N
    for (char c : N) {
        totalSegmentCount += segmentCounts[c - '0'];
    }

    if (V == 1) {
        fout << totalSegmentCount << "\n";
    } else {
        // Calculate the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed
        for (size_t position = 0; position < N.size(); ++position) {
            int digit = N[position] - '0';

            // For each digit in N, calculate the number of additional greater numbers that can be made
            if (additionalNumbers[digit] > 0) {
                // For each possible greater number at this position, all subsequent digits can become '8'.
                for (int i = 0; i < additionalNumbers[digit]; ++i) {
                    greaterNumbers += 1LL << (N.size() - position - 1);
                }
            }
        }
        fout << greaterNumbers << "\n";
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over each digit and calculate the number of additional greater numbers at each position. For each possibility at the current position, all subsequent digits have the potential to become '8', effectively doubling the count for each subsequent digit. Therefore, we add `1LL << (N.size() - position - 1)` to `greaterNumbers` for each greater number possible at the current digit position. This accounts for all combinations of subsequent digits turning into '8'.

The previous implementation does not account for the fact that after transforming one digit to a greater valid number by adding segments, the rest of the digits to the right can also be transformed into either an '8' or a '9' if they are not initially an '8' or a '9'. This multiplies the possibilities for each valid transformation of a digit.

We need to fix this by taking into account the transformation of each digit and then multiplying the possibilities based on how many digits to the right can be changed.

Let's rewrite the solution with these corrections:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Segments lit for digits 0-9
const std::vector<int> segments = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};
// Possibilities for making a larger number by lighting up more segments for each digit
const std::vector<int> possibilities = {0, 6, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2, 4, 0, 0};

std::ifstream fin("cifre.in");
std::ofstream fout("cifre.out");

int main() {
    int V;
    fin >> V;
    std::string N;
    fin >> N;
    fin.close();

    int totalSegmentCount = 0;
    long long greaterNumbers = 0;

    // Calculate the total number of segments lit for the number N
    for (char c : N) {
        totalSegmentCount += segments[c - '0'];
    }

    // If V is 1, output the total segment count
    if (V == 1) {
        fout << totalSegmentCount << "\n";
    } else {
        int length = N.size();
        // Iterate through each digit in N
        for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            int digit = N[i] - '0';
            // Calculate the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed from this digit
            greaterNumbers += possibilities[digit];

            // For every digit that can be incremented by lighting up more segments:
            if (possibilities[digit] > 0) {
                // Calculate the additional combinations when the subsequent digits are transformed into '8' or '9'
                for (int j = i + 1; j < length; ++j) {
                    int nextDigit = N[j] - '0';
                    // If the next digit is not '8' or '9', it can be turned into '8' or '9'
                    if (nextDigit != 8 && nextDigit != 9) {
                        greaterNumbers += (2 * (1LL << (length - j - 1))); // Multiply by two for '8' and '9'
                    }
                }
                break; // Stop after the first incrementable digit as all subsequent digits will reset to '8'
            }
        }
        fout << greaterNumbers << "\n";
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The main difference in this solution is that after incrementing a digit by lighting more segments, we now properly count the additional combinations that can be formed by transforming subsequent digits into '8' or '9' (if they are not already '8' or '9'). We then break out of the loop because any further changes to the right will only reset digits to '8', and we have already accounted for all the possibilities. This fix should now correctly output the expected number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed.

The code provided in the previous answer still does not produce the correct output because it incorrectly calculates the number of greater numbers that can be made by adding segments to each digit. It does not correctly account for the fact that, after transforming a digit to a greater number, the rest of the digits to the right can become either '8' or '9', which depends on their current state, not just any state.

Let's implement the correct logic:

1. For each digit in the number, we will determine which greater digits it can become by adding segments.
2. We need to keep track of the count of such transformations that result in greater numbers.
3. We need to consider that, once we change a current digit, all subsequent digits (to the right) that are not '8' or '9' already can also be changed to '8' or '9', increasing the count of possibilities.

Here's the correct implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Reading and writing files without including the entire <iostream> header.
std::ifstream fin("cifre.in");
std::ofstream fout("cifre.out");

// Segments required to display digits 0 to 9.
const std::vector<int> segments = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Digits that can be obtained by adding segments to the current digit (not including 8 and 9).
const std::vector<std::vector<int>> nextDigits = {
    {8},        // From 0
    {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}, // From 1
    {8},        // From 2
    {8, 9},     // From 3
    {8, 9},     // From 4
    {6, 8, 9},  // From 5
    {8},        // From 6
    {0, 3, 8, 9},  // From 7
    {},          // From 8
    {}           // From 9
};

int main() {
    int V;
    fin >> V;
    std::string N;
    fin >> N;

    int segmentCount = 0;
    long long greaterNumbersCount = 0;
    
    // Calculate the segment count for the number N.
    for (char c : N) {
        segmentCount += segments[c - '0'];
    }
    
    if (V == 1) {
        fout << segmentCount << '\n';
    } else {
        // Calculate the number of greater numbers that can be formed.
        for (size_t i = 0; i < N.size(); ++i) {
            int digit = N[i] - '0';
            // For each digit, determine which greater numbers can be formed.
            for (int nextDigit : nextDigits[digit]) {
                // Check if the transformation leads to a greater number.
                if (nextDigit > digit) {
                    // If so, calculate the number of variations for the subsequent digits.
                    // Each non-8/9 digit can be turned into two possibilities: 8 or 9.
                    int variations = 1;
                    for (size_t j = i + 1; j < N.size(); ++j) {
                        if (N[j] != '8' && N[j] != '9') {
                            variations *= 2;
                        }
                    }
                    greaterNumbersCount += variations;
                }
            }
        }
        fout << greaterNumbersCount << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we define `nextDigits` to specify which digits can be obtained from each digit by adding segments. We then iterate through each digit in the given number, and for each possible greater digit, we calculate the variations by considering all subsequent digits and checking how many of them can be turned into '8' or '9'. Finally, we output the count of these greater numbers to `cifre.out`. This should provide the correct result.
