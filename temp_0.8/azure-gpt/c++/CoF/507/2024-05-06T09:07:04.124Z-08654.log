Mihai s-a decis în sfârșit să compună o melodie. Fără să știe de unde să înceapă, a scris pe o foaie $n$ note muzicale. Fiecare notă muzicală este definită de două valori reprezentând durata și înălțimea acesteia astfel:
* **durata** este exprimată printr-o fracție de forma $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2^x}$, unde $x$ este un număr natural nenul;
* **înălțimea** este exprimată printr-un număr natural nenul $y$.

Durata unui grup de note este egală cu suma duratelor notelor din grup. Pentru a compune o melodie corect din punct de vedere muzical, el trebuie să distribuie toate notele în grupuri disjuncte, astfel încât durata fiecărui grup să fie $1$. Mihai definește **scorul unui grup** de note ca fiind suma înălțimilor tuturor notelor din grup, ridicată la pătrat. De asemenea, el definește **scorul unei melodii** ca fiind suma scorurilor tuturor grupurilor de note formate
care pot forma un grup.

Mihai vrea să afle care este scorul maxim al unei melodii pe care îl poate obține după gruparea tuturor notelor date.

# Cerință

Dându-se $n$ note sub forma a $n$ perechi de numere, $x$ și $y$, să se afișeze scorul maxim ce poate fi obținut după gruparea tuturor notelor date în grupuri disjuncte.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `partitura.in` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de note, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț, pentru fiecare din cele $n$ note.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `partitura.out` va conține un singur număr natural reprezentând scorul maxim cerut.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 300 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq x \leq 18$;
* $1 \leq y \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că se pot distribui toate notele date în grupuri de durată $1$.
* Pentru $20$ de puncte, $n \leq 4$, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $22$ de puncte, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, pentru toate notele, $x$ are aceeași valoare;
* Pentru $41$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

This C++ program reads from "partitura.in" and writes to "partitura.out". It calculates the maximum score according to the problem statement. It sorts the notes based on their duration, then combines them while keeping track of their cumulative height until the total duration reaches 1. It then calculates the score by squaring the sum of the heights in each group and summing these scores. The program avoids using cin/cout for IO as specified.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, we can see that the output of the provided code is `0` instead of the expected `169`. This indicates that the algorithm designed to calculate the maximum score of the melody is incorrect. The original code tried to use a greedy approach by sorting and combining heights, but this approach doesn't consider the optimal grouping necessary to achieve the maximum score.

To fix this, we need to implement a new algorithm that takes into account all possible groupings of notes that sum up to a duration of 1. We know that the duration is a fraction of the form $\frac{1}{2^x}$, so we will use an array of vectors to keep track of the sum of heights for each possible group duration that is a power of 2 up to $2^{18}$. We then use this information to combine these groups into full durations (of 1) while maximizing the score.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate the score by squaring the sum of the heights.
long long calculate_score(const vector<long long>& heights) {
    long long score = 0;
    for (long long height : heights) {
        score += height * height;
    }
    return score;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("partitura.in");
    ofstream fout("partitura.out");

    int n, x;
    long long y;
    fin >> n;

    // Create a vector to store the sum of heights for each power of 2 duration.
    vector<long long> duration_sums(1 << 18);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> x >> y;
        // The duration is stored as an index in the vector.
        int duration_index = (1 << (18 - x));
        duration_sums[duration_index] += y;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Combine smaller durations to form a full duration (of 1), maximizing the score.
    for (int i = (1 << 18) - 1; i > 0; --i) {
        if (duration_sums[i] == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        for (int j = i; j; j = (j - 1) & i) {
            duration_sums[i - j] = max(duration_sums[i - j], duration_sums[i] + duration_sums[j]);
        }
    }

    // Calculate the final score.
    long long score = calculate_score(duration_sums);

    fout << score << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the best way to combine notes into groups with a duration of 1 while maximizing the score. It iterates through all possible combinations of durations that sum up to less than or equal to 1 and updates the sum of the heights accordingly. The `calculate_score` function computes the final score by squaring each group's height sum. The program still avoids using slow IO operations and works with the constraints given.

---------- assistant ----------

The found output of `281` differs from the expected `169` because the approach I previously described does not correctly group the notes to maximize the score. The algorithm should consider all possible combinations that sum up durations to 1, and it should aim to maximize the sum of the heights in each group before squaring them to compute the score.

To solve the challenge correctly, we need to implement a backtracking or dynamic programming algorithm that respects the constraints. However, given the high number of notes (up to 300,000), a full backtracking solution would be too slow, so we need to use a more optimal approach.

One such approach is to use a bitmask dynamic programming technique. The idea is to represent the combination of notes as a bitmask, where each bit represents whether a note of a certain duration is used or not. We will track the best score possible for each combination of durations that sum up to 1, and then pick the maximum score among them.

Here is the re-implemented solution using a bitmask dynamic programming approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_DURATION_LOG = 18; // Maximum power of 2 for the duration.

long long dp[1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG]; // Dynamic programming table to store the best score for each bitmask.

// Function to calculate the score of the current combination of notes.
long long calculate_score(const vector<long long>& group_heights) {
    long long score = 0;
    for (long long height : group_heights) {
        score += height * height;
    }
    return score;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("partitura.in");
    ofstream fout("partitura.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    vector<long long> heights(1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        long long y;
        fin >> x >> y;
        heights[1 << (x - 1)] += y;
    }
    fin.close();

    int full_duration_mask = (1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG) - 1;
    fill(dp, dp + (1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG), -1); // Initialize the DP table with -1.
    dp[0] = 0; // Base case: no notes have a score of 0.

    // Iterate over all possible combinations of notes.
    for (int mask = 0; mask <= full_duration_mask; mask++) {
        if (dp[mask] == -1) continue; // Skip if this combination is not possible.

        // Try to add each note to the current combination.
        for (int note_duration_log = 0; note_duration_log < MAX_DURATION_LOG; note_duration_log++) {
            int note_mask = 1 << note_duration_log;
            if (mask & note_mask) continue; // Skip if the note is already used in the combination.

            int new_mask = mask | note_mask;
            if (new_mask <= full_duration_mask) { // Check if the new combination is valid.
                dp[new_mask] = max(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + heights[note_mask]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the final score.
    long long score = calculate_score(dp);

    fout << score << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this revised solution, `dp[mask]` stores the maximum sum of heights that can be accumulated by a combination of notes represented by `mask`. We iterate over all possible combinations of notes and try to add each note to the current combination, updating the dynamic programming table with the best sum of heights. The final score is then calculated by iterating over all entries in the DP table and finding the maximum score. This approach should produce the correct maximum score for the given input data.

---------- assistant ----------

The error message indicates that we are trying to pass an array of `long long int` to the `calculate_score` function, which expects a constant reference to a `vector<long long int>`. This is due to the function being defined to take a vector, but we are attempting to pass an array `dp` to it.

We can fix this issue by changing the `calculate_score` function to accept an array instead of a vector. I'll rewrite the `calculate_score` function and the `main` function accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_DURATION_LOG = 18; // Maximum power of 2 for the duration.

long long dp[1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG]; // Dynamic programming table to store the best score for each bitmask.

// Function to calculate the score of the current combination of notes.
long long calculate_score(long long dp[], int size) {
    long long score = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (dp[i] >= 0) { // Ensure we only calculate score for valid combinations
            score = max(score, dp[i] * dp[i]);
        }
    }
    return score;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("partitura.in");
    ofstream fout("partitura.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    vector<long long> heights(1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG, 0);

    // Read the notes and store their heights.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        long long y;
        fin >> x >> y;
        heights[1 << (x - 1)] += y;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Initialize the DP table to represent no combinations.
    fill(dp, dp + (1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG), -1);
    dp[0] = 0; // Base case: no notes means a sum of heights of 0.

    // Dynamic programming to find the best combination of notes.
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG); ++mask) {
        if (dp[mask] < 0) continue; // Skip if this combination is not valid.

        for (int note = 0; note < MAX_DURATION_LOG; ++note) {
            int note_mask = 1 << note;
            if (mask & note_mask) continue; // Skip if the note is already in the combination.

            int new_mask = mask | note_mask;
            if (new_mask < (1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG)) {
                dp[new_mask] = max(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + heights[note_mask]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the final maximum score.
    long long score = calculate_score(dp, 1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG);

    fout << score << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Now the `calculate_score` function accepts an array and its size, correctly calculates the maximum score using the dynamic programming table `dp`, and then we call this function with the correct parameters.

The result differs because the code incorrectly calculates the maximum score by simply taking the maximum height sum of any valid combination and squaring it. The issue lies in not considering how to optimally group the notes into exact durations of 1 while maximizing the combined heights of each group before squaring. A correct solution requires combining smaller durations into larger ones, up to the point where they form a complete duration, ensuring the sum of heights for each group is maximized.

To fix this, we should use a more refined dynamic programming approach where we keep track of the best way to fill each possible duration with notes, ensuring that we can create complete groups with a duration of 1. For this, we track the sum of heights and the sum of squared heights separately, combining them only when we reach a full group.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_DURATION_LOG = 18; // Up to 2^18 duration fractions
long long dp[1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG]; // Stores the best height sum for each duration combination

int main() {
    ifstream fin("partitura.in");
    ofstream fout("partitura.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize DP table with zeros

    // Read in the notes and populate the dp table with the heights
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x;
        long long y;
        fin >> x >> y;
        dp[1 << (x-1)] += y;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Main DP loop to fill in all possible duration combinations
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG); mask++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < MAX_DURATION_LOG; j++) {
            if (mask & (1 << j)) {
                dp[mask] = max(dp[mask], dp[mask ^ (1 << j)] + dp[1 << j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the score for the complete duration
    long long score = dp[(1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG) - 1];
    score *= score; // Square the height sum of the complete group

    fout << score << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, `dp[mask]` now represents the best height sum we can achieve for the duration represented by `mask`. We iterate over all subsets of the mask to find the best way to add a note to our current combination. After processing all combinations, `dp[(1 << MAX_DURATION_LOG) - 1]` contains the best height sum for a full duration (of 1). We then square this sum to get the final score, which is written to "partitura.out". This should now give the correct maximum score for any given input within the problem's constraints.

The error in the previous code was that it didn't track groups of notes properly. Instead of just trying to maximize the height sum for the full duration (mask corresponding to 1), we need to consider how to form groups of exactly 1 duration. Since we can have multiple such groups, we need to find the best way to distribute the heights among these groups to maximize the overall score, which is the sum of the squares of the heights of each group.

To fix this, we need to implement a solution that focuses on forming groups of duration 1 and calculating the score for each group. The optimal approach involves using a priority queue to store the sum of heights for each group and combining groups to form a full duration group, maximally utilizing the available notes.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("partitura.in");
    ofstream fout("partitura.out");

    int n, x;
    long long y;
    fin >> n;

    // Use a priority queue to store the heights, maximizing the front element.
    priority_queue<long long> pq;

    // Read the notes and add them to the priority queue.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> x >> y;
        pq.push(y);
        if (x > 1) {
            // If duration is less than 1, combine this note with another one of the same duration.
            for (int j = 0; j < (1 << (x - 2)); ++j) {
                y = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                y += pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                pq.push(y);
            }
        }
    }
    fin.close();

    // Calculate the score by summing the squares of the height of each group.
    long long score = 0;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        y = pq.top(); pq.pop();
        score += y * y;
    }

    fout << score << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we manage the grouping using a max heap (priority queue). We continuously combine pairs of notes with the same duration (which is less than 1) to form larger groups, always prioritizing the combination of the largest available heights because we want to maximize the sum of the squares. When the duration is already 1, we directly push the height onto the priority queue. Finally, we calculate the score by summing the squares of each height in the priority queue. This should give us the expected maximum score for the given input.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was forcibly terminated, often by the operating system. This can happen due to the program using too much memory, taking too much time, or reaching a system-defined limit on resources. Since there is no output in either stdout or stderr, one common reason could be that the program ran out of memory, which is quite possible given the large potential size of inputs.

The code using a priority queue might not be the most memory-efficient approach, as it holds all note heights, and for $n$ up to 300,000, this could lead to memory issues. Additionally, the algorithm can also be inefficient in time complexity if many notes have a duration less than 1, leading to many iterations.

To fix this, we need an algorithm that efficiently aggregates notes of the same duration. Since the durations are in the form of $1/2^x$, we can use an array to keep track of the total height for each possible duration, and then combine these efficiently, always pairing up notes of the same duration until we reach a full duration.

Here's a revised solution that should be more memory and time-efficient:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Helper function to calculate score
long long calculateScore(const vector<long long>& groupSums) {
    long long score = 0;
    for (auto sum : groupSums) {
        score += sum * sum;
    }
    return score;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("partitura.in");
    ofstream fout("partitura.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    // We have at most 2^18 possible durations, initialize to 0
    vector<long long> heightSums(1 << 18, 0);

    // Read notes and aggregate heights by duration
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        long long y;
        fin >> x >> y;
        heightSums[x - 1] += y; // Aggregate sum of heights for each duration
    }
    fin.close();

    // Combine notes to form groups of duration 1, starting from the smallest duration
    for (int i = 0; i < 18; ++i) {
        while (heightSums[i] > 0) {
            // Find the note with the nearest duration to combine with
            int j = i;
            while (j < 18 && heightSums[j] == 0) {
                ++j;
            }
            if (j < 18) {
                heightSums[i] -= (1LL << (j - i)); // Combine notes
                heightSums[j]--; // Reduce the count for the combined note
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the final score
    long long score = calculateScore(heightSums);

    fout << score << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we use an array `heightSums` to store the sum of heights for each duration in the form of $1/2^x$. We then combine these sums in pairs, always combining with the closest larger duration sum, until we have sums corresponding to a full duration of 1. Finally, we calculate the total score by summing up the squares of the sums of heights. This should produce a correct output without running out of memory or taking too much time.
