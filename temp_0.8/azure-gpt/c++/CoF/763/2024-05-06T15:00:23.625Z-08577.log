Pe o tablă de șah cu $n$ linii și $n$ coloane se află firimituri de pâine și o furnică. Pentru fiecare pătrățel, inclusiv cel în care se găsește furnica, aflat pe linia $i$ și coloana $j$, cantitatea de firimituri de pâine este egală cu restul împărțirii lui $i + j$ la $6$. Astfel pentru $n = 4$ tabla de șah conține următoarele cantități de firimituri:

|2|3|4|5|
-|-|-|-
|**3**|**4**|**5**|**0**|
|**4**|**5**|**0**|**1**|
|**5**|**0**|**1**|**2**|

Furnica (notată cu `F` în figura de mai jos) se poate deplasa din pătrățelul unde se găsește în toate cele opt pătrățele vecine, numerotate ca mai jos:

|8|1|2|
-|-|-
|**7**|**F**|**3**|
|**6**|**5**|**4**|

Furnica se deplasează, pornind din pătrățica aflată în colțul din stânga sus, în una dintre pătrățelele vecine, și așa mai departe. Pe drumul său furnica se hrănește cu toată cantitatea de firimituri din pătrățelele prin care a trecut (după ce iese din pătrățică catitatea de firimituri devine $0$). Drumul furnicii este dat printr-un șir de $k$ numere naturale (cuprinse între $1$ și $8$) care precizează, la fiecare pas, următorul pătrățel din drum.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru un drum dat determină cantitatea totală de firimituri mâncată de furnică, precum și numărul pătrățelelor prin care aceasta a trecut de cele mai multe ori.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `furnica.in` conține pe prima linie numerele $n$ și $k$, separate între ele printr-un spațiu, iar pe linia următoare $k$ numere naturale ($1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$ sau $8$) separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând următorul pătrățel din drum pentru un pătrățel curent.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `furnica.out` va conține, pe prima linie, cantitatea totală și numărul pătrățelelor din cerință separate printr-un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 101$;
* $0 < k < 201$;
* Drumul furnicii nu iese din tablou.

Exit code 139 typically indicates a segmentation fault, which is usually caused by accessing memory that the program is not allowed to access, such as indexing an array out of bounds. In our code, when the ant moves, we need to check whether the new position is within the bounds of the board. My initial solution did not include these checks which could lead to the ant moving outside the board and accessing invalid memory.

Let's fix this by adding bounds checks:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("furnica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("furnica.out");
    
    // Direction vectors for the movement of the ant
    const int dx[] = {0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0};
    const int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1};
    
    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;
    
    std::vector<int> moves(k);
    for (int &move : moves) fin >> move;
    
    int crumbs = 0;
    int x = 0, y = 0; // Starting position
    int max_visits = 0;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> board(n, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> visits(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            board[i][j] = (i + j) % 6;
            
    // Process moves
    for (int move : moves) {
        int new_x = x + dx[move];
        int new_y = y + dy[move];
        
        // Boundary check
        if (new_x < 0 || new_x >= n || new_y < 0 || new_y >= n) continue;
        
        // Move the ant
        x = new_x;
        y = new_y;
        
        // Eat the crumbs and mark the visit
        crumbs += board[x][y];
        board[x][y] = 0;
        visits[x][y]++;
        
        // Update the maximum number of visits
        if (visits[x][y] > max_visits) {
            max_visits = visits[x][y];
        }
    }
    
    // Eat the crumbs at the last position
    crumbs += board[x][y];
    visits[x][y]++;
    if (visits[x][y] > max_visits) {
        max_visits = visits[x][y];
    }
    
    // Count the cells with the maximum number of visits
    int count_max_visits = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            if (visits[i][j] == max_visits)
                count_max_visits++;
    
    // Write the output
    fout << crumbs << ' ' << count_max_visits << '\n';
    
    // Close the files
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

I added a boundary check after computing the new position of the ant. If the ant is about to move to a position that is outside the board, the code will skip the move and continue to the next one. This should prevent the segmentation fault by ensuring that the ant only moves within the limits of the board.

Upon reevaluating the mismatch between the expected and found results, it's apparent that the logic within the for loop, which processes the moves, is flawed. The last position of the ant after all movements should be included in the total crumbs calculation.

The error in the code occurs because the last position of the ant is not being considered when counting the crumbs and visits. The ant eats crumbs at the last position and increments the visit count after all moves have been made, which is not reflected throughout the loop.

Here is the corrected solution, which properly accumulates the crumbs and visit counts as the ant moves:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("furnica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("furnica.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> moves(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> moves[i];
    }

    // Close the input file as we no longer need it
    fin.close();

    // Direction vectors for the ant's movement
    const int dx[] = {0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0};
    const int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1};

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> crumbs(n, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> visit_count(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));

    // Initialize the board with crumbs and calculate the initial crumbs
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            crumbs[i][j] = (i + j) % 6;
        }
    }

    int total_crumbs = 0;
    int max_visits = 0;
    int x = 0, y = 0; // Starting position

    // Simulate the ant's movement and eating process
    for (int move : moves) {
        // Update the ant's position
        x += dx[move];
        y += dy[move];

        // Eat the crumbs at the new position
        total_crumbs += crumbs[x][y];
        crumbs[x][y] = 0;

        // Increment the visit count for the current cell
        visit_count[x][y]++;
        if (visit_count[x][y] > max_visits) {
            max_visits = visit_count[x][y];
        }
    }

    // Count the number of cells with max visits
    int max_visit_cells = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (visit_count[i][j] == max_visits) {
                max_visit_cells++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the output to the file
    fout << total_crumbs << ' ' << max_visit_cells << '\n';

    // Close the output file
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This version includes all necessary fixes. It initializes the crumbs on the board correctly, simulates the ant's movements while eating crumbs and counting visits, and correctly identifies the number of cells with the maximum number of visits at the end. The input and output operations are streamlined to use file streams without the need for `cin` or `cout`. The code handles boundary checks implicitly by constraining the ant's movement to the predefined set of moves and assuming that the given moves will never take the ant out of the board (as per the problem constraints).

The exit code 139 indicates a segmentation fault again, which means the program is trying to access memory that it shouldn't. This often happens when working with arrays or vectors if you try to access an element outside of their bounds.

The issue in the previous submission is that I removed the boundary check, which ensures that the ant doesn't go out of bounds. This is a critical step, as the input file might contain moves that could potentially take the ant off the board, leading to undefined behavior and a segmentation fault.

Below is the corrected solution with the boundary checks reintroduced:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("furnica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("furnica.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> moves(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> moves[i];
    }

    // Direction vectors for the ant's movement
    const int dx[] = {0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0};
    const int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1};

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> crumbs(n, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> visit_count(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));

    // Initialize the board with crumbs
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            crumbs[i][j] = (i + j) % 6;
        }
    }

    int total_crumbs = 0;
    int max_visits = 0;
    int x = 0, y = 0; // Starting position

    // Simulate the ant's movement and eating process
    for (int move : moves) {
        // Calculate the new position
        int new_x = x + dx[move];
        int new_y = y + dy[move];

        // Boundary check
        if (new_x >= 0 && new_x < n && new_y >= 0 && new_y < n) {
            // Update the ant's position
            x = new_x;
            y = new_y;

            // Eat the crumbs at the new position
            total_crumbs += crumbs[x][y];
            crumbs[x][y] = 0;

            // Increment the visit count for the current cell
            visit_count[x][y]++;
            if (visit_count[x][y] > max_visits) {
                max_visits = visit_count[x][y];
            }
        }
    }

    // Count the number of cells with max visits
    int max_visit_cells = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (visit_count[i][j] == max_visits) {
                max_visit_cells++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the output to the file
    fout << total_crumbs << ' ' << max_visit_cells << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This version of the solution includes boundary checks before updating the ant's position. These checks prevent the ant from going outside the board's boundaries, which should eliminate the segmentation fault and produce the correct output.

After reviewing the problem, it's clear that my previous solution still does not address all the requirements correctly. The main mistake is that I'm incorrectly performing boundary checks and updating the ant's position within the same move, which could result in disregarding valid moves. This mistake leads to an incorrect accumulation of crumbs and an incorrect count of the most visited cells. I also failed to eat crumbs at the starting position before processing the movements.

Here is the revised, corrected solution, which accounts for the starting position's crumbs, processes each move while including proper boundary checks, and counts the most visited cells accurately:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("furnica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("furnica.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> moves(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> moves[i];
    }
    
    // Close the input file as we no longer need it
    fin.close();

    // Direction vectors for the ant's movement
    const int dx[] = {-1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1};
    const int dy[] = {0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1};

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> visit_count(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
    int total_crumbs = 0;
    int max_visits = 0;
    int x = 0, y = 0; // Starting position

    // Eat the crumbs at the starting position and increment the visit
    total_crumbs += (x + y) % 6;
    visit_count[x][y]++;
    max_visits = 1; // Starting cell is visited once

    // Simulate the ant's movement and eating process
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int dir = moves[i] - 1; // Convert move to 0-based index for dx and dy
        int new_x = x + dx[dir];
        int new_y = y + dy[dir];

        // Boundary check
        if (new_x >= 0 && new_x < n && new_y >= 0 && new_y < n) {
            // Update the ant's position
            x = new_x;
            y = new_y;

            // Eat the crumbs at the new position
            total_crumbs += (x + y) % 6;

            // Increment the visit count for the current cell
            visit_count[x][y]++;
            if (visit_count[x][y] > max_visits) {
                max_visits = visit_count[x][y];
            }
        }
    }

    // Count the number of cells with max visits
    int max_visit_cells = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (visit_count[i][j] == max_visits) {
                max_visit_cells++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the output to the file
    fout << total_crumbs << ' ' << max_visit_cells << '\n';

    // Close the output file
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, I made sure to:

1. Eat the crumbs at the starting position before the ant starts moving.
2. Use the correct 0-based indexing for the `moves` and `dx`, `dy` arrays.
3. Perform boundary checks before updating the ant's position.
4. Count the maximum number of visits correctly.
5. Write the total crumbs eaten and the number of cells with the maximum visits to the output file.

This solution should match the expected output given the input data provided in the challenge.

Looking at the discrepancy between the expected and found results, it seems that there's an issue with the way the crumbs are being counted and how the most visited cells are being tracked.

The total crumbs should be accumulated as the ant moves across the board, and the count of the most visited cells should reflect how often each cell is visited. The previous implementation didn't correctly accumulate the total crumbs eaten by the ant because the calculation was not considering that the crumbs are reset to 0 after the ant visits a cell. Additionally, the calculation for the most visited cells seems to be incorrect.

Let's correct these issues and re-implement the solution as follows:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("furnica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("furnica.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> moves(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> moves[i];
    }
    fin.close(); // Close the input file, we're done with it.

    // Initialize variables
    int x = 0, y = 0; // Starting position of the ant
    int total_crumbs = 0; // Total amount of crumbs eaten by the ant
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> visits(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0)); // Visits count

    // Define the direction vectors for the ant's movement
    int dx[] = {-1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0};
    int dy[] = {0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1};

    // Process each move
    for (int move : moves) {
        // Calculate the position of the next cell based on the move
        int nx = x + dx[move - 1];
        int ny = y + dy[move - 1];

        // Ensure the ant stays within the bounds of the board
        if (nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {

                max_visit_cells++;

    // Write the output

    fout.close(); // Close the output file, we're done with it.

    return 0;
}
```

This solution performs the following:

1. Correctly accumulates the total crumbs eaten as the ant moves across the board.
2. Correctly identifies the maximum number of visits to any cell and the number of cells visited that many times.
3. Ensures that the ant stays within the bounds of the board and does not move to an invalid cell.

With these corrections, the program should now provide the expected output for the given input.

Let's analyze why the output is incorrect. The found output indicates that the total crumbs are not being accumulated correctly. It looks like the ant only gets to eat once, rather than eating at each cell it visits. Moreover, the crumbs are not being reset to 0 after the ant eats them, and we also need to account for crumbs at the starting position before the ant makes any moves.

We need to fix the code by correctly accounting for the crumbs at each cell the ant visits and ensure that we reset the crumbs to 0 after the ant eats them. Additionally, we need to start the crumbs count including the starting cell.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("furnica.in");
    std::ofstream fout("furnica.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> moves(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> moves[i];
    }

    fin.close(); // Done with the input file

    // Define the direction vectors for the ant's movement
    // (Note: indexing changed from 1-based to 0-based, so subtract 1 from moves)
    const int dx[8] = {-1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1};
    const int dy[8] = {0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1};

    // Initialize the board with the number of crumbs (i+j)%6
    std::vector<int> crumbs_count(n * n, 0);
    std::vector<int> visit_count(n * n, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            crumbs_count[i * n + j] = (i + j) % 6;
        }
    }

    int x = 0, y = 0; // Starting position
    int total_crumbs = crumbs_count[0]; // Eat crumbs at the starting cell
    crumbs_count[0] = 0; // Reset the crumbs at the starting cell
    visit_count[0] = 1; // Visit the starting cell

    for (int move : moves) {
        int new_x = x + dx[move - 1];
        int new_y = y + dy[move - 1];
        
        // Check boundaries
        if (new_x >= 0 && new_x < n && new_y >= 0 && new_y < n) {
            x = new_x;
            y = new_y;
            
            // Eat crumbs and mark the visit
            int pos = x * n + y;
            total_crumbs += crumbs_count[pos];
            crumbs_count[pos] = 0; // Reset the crumbs after eating
            visit_count[pos]++;
        }
    }

    // Find the max visits and how many cells have been visited that many times
    int max_visits = *std::max_element(visit_count.begin(), visit_count.end());
    int max_visit_cells = std::count(visit_count.begin(), visit_count.end(), max_visits);

    fout << total_crumbs << ' ' << max_visit_cells << '\n';
    fout.close(); // Done with the output file

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, I:

1. Initialized the board with the correct number of crumbs for each cell.
2. Ate the crumbs at the starting cell before the ant starts moving and reset the starting cell's crumbs to 0.
3. Made sure to eat the crumbs and reset them to 0 after the ant visits a new cell.
4. Used the `std::max_element` and `std::count` algorithms to find the max visits and the number of cells with max visits.

This code should now correctly track the total crumbs eaten and count the most visited cells according to the problem statement and give the expected output.
