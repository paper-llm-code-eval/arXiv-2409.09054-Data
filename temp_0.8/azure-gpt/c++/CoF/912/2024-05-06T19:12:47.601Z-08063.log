Gigel, pasionat de numere, știe că orice număr natural se scrie într-o bază de numerație $b$ ca o succesiune de simboluri care au asociate valori de la $0$ la $b - 1$. De exemplu numărul $7$, scris în baza $10$, se scrie în baza $2$ ca $111 \ (2)$, iar numărul $26732$, scris în baza $10$, se scrie în baza $37$ ca o succesiune de $3$ simboluri, primele două având asociată valoarea $19$, iar ultimul având asociată valoarea $18$. El a descoperit că există numere care au proprietatea că se scriu, în **exact două** baze diferite, prin exact trei simboluri identice. De exemplu, numărul $931 \ (10)$ se scrie în baza $11$ ca $777 \ (11)$, iar în baza $30$ se scrie $111 \ (30)$.

# Cerință

Fiind dat un număr natural $N$, să se determine cel mai mare număr natural mai mic sau egal cu $N$, care are proprietatea că se scrie în exact două baze diferite prin exact $3$ simboluri identice.
1. Să se scrie numărul determinat
2. Să se scrie cele două baze determinate și valorile simbolurilor respective.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `cate3cifre.in` conţine pe prima linie cerința ($1$ sau $2$). Pe linia a doua a fișierului de intrare se află numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `cate3cifre.out` va conține pe prima linie, dacă cerința este $1$, numărul determinat. Dacă cerința este $2$, prima și cea de a doua linie a fișierului de ieșire au aceeași structură: pe fiecare linie se vor scrie, separate printr-un spațiu, două numere naturale $b \ c$, reprezentând baza și valoarea simbolului cerut din baza respectivă. Cele două baze se vor afișa în ordine crescătoare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < N \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $60$ de puncte. Pentru cerința $2$, se acordă $30$ de puncte.
* Pentru $50$ de puncte $N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Se dau $10$ puncte din oficiu (teste corespunzatoare acestor puncte vor coincide cu primul exemplu)
* Numărul $xyz \ (b)$ scris în baza $b$ cu simbolurile $x, y, z$ se scrie în baza $10$ ca o valoare calculată astfel: $x \cdot b^2 + y \cdot b + z$ (unde simbolurile $x, y, z$ se înlocuiesc cu valorile asociate)
* Pentru fiecare test există soluție.

This C++ program addresses the given problem statement by reading the input from `cate3cifre.in` and writing the output to `cate3cifre.out`. It solves both task 1 and task 2 efficiently by checking each number starting from `N` down to `100` and each base from `4` to `99`. It ensures the proper constraints and conditions are satisfied for a number to be represented with three identical symbols in exactly two different bases. The code is optimized for speed and correctness, and it avoids using slow I/O functions like `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, and `scanf()`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output arises because the program is not correctly filtering out numbers that can be represented with three identical digits in more than two bases. The condition `if (n / b / b == n / b % b && n / b % b == n % b)` does not ensure that the number `n` is represented with three identical symbols in exactly two bases—it only checks whether `n` can be represented with three identical symbols in any base `b`. To correct this, we need to track the count of bases in which `n` can be represented with three identical symbols and only consider numbers that meet the criteria for exactly two bases.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to check the number of bases in which the number n 
// can be represented with three identical symbols
int countBases(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int b = 2; b <= n; ++b) {
        if (n / b / b == n / b % b && n / b % b == n % b) {
            count++;
            if (count > 2) {
                break; // We are only interested in exactly two bases
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Solve the task 1
void solveTask1(ofstream& outFile, int N) {
    for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
        if (countBases(n) == 2) {
            outFile << n << '\n';
            return;
        }
    }
}

// Solve the task 2
void solveTask2(ofstream& outFile, int N) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> basesAndSymbols; // To store the bases and symbols

    for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
        if (countBases(n) == 2) {
            for (int b = 2; b <= n; ++b) {
                // Check if n can be represented with three identical symbols in base b
                if (n / b / b == n / b % b && n / b % b == n % b) {
                    basesAndSymbols.push_back(make_pair(b, n / b / b));
                }
                if (basesAndSymbols.size() == 2) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (basesAndSymbols.size() == 2) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the bases and symbols to the output
    for (const auto& baseSymbol : basesAndSymbols) {
        outFile << baseSymbol.first << ' ' << baseSymbol.second << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("cate3cifre.in");
    ofstream outFile("cate3cifre.out");

    int task, N;
    inFile >> task >> N;

    if (task == 1) {
        solveTask1(outFile, N);
    } else if (task == 2) {
        solveTask2(outFile, N);
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, we have a new function `countBases` that counts the number of bases in which a number `n` can be represented with three identical symbols. We then use this function in `solveTask1` to find the largest number less than or equal to `N` that satisfies the condition for exactly two bases. For `solveTask2`, we additionally collect the bases and symbols themselves. The code ensures that we only consider numbers that meet the exact criteria specified in the problem statement.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to an incorrect implementation in the `countBases` function. The function is counting any base where the number n can be represented with three identical symbols, but it does not restrict the counting to bases that are less than the number itself. Therefore, it may count representations like "111" in a base that is higher than n, which should be avoided since for a three-digit representation in base b, the maximum number is b^3 - 1.

To fix the issue, the bases to be considered must be limited to values where b^2 <= n, since for a three-digit number "xxx" in base b, the minimum value in decimal is b^2.

Furthermore, we are only interested in bases where the number can be represented as "xxx", not other forms like "x0x" or "xyx". We need to ensure that the representations are strictly three digits and the three digits are identical.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("cate3cifre.in");
    ofstream outFile("cate3cifre.out");

    int task, N;
    inFile >> task >> N;

    if (task == 1) {
        for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int b = 2; b * b * b > n && b * b <= n; ++b) {
                if (n % b == n / b % b && n / b % b == n / b / b) {
                    count++;
                    if (count > 1) break; // We found two bases, no need to continue
                }
            }
            if (count == 1) {
                outFile << n << '\n';
                break;
            }
        }
    } else if (task == 2) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> basesAndSymbols;
        for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int b = 2; b * b * b > n && b * b <= n; ++b) {
                if (n % b == n / b % b && n / b % b == n / b / b) {
                    basesAndSymbols.push_back({b, n % b});
                    count++;
                    if (count > 1) break; // We found two bases, no need to continue
                }
            }
            if (count == 1) {
                outFile << basesAndSymbols[0].first << ' ' << basesAndSymbols[0].second << '\n';
                outFile << basesAndSymbols[1].first << ' ' << basesAndSymbols[1].second << '\n';
                break;
            }
            basesAndSymbols.clear();
        }
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Now, the `main` function itself handles the logic for both tasks. For each number n starting from N and counting down, we check each base b until `b^3` exceeds n (since we are looking for three identical digits, `b^3` would represent "1000" in base b, which is a four-digit number), but `b^2` must be less than or equal to n to make sure we have a three-digit representation. If the number `n` can be represented with three identical symbols in exactly two bases, we write the result for task 1, or store the bases and symbols for task 2. 

This corrected solution should produce the output consistent with the problem's expectations.

The issue in the previous solution is that we incorrectly specified the condition for breaking out of the loop when two bases are found. The counter `count` should increment only if the number can be written as "xxx" in some base `b`. Additionally, the condition for a number to be representable as "xxx" is incorrect. We should ensure that `b*b <= n < b*b*b` for a number to have a three-digit representation in base `b` (since "100" in base `b` is `b*b` and "1000" in base `b` is `b*b*b`). 

Let's reimplement the solution to address these issues:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("cate3cifre.in");
    ofstream outFile("cate3cifre.out");

    int task, N;
    inFile >> task >> N;

    int result = 0;
    vector<pair<int, int>> basesAndSymbols; // Only used for task 2.

    for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
        basesAndSymbols.clear(); // Clear previous base-symbol pairs.
        for (int b = 2; b * b <= n && b * b * b > n; ++b) {
            // Check for three identical digits "xxx" in base b
            if (n / (b * b) == n / b % b && n / b % b == n % b) {
                basesAndSymbols.emplace_back(b, n % b);
            }
        }
        // Check if we found exactly two bases that meet the criteria
        if (basesAndSymbols.size() == 2) {
            result = n;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Output for task 1
    if (task == 1) {
        outFile << result << '\n';
    }
    // Output for task 2
    else {
        for (const auto& baseSymbol : basesAndSymbols) {
            outFile << baseSymbol.first << ' ' << baseSymbol.second << '\n';
        }
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, the program loops through numbers from `N` down to `100` and, for each number `n`, it checks bases `b` from `2` upwards, ensuring that `n` is strictly between `b*b` (inclusive) and `b*b*b` (exclusive). This guarantees that `n` can be represented as a three-digit number "xxx" in base `b`.

If we find that `n` can be represented with three identical digits in exactly two bases, we store the number `n` for task 1, or store the bases and their digits for task 2.

This corrected solution should now produce the expected output.

The output is incorrect because the program is not correctly identifying the number that can be represented with exactly three identical digits in exactly two different bases. The condition `if (basesAndSymbols.size() == 2)` is incorrect because it only checks if there are two bases that can represent `n` with three identical digits, but it does not ensure these are the only two bases where this representation is possible.

To fix this, we need to ensure that for each `n`, there are no more than two bases where `n` can be represented with three identical digits. We should only increment our count when such a base is found and ensure this count does not exceed two.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to count the number of bases where `n` can be represented by three identical digits
int countBases(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int base = 2; base < n; ++base) {
        int quotient = n / (base * base);
        int remainder = n % (base * base);
        if (quotient > 0 && quotient < base && remainder / base == quotient && remainder % base == quotient) {
            ++count;
            if (count > 2) {
                // If count exceeds 2, we don't need to check further
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("cate3cifre.in");
    ofstream outFile("cate3cifre.out");

    int task, N;
    inFile >> task >> N;
    inFile.close();

    // Task 1 solution
    if (task == 1) {
        for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
            if (countBases(n) == 2) {
                outFile << n << '\n';
                break; // We found our number, so we can break out of the loop
            }
        }
    }
    // Task 2 would be implemented here if needed, following similar logic but storing the bases

    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we have a helper function `countBases` that returns the number of bases where `n` can be represented with three identical digits. The for loop in `main` then iterates downwards from `N` and uses `countBases` to find the first number (the largest number less than or equal to `N`) that has exactly two bases meeting the criteria. Once this number is found, it is written to the output file for task 1.

The `countBases` function considers all bases starting from 2 and going up to but not including `n`, because a number `n` cannot be represented as "xxx" (three identical digits) in a base greater than or equal to `n`. The function checks if the number can be divided into three identical digits by comparing the quotient and remainders after successive divisions by the base squared.

This solution should now output the expected result for the provided input.

The provided code did not produce output because the logic for handling Task 2 was not implemented. The previous explanation and implementation only addressed Task 1, which was to find the largest number less than or equal to `N` that can be written with three identical digits in exactly two different bases.

To fix this, we need to implement the logic for Task 2, which requires finding the two bases and the value of the symbol for the number that fulfills the criteria. Let's write a new solution that correctly implements both Task 1 and Task 2:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to find the two bases where `n` can be represented by three identical digits
vector<pair<int, int>> findBases(int n) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> bases;
    for (int base = 2; base < n; ++base) {
        int quotient = n / (base * base);
        int remainder = n % (base * base);
        if (quotient > 0 && quotient < base && remainder / base == quotient && remainder % base == quotient) {
            bases.emplace_back(base, quotient);
            if (bases.size() > 2) {
                // If more than two bases are found, we clear the vector
                bases.clear();
                return bases;
            }
        }
    }
    return bases;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("cate3cifre.in");
    ofstream outFile("cate3cifre.out");

    int task, N;
    inFile >> task >> N;
    inFile.close();

    if (task == 1) {
        for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
            vector<pair<int, int>> bases = findBases(n);
            if (bases.size() == 2) {
                outFile << n << '\n';
                break; // We found our number, so we can break out of the loop
            }
        }
    } else if (task == 2) {
        for (int n = N; n >= 100; --n) {
            vector<pair<int, int>> bases = findBases(n);
            if (bases.size() == 2) {
                for (const auto& baseSymbol : bases) {
                    outFile << baseSymbol.first << ' ' << baseSymbol.second << '\n';
                }
                break; // We found our bases, so we can break out of the loop
            }
        }
    }

    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we have a function `findBases` that returns the bases (and their symbols) where `n` can be represented with three identical digits. The function iterates over possible bases and checks for the condition where three identical digits can represent `n`. If more than two bases are found, the function returns an empty vector, indicating that the number `n` does not satisfy the criteria.

In `main`, we call `findBases` for each number `n` starting from `N` and decrementing until 100. For Task 1, we write `n` to the output if exactly two bases are found. For Task 2, we write the two bases and their symbols to the output.

This solution should now produce the expected results for both Task 1 and Task 2.
