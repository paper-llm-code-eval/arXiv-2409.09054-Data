În faţa palatului Prinţesei Mofturoase se află $N$ peţitori aşezaţi la coadă, unul în spatele celuilalt. Fiecare poartă sub mantie un număr de pietre preţioase pe care doreşte să le ofere prinţesei ca dar de nuntă. Pentru a nu semăna vrajbă în rândurile lor, prinţesa a decis să-i determine ca $N-1$ dintre ei să renunţe în chip paşnic, peţitorul rămas devenind alesul prinţesei (indiferent de numărul de pietre preţioase deţinute de acesta).

Doi peţitori vecini la coadă se pot înţelege între ei astfel: cel care are mai puţine pietre preţioase pleacă de la coadă primind de la celălalt un număr de pietre astfel încât să plece acasă cu un număr dublu de pietre faţă de câte avea. Dacă doi peţitori au acelaşi număr de pietre, unul din ei (nu contează care) pleacă luând toate pietrele vecinului său. 

Un peţitor se poate înţelege la un moment dat cu unul singur dintre cei doi vecini ai săi. După plecarea unui peţitor, toţi cei din spatele lui avansează.

De exemplu: pentru configuraţia alăturată de $5$ peţitori, un şir posibil de negocieri care conduc la reducerea cozii la un singur peţitor este: se înţeleg vecinii $4$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $4$, se înţeleg apoi $1$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $1$, se înţeleg apoi $3$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $3$, se înţeleg $2$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $5$. Astfel peţitorul $2$ câştigă mâna preafrumoasei prinţese, oferindu-i $0$ pietre preţioase ca dar de nuntă.

# Cerință
Fie $P$ numarul de pietre preţioase pe care le are peţitorul care va deveni alesul prinţesei. Se cer valorile distincte ale lui $P$ la care se poate ajunge prin toate succesiunile de negocieri posibile.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `nunta.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie numărul de peţitori: $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 50$). 
- pe a doua linie, $n$ numere naturale din intervalul $[0, 20]$, reprezentând numărul de pietre preţioase pe care le deţin peţitorii, în ordinea în care stau la coadă. 

# Date de ieșire
Fişierul de ieşire `nunta.out` va conţine:
- pe prima linie  numărul $m$ de valori distincte ce pot fi obţinute
- pe a doua linie cele $m$ valori ordonate crescător, reprezentând valorile care se pot obţine.

This code snippet provides a solution to read from `nunta.in` and write to `nunta.out`, meeting the requirements. It uses recursion to find all distinct outcomes of the suitor selection process described in the challenge. It avoids using `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, and `scanf` for file operations, instead using `ifstream` and `ofstream`. It also uses an `unordered_set` to ensure that only distinct outcomes are recorded before writing the sorted results to `nunta.out`.

Upon reviewing the code and comparing the expected output with the actual output, it appears that the code has a logical error in the way the outcomes are calculated. The code does not correctly simulate all possible sequences of negotiations between suitors. Instead, it only simulates a single path of negotiation, which leads to a single outcome.

To correctly implement the solution, we need to simulate all possible negotiation paths where each suitor interacts with both their left and right neighbors (if available) in each step. This will require a more careful recursion that explores all possible scenarios for each suitor in the queue.

Let's rewrite the solution to fix the bug and simulate all possible outcomes correctly.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

// Recursive function to simulate all possible sequences of negotiations
void simulateNegotiations(std::vector<int> suitors, std::set<int>& outcomes) {
    int n = suitors.size();
    // Base case: if only one suitor is left, add the number of stones to the outcomes
    if (n == 1) {
        outcomes.insert(suitors[0]);
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        std::vector<int> nextSuitors = suitors;
        // Calculate the stones after negotiation between suitors i and i+1
        if (suitors[i] < suitors[i + 1]) {
            nextSuitors[i] = suitors[i] * 2;
        } else {
            nextSuitors[i] = suitors[i] + suitors[i + 1];
        }
        // Remove the suitor at i+1 after negotiation
        nextSuitors.erase(nextSuitors.begin() + i + 1);
        // Simulate further negotiations with the remaining suitors
        simulateNegotiations(nextSuitors, outcomes);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("nunta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("nunta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> suitors(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> suitors[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    std::set<int> outcomes;
    simulateNegotiations(suitors, outcomes);

    // Write the number of outcomes and the sorted unique outcomes to the file
    fout << outcomes.size() << '\n';
    for (const int& outcome : outcomes) {
        fout << outcome << ' ';
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this revised solution, we make sure to:

- Use a `std::set` to store outcomes, which keeps them sorted and unique by default.
- Implement a recursive function `simulateNegotiations` that correctly explores all possible negotiation paths by considering each pair of neighboring suitors.
- Ensure all negotiation outcomes are considered by recursively calling `simulateNegotiations` until only one suitor remains.
- Use `ifstream` and `ofstream` for file I/O to read from `nunta.in` and write to `nunta.out`.

This solution should produce the correct output and match the expected result for the given input.

It seems there is still an error in the implementation of the negotiation logic. In the recursive function `simulateNegotiations`, we are not handling the case properly when two suitors have the same number of stones. According to the problem statement, if two suitors have the same number of stones, one of them leaves, taking all the stones of the other suitor.

Let's rewrite the recursive function `simulateNegotiations` to properly handle this case and fix the solution accordingly.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

// Recursive function to simulate all possible sequences of negotiations
void simulateNegotiations(std::vector<int>& suitors, int start, std::set<int>& outcomes) {
    // When only one suitor is left, add its stones to the outcomes
    if (suitors.size() == 1) {
        outcomes.insert(suitors[0]);
        return;
    }

    for (int i = start; i < suitors.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) { // Suitor negotiates with the suitor to the left
            std::vector<int> nextSuitors = suitors;
            nextSuitors[i - 1] = (nextSuitors[i - 1] < nextSuitors[i]) ? nextSuitors[i - 1] * 2 : nextSuitors[i - 1] + nextSuitors[i];
            nextSuitors.erase(nextSuitors.begin() + i);
            simulateNegotiations(nextSuitors, i - 1, outcomes);
        }
        if (i < suitors.size() - 1) { // Suitor negotiates with the suitor to the right
            std::vector<int> nextSuitors = suitors;
            nextSuitors[i] = (nextSuitors[i] < nextSuitors[i + 1]) ? nextSuitors[i] * 2 : nextSuitors[i] + nextSuitors[i + 1];
            nextSuitors.erase(nextSuitors.begin() + i + 1);
            simulateNegotiations(nextSuitors, i, outcomes);
            // Skip the next suitor if it has the same number of stones to avoid duplicate scenarios
            if (suitors[i] == suitors[i + 1]) {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("nunta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("nunta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> suitors(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> suitors[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    std::set<int> outcomes;
    simulateNegotiations(suitors, 0, outcomes);

    // Write the number of outcomes and the sorted unique outcomes to the file
    fout << outcomes.size() << '\n';
    for (const int& outcome : outcomes) {
        fout << outcome << ' ';
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}

```

The above code now handles the negotiation between two suitors with the same number of stones correctly. It ensures that if two suitors have the same number of stones, one of them takes all the stones of the other and moves on to the next negotiation. This should give us the correct outcomes as expected.

The previous solution still does not produce the expected output because the negotiation logic is not being applied as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the error lies in the way the function calculates the number of stones after a negotiation. When two suitors have the same number of stones, the one that leaves should take all the stones of the other, not just double their own.

Let's correct this issue and rewrite the solution once more:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

void simulate(std::vector<int>& suitors, int pos, std::set<int>& outcomes) {
    // If there is only one suitor left, add the number of stones to outcomes
    if (suitors.size() == 1) {
        outcomes.insert(suitors[0]);
        return;
    }

    // Perform negotiations between the current suitor and the next one
    if (pos < suitors.size() - 1) {
        std::vector<int> next_suitors = suitors;
        // Check if the current suitor has fewer or the same number of stones
        if (next_suitors[pos] <= next_suitors[pos + 1]) {
            next_suitors[pos] = next_suitors[pos] * 2; // Double the stones of the current suitor
            next_suitors.erase(next_suitors.begin() + pos + 1); // Remove the next suitor
        } else {
            next_suitors[pos + 1] = next_suitors[pos + 1] * 2; // Double the stones of the next suitor
            next_suitors.erase(next_suitors.begin() + pos); // Remove the current suitor
        }
        simulate(next_suitors, pos, outcomes); // Continue simulation with the updated list of suitors
    }

    // Perform negotiations between the current suitor and the previous one
    if (pos > 0) {
        std::vector<int> prev_suitors = suitors;
        // Check if the current suitor has fewer or the same number of stones
        if (prev_suitors[pos - 1] <= prev_suitors[pos]) {
            prev_suitors[pos - 1] = prev_suitors[pos - 1] * 2; // Double the stones of the previous suitor
            prev_suitors.erase(prev_suitors.begin() + pos); // Remove the current suitor
        } else {
            prev_suitors[pos] = prev_suitors[pos] * 2; // Double the stones of the current suitor
            prev_suitors.erase(prev_suitors.begin() + pos - 1); // Remove the previous suitor
        }
        simulate(prev_suitors, pos - 1, outcomes); // Continue simulation with the updated list of suitors
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("nunta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("nunta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> suitors(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> suitors[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    std::set<int> outcomes;
    simulate(suitors, 0, outcomes); // Start simulation

    fout << outcomes.size() << "\n";
    for (int outcome : outcomes) {
        fout << outcome << " ";
    }
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, we've made sure to properly address all possible negotiation scenarios as per the problem statement. The recursive `simulate` function now deals with both the cases of a suitor having fewer stones than the next one, as well as the case where they have the same number of stones. The solution explores all the potential paths of negotiation, ensuring that we get the correct outcome. The written results to `nunta.out` should now match the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that the recursive approach implemented in the provided solution is still flawed. The recursive calls are not accurately reflecting all possible negotiation sequences, and as a result, only one outcome is found instead of the expected three.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that every possible pair of neighboring suitors can negotiate in both directions at each step. We also need to handle the case when two suitors have the same number of stones properly. The suitor that leaves should take with them the total number of their neighbor's stones, not double their own.

Let's correct the implementation with these points in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>

void findOutcomes(std::vector<int> suitors, std::set<int>& outcomes) {
    int n = suitors.size();
    // If there's only one suitor left, record their number of stones
    if (n == 1) {
        outcomes.insert(suitors[0]);
        return;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        // Copy the current state of suitors to simulate the negotiations
        std::vector<int> next_suitors(suitors);
        // Perform negotiation between suitor i and suitor i+1
        if (suitors[i] < suitors[i + 1]) {
            next_suitors[i] = suitors[i] * 2; // Suitor i takes double their stones and leaves
            next_suitors.erase(next_suitors.begin() + i + 1); // Suitor i+1 is removed
        } else {
            // If the suitor i has the same or more stones, suitor i+1 takes suitor i's stones and leaves
            next_suitors[i + 1] += suitors[i];
            next_suitors.erase(next_suitors.begin() + i); // Suitor i is removed
        }
        findOutcomes(next_suitors, outcomes); // Recurse with the new state
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("nunta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("nunta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> suitors(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> suitors[i];
    }
    fin.close();

    std::set<int> outcomes;
    findOutcomes(suitors, outcomes); // Start the recursive process

    fout << outcomes.size() << "\n";
    for (auto outcome : outcomes) {
        fout << outcome << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code should now properly capture all the different sequences of negotiations and produce the complete set of distinct outcomes. The `findOutcomes` function recursively explores all paths of negotiation between pairs of neighboring suitors, correctly accounting for the case when two suitors have the same number of stones. The results will be written to `nunta.out` and should now match the expected output.

I apologize for the confusion. The negotiation logic is incorrect in the previous solutions. To fix the bug, we need to consider that when a suitor who has fewer or the same number of stones as their neighbor negotiates, they will leave with double their stones if they have fewer, or all of the neighbor's stones if they have the same amount.

Therefore, I will reimplement the function to consider all possible negotiation paths correctly. Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

// Recursive function to find all possible outcomes
void findAllOutcomes(std::vector<int>& suitors, std::set<int>& outcomes) {
    if (suitors.size() == 1) {
        outcomes.insert(suitors.front()); // If only one suitor remains, insert into outcomes
        return;
    }

    for (size_t i = 0; i < suitors.size() - 1; ++i) {
        std::vector<int> nextSuitors = suitors; // Copy the current list of suitors

        if (suitors[i] <= suitors[i + 1]) {
            // Current suitor negotiates and leaves, next suitor gets their stones either doubled or the same
            nextSuitors[i + 1] += suitors[i];
        } else {
            // Next suitor negotiates and leaves, current suitor gets their stones doubled
            nextSuitors[i] = suitors[i + 1] * 2;
        }

        // Remove the suitor who left (the one with fewer stones or either if equal)
        nextSuitors.erase(nextSuitors.begin() + i);

        // Recurse with the updated list of suitors
        findAllOutcomes(nextSuitors, outcomes);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("nunta.in");
    std::ofstream fout("nunta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> suitors(n);
    for (int& suitor : suitors) {
        fin >> suitor;
    }
    fin.close();

    std::set<int> outcomes;
    findAllOutcomes(suitors, outcomes);

    // Write the number of distinct outcomes and the outcomes themselves
    fout << outcomes.size() << '\n';
    for (int outcome : outcomes) {
        fout << outcome << " ";
    }
    fout << '\n';

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we have a set `outcomes` that stores all unique final numbers of stones after all possible negotiation sequences. We perform a recursive search over all suitors, and at each step, we consider the negotiation between a suitor and their immediate neighbor. We handle the case of equal stones correctly by letting the suitor with equal or fewer stones leave with either double their own stones or all of the neighbor's stones. After every negotiation, we remove the suitor who left and continue the recursion until only one suitor remains.

This corrected implementation should produce the expected output for the provided input.
