Pentru un număr natural nenul `n`, să considerăm toate numerele naturale nenule mai mici sau egale cu `n`, luând fiecare număr de câte două ori: `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ... , n, n`. Aceste numere le amestecăm aleator, şi le aranjăm pe două linii a câte `n` elemente. Structura astfel obţinută o vom numi o bipermutare. În figurile `1, 2` şi `3` avem câte un exemplu de bipermutare pentru `n=5`. 

O bipermutare este perfectă, dacă ambele linii ale structurii reprezintă câte o permutare (vezi figurile `2` şi `3`).

Prin mutare pe poziţia `p`, înţelegem interschimbarea elementelor de pe aceeaşi coloană `p`. În exemplele de mai jos, bipermutarea perfectă din figura `2` s-a obţinut din bipermutarea din figura `1`, aplicând o mutare pe poziţa `2`. Bipermutarea perfectă din figura `3` s-a obţinut din bipermutarea din figura `1`, aplicând mutări pe poziţiile `1, 2, 4` şi `5`.

This C++ code solves the bipermutation problem described. It reads the input from `biperm.in`, performs the logic to find the number of distinct perfect bipermutations and the minimum number of moves to achieve one, writes the results to `biperm.out`, and then prints out a perfect bipermutation obtained from the initial one. The code has been optimized for speed and correctness.

The exit code 137 (128 + 9) typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system due to an out-of-memory condition or it was manually killed using a `kill` command. However, in this context, since we're dealing with a problem-solving scenario and there's no standard out or standard error output, it is likely that the code failed due to a logical error or runtime constraint violation rather than a system-level issue.

One issue with the code is that the `visited` array is not marking pairs of numbers as visited, which can cause an infinite loop. We need to ensure that both numbers in the pair are marked as visited when they are processed.

Let's fix the code by making sure we mark both numbers in the pair as visited and avoid an infinite loop.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("biperm.in");
    ofstream fout("biperm.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    vector<int> topRow(n), bottomRow(n), pos(n + 1);
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> topRow[i];
        pos[topRow[i]] = i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> bottomRow[i];
    }

    int swaps = 0;
    long long components = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[topRow[i]]) {
            visited[topRow[i]] = true;
            visited[bottomRow[i]] = true;
            if (topRow[i] != bottomRow[i]) {
                int cycle = 1;
                for (int j = pos[bottomRow[i]]; topRow[j] != bottomRow[i]; j = pos[bottomRow[j]]) {
                    visited[topRow[j]] = true;
                    visited[bottomRow[j]] = true;
                    swap(topRow[j], bottomRow[j]);
                    swaps++;
                    cycle++;
                }
                components += cycle / 2;
            }
        }
    }

    long long permutations = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < components; ++i) {
        permutations *= 2;
        if (permutations >= 1000000000) {
            permutations %= 1000000000;
        }
    }
    fout << permutations << " " << swaps << "\n";

    for (int num : topRow) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    for (int num : bottomRow) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```
This updated solution should correctly compute the number of distinct perfect bipermutations and the minimum number of moves, as well as output a correct perfect bipermutation. The `visited` array now ensures we do not revisit a pair of numbers and enter an infinite loop. Components are counted correctly as pairs. The maximum limit for the number of permutations is accounted for with a modulo operation.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Without any output in stdout or stderr, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue since exit code 137 generally indicates that the process was terminated by the OS due to memory issues or being manually killed.

However, looking at the initial provided code, there's a potential issue with the way permutations are being calculated. The number of permutations can become extremely large, potentially leading to an integer overflow even before the modulo operation is applied.

Another thing to consider is that the code may be using more memory than allowed, especially if 'n' is very large (up to 10,000). Using vectors of `bool` for `visited` and `int` for `pos` with size `n+1` should not be causing a memory issue on its own for this problem's constraints, but it's worth double-checking the entire algorithm for memory inefficiencies.

Also, the algorithm may be inefficient and could be taking too long to execute, causing a timeout, which might be misinterpreted as a memory issue.

Given these points, let's rewrite the solution ensuring that we're handling the permutations calculation correctly and optimizing the logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("biperm.in");
    ofstream fout("biperm.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    vector<int> topRow(n), bottomRow(n);
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    int swaps = 0;
    int distinct = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> topRow[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> bottomRow[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[topRow[i]]) {
            visited[topRow[i]] = true;
            visited[bottomRow[i]] = true;
            if (topRow[i] != bottomRow[i]) {
                swaps++;
                distinct++;
                visited[topRow[i]] = true;
                visited[bottomRow[i]] = true;
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    if (topRow[j] == bottomRow[i] && bottomRow[j] == topRow[i]) {
                        swap(bottomRow[i], bottomRow[j]);
                        visited[topRow[j]] = true;
                        visited[bottomRow[j]] = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculating number of perfect bipermutations
    long long permutations = 1LL << distinct;
    const long long MOD = 1000000000;
    permutations %= MOD;

    fout << permutations << " " << swaps << "\n";
    for (int num : topRow) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";
    for (int num : bottomRow) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution:
- We optimized the algorithm by removing unnecessary loop iterations.
- We calculate permutations using bitwise shifting to avoid potential overflow issues.
- We continue using `vector<bool>` for the visited array as it's memory efficient.
- We ensure that we swap the right pairs to fix any incorrect bipermutations.

This code should fix the issues with the previous solutions and work within the given constraints.

The differences between the expected and found result indicate that the algorithm failed to properly count the number of distinct bipermutations and the number of swaps to achieve a perfect bipermutation. Additionally, the code did not correctly perform the swaps to achieve a perfect bipermutation.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The number of distinct bipermutations is not computed correctly. The correct computation involves finding the number of independent cycles formed by swapping elements. The found output suggests that the code incorrectly considered each individual swap as a distinct bipermutation, which is not the case. Distinct bipermutations are formed by the number of independent cycles, which is determined by the pairs that need to be swapped to form a correct permutation.

2. The number of swaps made to achieve the perfect bipermutation is incorrect. It is evident that the code failed to identify and perform the correct swaps to arrange the numbers properly.

3. The final arrangement of numbers in the bipermutation is not a perfect bipermutation, as the numbers have not been swapped to their correct positions.

To correct these issues, we need to correctly identify the cycles and count the number of independent cycles. Each independent cycle (except for cycles of length 1, which are already in the correct position) allows us to generate two distinct perfect bipermutations by either leaving it as is or swapping the entire cycle. Therefore, for each independent cycle of length greater than 1, we can double the number of distinct perfect bipermutations. We also need to implement the swapping logic to correctly perform the swaps and achieve a perfect bipermutation.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("biperm.in");
    ofstream fout("biperm.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    vector<int> topRow(n), bottomRow(n), matchTop(n + 1), matchBottom(n + 1);
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    int swaps = 0;
    int cycles = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> topRow[i];
        matchTop[topRow[i]] = i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> bottomRow[i];
        matchBottom[bottomRow[i]] = i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[topRow[i]]) {
            int cycleLen = 0;
            int x = topRow[i];
            
            while (!visited[x]) {
                visited[x] = true;
                int y = bottomRow[matchTop[x]];
                x = topRow[matchBottom[y]];
                cycleLen++;
            }
            
            if (cycleLen > 1) {
                cycles++;
                swaps++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculating number of perfect bipermutations
    long long permutations = 1LL;
    for (int i = 0; i < cycles; ++i) {
        permutations *= 2;
    }
    permutations %= 1000000000; // The problem statement guarantees the result is within this range

    fout << permutations << " " << swaps << "\n";
    for (int num : topRow) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Swap elements to achieve the perfect bipermutation
        if (topRow[i] != bottomRow[i]) {
            swap(bottomRow[i], bottomRow[matchTop[bottomRow[i]]]);
        }

    }
    fout << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly identify and count the number of independent cycles to determine the distinct perfect bipermutations. It also performs the swaps correctly to output a perfect bipermutation, complying with the expected output.

The found output is incorrect, and the issue appears to be with both the cycle detection and the swapping logic. The number of distinct perfect bipermutations is not being calculated correctly, and the swaps to form a perfect bipermutation are not being performed correctly.

The correct way to address this problem is to:
1. Identify positions where the values are not in their correct pairs and track them.
2. Find cycles of incorrect pairs and count how many such cycles exist. Each cycle greater than length 1 will contribute to doubling the number of perfect bipermutations.
3. Perform the swaps necessary to create a perfect bipermutation, keeping track of the minimum number of swaps made.

Let's fix the code by using the right approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("biperm.in");
    ofstream fout("biperm.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    vector<int> topRow(n), bottomRow(n), position(n + 1);
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> topRow[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> bottomRow[i];
        position[bottomRow[i]] = i;
    }

    int swaps = 0;
    int distinctCycles = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[topRow[i]]) {
            int currentPosition = i;
            if (topRow[i] != bottomRow[i]) {
                // We have found a cycle
                distinctCycles++;
                while (!visited[topRow[currentPosition]]) {
                    visited[topRow[currentPosition]] = true;
                    int nextPosition = position[topRow[currentPosition]];
                    swap(bottomRow[currentPosition], topRow[nextPosition]);
                    currentPosition = nextPosition;
                }
                swaps++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculating number of distinct perfect bipermutations
    int permutations = 1 << distinctCycles;

    fout << permutations << " " << swaps << "\n";

    for (int num : topRow) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    for (int num : bottomRow) {
        fout << num << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should now accurately compute the number of distinct perfect bipermutations and perform the minimum number of swaps to achieve a perfect bipermutation, while also outputting the correct perfect bipermutation to match the expected output.

The found output still contains errors. The number of distinct perfect bipermutations is correct, but the number of swaps required to achieve those permutations is not, and the outputted perfect bipermutation is incorrect.

The logic for cycle detection is correct, as each cycle more significant than one contributes to doubling the number of perfect bipermutations. However, we must ensure that we track the swaps correctly and that we actually perform the correct swaps to get the perfect bipermutation in the output.

The algorithm should:
1. Detect cycles by going through unmatched pairs and then swapping them to create a matched pair.
2. Every time we close a cycle, we increment the swap count by one.
3. The number of distinct perfect bipermutations can be calculated by raising 2 to the power of the number of swaps, as for each cycle, we can either swap the elements in the cycle or not, leading to two possibilities per cycle.

Let me present the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("biperm.in");

        topIndex[topRow[i]] = i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> bottomRow[i];
        bottomIndex[bottomRow[i]] = i;

```

This version should correctly output the number of swaps, the number of distinct perfect bipermutations, and the perfect bipermutation itself. It carefully counts and performs the necessary swaps, ensuring that the algorithm doesn't overcount swaps or leave any cycles incomplete.

The found output is incorrect because the code did not properly handle the cycles in the bipermutation. It also did not perform the necessary swaps to create a perfect bipermutation and incorrectly calculated the number of distinct perfect bipermutations.

The correct logic to solve this problem involves identifying pairs that are not in the correct place (i.e., the numbers in the top and bottom rows of the same column should be the same since we start with two of each number). Then, we need to swap these pairs to form a perfect bipermutation. Whenever we find a pair that is in the wrong position, it indicates the presence of a 2-cycle that needs to be swapped. Since all elements appear exactly twice, every swap of a 2-cycle will fix two numbers. After fixing a 2-cycle, we can either leave it as is or swap it back, so each 2-cycle contributes to doubling the number of perfect bipermutations.

Let's correct the code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("biperm.in");
    ofstream fout("biperm.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    vector<int> topRow(n), bottomRow(n);
    vector<int> posTop(n + 1, 0), posBottom(n + 1, 0);

    // Read the rows and store the positions of each number in top and bottom rows.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> topRow[i];
        posTop[topRow[i]] = i;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> bottomRow[i];
        posBottom[bottomRow[i]] = i;
    }

    int perfectBipermutations = 1, minimumSwaps = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // If the numbers in the top and bottom rows are not the same, we have a 2-cycle.
        if (topRow[i] != bottomRow[i]) {
            minimumSwaps++;

            // Find the other position of the top number in the bottom row and swap.
            int otherPos = posBottom[topRow[i]];
            swap(bottomRow[i], bottomRow[otherPos]);
            posBottom[bottomRow[otherPos]] = otherPos;
            posBottom[bottomRow[i]] = i;

            // Each 2-cycle allows for one additional perfect bipermutation (by swapping the cycle or not).
            perfectBipermutations *= 2;
        }
    }

    // Output the results to biperm.out
    fout << perfectBipermutations << " " << minimumSwaps << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << topRow[i] << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << bottomRow[i] << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code should now correctly identify the cycles, count the minimum number of swaps to achieve a perfect bipermutation, calculate the number of perfect bipermutations, and output a perfect bipermutation as expected.
