Construcția unei noi clădiri a fost finalizată! Frank, celebrul arhitect a  făcut o poză cu fațada. Nu este chiar mulțumit de poză deoarece a observat o înclinație a pozei relativ la orizontală. Asta se poate repara printr-o rotație, iar Frank se întreabă dacă procesul de îndreptare nu ar putea fi automatizat.

Cu acest scop, imaginea este transformată într-o mulțime de segmente din plan, detectate automat cu algoritmi speciali, ca în imaginea din dreapta. Segmentele care se obțin sunt identificate prin cele două extremități, puncte având coordonate numere naturale, în sistemul *xOy*: ($x_1$, $y_1$), ($x_2$, $y_2$). Un segment este numit *aliniat* cu axele dacă este orizontal (paralel cu axa *Ox*, deci $y_1=y_2$) sau vertical (paralel cu axa *Oy*, deci $x_1=x_2$).
Prin rotația imaginii în ansamblu, o parte dintre segmente devin *aliniate* cu cele două axe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru o mulțime de segmente determină numărul maxim de segmente care se pot *alinia*, prin rotirea cu un același unghi a tuturor segmentelor. Unghiul de rotație poate fi orice număr real.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `arhitect.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul de segmente $N$ și pe următoarele $N$ linii câte patru numere întregi separate prin câte un spațiu $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, în această ordine, cu semnificația din enunț, coordonatele ce definesc extremitățile segmentelor.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `arhitect.out` conține pe prima linie numărul maxim de segmente determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$ și $1 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;
* Toate segmentele au lungime nenulă;
* Pentru $40$ de puncte, segmentele inițiale sunt paralele cu *Ox*, *Oy* sau cu bisectoarele axelor de coordonate.
* Pentru $60$ de puncte, fără resticții suplimentare.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it's clear that the initial solution did not correctly account for the fact that rotating segments can result in multiple segments sharing the same slope and thus becoming aligned. In the initial solution, the slope of each segment was calculated and stored in a map, incrementing the count of segments with that slope. However, the solution did not consider all possible rotations that could align segments that initially did not have the same slope.

To fix this, we need to calculate not just the initial slopes but consider all unique angles between segments, and for each angle, determine how many segments would be aligned if the entire set of segments were rotated by that angle. To achieve this, we must consider pairs of slopes, as rotating the plane could align segments with initially different slopes.

Since we want to maximize the number of aligned segments, we should count how many times each difference in slope occurs across all pairs of segments. The difference in slope that occurs the most will give us the maximum number of segments that can be aligned via rotation.

The revised implementation will use a map to store the counts of differences in slope and then find the maximum count. Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

pair<int, int> normalizeSlope(int dx, int dy) {
    if (dx == 0) return {0, 1};
    if (dy == 0) return {1, 0};
    int g = __gcd(abs(dx), abs(dy));
    dx /= g;
    dy /= g;
    if (dx < 0) {
        dx = -dx;
        dy = -dy;
    }
    return {dx, dy};
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("arhitect.in");
    ofstream fout("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    vector<pair<int, int>> slopes(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        fin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
        slopes[i] = normalizeSlope(x2 - x1, y2 - y1);
    }

    map<pair<int, int>, int> slopeDifferences;
    int maxAligned = 1; // At least one segment is aligned

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
            // Calculate the difference in slope
            int dx = slopes[i].first * slopes[j].second - slopes[j].first * slopes[i].second;
            int dy = slopes[i].second * slopes[j].first - slopes[j].second * slopes[i].first;

            // Normalize the difference in slope
            pair<int, int> slopeDiff = normalizeSlope(dx, dy);
            slopeDifferences[slopeDiff]++;
            maxAligned = max(maxAligned, slopeDifferences[slopeDiff] + 1); // Add one as each pair contributes to two segments being aligned
        }
    }

    fout << maxAligned << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```
This solution does not have optimal time complexity, as it runs in O(N^2) time, where N is the number of segments. With the constraints given (N <= 100,000), this solution may not be efficient enough, especially considering the large input size. However, it does correct the logic error from the initial attempt and should produce the correct output for smaller cases. For larger cases, more advanced techniques such as line sweeping or rotational calipers may be necessary for an efficient solution.

The error message indicates that `__gcd` was not declared in the scope. This is because `__gcd` is not a standard C++ function. It is a GCC extension provided in the `<algorithm>` header. To fix this compilation error, we need to include the `<algorithm>` header explicitly and use `std::gcd` instead of `__gcd`, which is a standard function available from C++17 onwards.

Here is the revised solution with a fix for the compilation error:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

pair<int, int> normalizeSlope(int dx, int dy) {
    if (dx == 0) return {0, 1};
    if (dy == 0) return {1, 0};
    int g = gcd(abs(dx), abs(dy));
    dx /= g;
    dy /= g;
    if (dx < 0) {
        dx = -dx;
        dy = -dy;
    }
    return {dx, dy};
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("arhitect.in");
    ofstream fout("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    vector<pair<int, int>> slopes(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        fin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
        slopes[i] = normalizeSlope(x2 - x1, y2 - y1);
    }

    map<pair<int, int>, int> slopeDifferences;
    int maxAligned = 1; // At least one segment is aligned

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
            // Calculate the difference in slope
            int dx = slopes[i].first * slopes[j].second - slopes[j].first * slopes[i].second;
            int dy = slopes[i].second * slopes[j].first - slopes[j].second * slopes[i].first;

            // Normalize the difference in slope
            pair<int, int> slopeDiff = normalizeSlope(dx, dy);
            slopeDifferences[slopeDiff]++;
            maxAligned = max(maxAligned, slopeDifferences[slopeDiff] + 1); // Add one as each pair contributes to two segments being aligned
        }
    }

    fout << maxAligned << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution should compile without errors, assuming that C++17 or later is supported by the compiler. The `std::gcd` function is included in the `<algorithm>` header starting from C++17, which will correctly compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) needed for slope normalization.

The error message indicates that `gcd` was not declared in the scope, suggesting that it might still not be available even with the inclusion of the `<algorithm>` header. This could be because the C++17 standard is not enabled in your compiler settings or the compiler version might not support C++17 features. We can define our own gcd function as a fallback.

Let's define our own `gcd` function and modify the solution accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int t = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = t;
    }
    return a;
}

pair<int, int> normalizeSlope(int dx, int dy) {
    if (dx == 0) return {0, 1};
    if (dy == 0) return {1, 0};
    int g = gcd(abs(dx), abs(dy));
    dx /= g;
    dy /= g;
    if (dx < 0) {
        dx = -dx;
        dy = -dy;
    }
    return {dx, dy};
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("arhitect.in");
    ofstream fout("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    vector<pair<int, int>> slopes(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        fin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
        slopes[i] = normalizeSlope(x2 - x1, y2 - y1);
    }

    map<pair<int, int>, int> slopeDifferences;
    int maxAligned = 1; // At least one segment is aligned

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
            // Calculate the difference in slope
            int dx = slopes[i].first * slopes[j].second - slopes[j].first * slopes[i].second;
            int dy = slopes[i].second * slopes[j].first - slopes[j].second * slopes[i].first;

            // Normalize the difference in slope
            pair<int, int> slopeDiff = normalizeSlope(dx, dy);
            slopeDifferences[slopeDiff]++;
            maxAligned = max(maxAligned, slopeDifferences[slopeDiff] + 1); // Add one as each pair contributes to two segments being aligned
        }
    }

    fout << maxAligned << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution now includes its own `gcd` function, which should resolve the compilation error and allow the program to compile successfully without relying on C++17 features or the availability of `std::gcd`.

The differences between the expected and found result indicate a logical error in the algorithm. The current approach attempts to consider all unique angles between segments, counting how many times each difference in slope occurs across all pairs of segments. However, this is incorrect because it doesn't actually align segments; it just compares slopes without considering the effects of rotation on alignment.

The correct approach should be calculating the angle of each segment relative to the x-axis and then finding the angle that, when the entire configuration of segments is rotated by it, would result in the maximum number of segments becoming horizontal or vertical (aligned with the axes). This problem is equivalent to finding the most common angle among all segments. To do this, we can store the angles in a map and keep track of the count of each angle.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

// Function to calculate the angle of a segment with respect to the x-axis
double calculateAngle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    return atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1);
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("arhitect.in");
    ofstream fout("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    map<double, int> angleCounts;
    int maxAligned = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        fin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
        double angle = calculateAngle(x1, y1, x2, y2);

        // Normalize the angle to be within [0, PI/2)
        angle = fmod(angle, PI / 2);
        if (angle < 0) {
            angle += PI / 2;
        }

        angleCounts[angle]++;
        maxAligned = max(maxAligned, angleCounts[angle]);
    }

    fout << maxAligned << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this revised solution, the `calculateAngle` function computes the angle of the segment relative to the x-axis using `atan2`. We store each normalized angle (within the range of `[0, PI/2)`) in a map, and count the occurrences. The answer is the maximum count of any angle, which represents the number of segments that can be aligned after rotation.

This solution should produce the correct output for the given example and should work correctly within the constraints specified in the problem statement.

The differences between the expected and found result suggest that the revised solution fails to account for the fact that a rotation aligns segments with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis. In the current approach, we are considering only the angles with respect to the x-axis, which is insufficient for this task.

We must consider that when we rotate the segments by an angle `θ`, we're not only interested in the segments that become horizontal (aligned with the x-axis), but also in those that become vertical (aligned with the y-axis). Thus, we should consider the perpendicular angles as well.

To fix this issue, the solution should store both the angle and its perpendicular angle (angle + π/2) because a segment that is not aligned with the x-axis might be aligned with the y-axis after rotation.

Here's the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const double EPSILON = 1e-9;

double normalizeAngle(double angle) {
    while (angle < -EPSILON) angle += 2 * M_PI;
    while (angle >= M_PI / 2 + EPSILON) angle -= M_PI / 2;
    return angle;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("arhitect.in");
    ofstream fout("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    map<double, int> angleCounts;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        fin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
        double angle = atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1);

        // Normalize the angle to be within [0, PI/2)
        angle = normalizeAngle(angle);

        // Increment the count for this angle and its perpendicular angle
        angleCounts[angle]++;
        angleCounts[normalizeAngle(angle + M_PI / 2)]++;
    }

    // Find the maximum count of any angle
    int maxAligned = 0;
    for (const auto &entry : angleCounts) {
        maxAligned = max(maxAligned, entry.second);
    }

    fout << maxAligned << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, `normalizeAngle` function ensures that the angle is within the correct range `[0, PI/2)`. When incrementing the counts in the map, we also consider the perpendicular angle (angle + π/2). The max count is then the maximum number of segments that can be aligned after rotation.

The use of `EPSILON` is to handle floating-point comparison issues that may arise during normalization.

This solution should produce the correct output for the given example and should correctly count the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by considering both the angle and its perpendicular.

The differences between the expected and found result are due to a logical error in handling the angles. The solution incorrectly increments counts for the angle and its perpendicular, effectively considering each segment twice, which leads to an inflated count.

The correct approach is to calculate the smallest angle that each segment makes with the x-axis, which will be between 0 and π/2, and then find the most frequent angle. This angle, when subtracted from all segments, will align the maximum number of segments either horizontally or vertically.

Here's the revised solution that should fix the logical error and correctly calculate the most frequent angle:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

// Function to normalize the angle within the range [0, PI/2)
double normalizeAngle(double angle) {
    angle = fmod(angle, PI);
    if (angle < 0) angle += PI;
    if (angle > PI / 2) angle = PI - angle;
    return angle;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("arhitect.in");
    ofstream fout("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    map<double, int> freq;
    double angle;
    int maxAligned = 0;
    int x1, y1, x2, y2;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
        angle = normalizeAngle(atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1));
        freq[angle]++;
    }

    for (const auto &p : freq) {
        maxAligned = max(maxAligned, p.second);
    }

    fout << maxAligned << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads each segment, calculates the smallest angle it makes with the x-axis and then normalizes this angle within the range [0, π/2). It then counts how many times each normalized angle appears and determines the maximum count. This maximum count represents the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by a single rotation.

The `normalizeAngle` function ensures that the angle is within the correct range by using the `fmod` function to apply modulus operation and adjusting the range accordingly. This should now produce the correct output for the given example.
