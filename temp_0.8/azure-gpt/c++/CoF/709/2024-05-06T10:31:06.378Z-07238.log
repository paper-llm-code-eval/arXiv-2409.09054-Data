O triangulație a unui poligon convex este o mulțime formată din diagonale ale poligonului care nu se intersectează în interiorul poligonului ci numai în vârfuri și care împart toată suprafața poligonului în triunghiuri.

# Cerință

Fiind dat un poligon cu $n$ vârfuri notate $1, 2, ..., n$ să se genereze toate triangulațiile distincte ale poligonului. Două triangulații sunt distincte dacă diferă prin cel puțin o diagonală.

# Date de intrare


În fișierul text `triang.in` se află pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând valoarea lui $n$.

# Date de ieșire


În fișierul text `triang.out` se vor scrie:

- pe prima linie, numărul de triangulații distincte;
- pe fiecare din următoarele linii codul unei triangulații, în orice ordine. Codul este format cu ajutorul diagonalelor ce compun triangulația. O diagonală va fi precizată prin două numere reprezentând cele două vârfuri care o definesc.
$\text{cod = } \prod {( \min(d_1,d_2)\cdot 137+\max(d_1,d_2) )} \text{ mod } (10^9+7)$, unde $d_1$ și $d_2$ sunt vârfurile unei diagonale din descompunere, produsul făcându-se peste toate diagonalele din descompunere (se consideră $1$ pentru mulțimea vidă).


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 16$
* Se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj doar pentru numărul de triangulații distincte
* Enunțul si restricțiile au fost modificate

This C++ code is designed to solve the triangulation challenge, although it may need further optimization to be the most efficient in terms of execution speed. The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to calculate the number of distinct triangulations and backtracking to generate individual triangulations' codes. The `MOD` is used to ensure the product of diagonals' codes doesn't overflow. The input and output are handled using `ifstream` and `ofstream` for file reading and writing.

The previous solution has several issues. The most critical problem is that it doesn't correctly calculate the codes for the triangulations and appears to be generating combinations of diagonals that don't form valid triangulations. The code also seems to have a misunderstanding of how to apply the formula given in the problem statement to generate the codes.

Let's address these issues and provide a correct implementation. The correct approach to this problem is to apply a recursive backtracking algorithm to find all valid triangulations of the polygon and for each triangulation calculate its unique code according to the given formula. We utilize a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to count the number of triangulations, then backtrack to generate the codes.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;
const int MAXN = 17;
int dp[MAXN][MAXN];
std::vector<std::vector<int>> codes;
int n;

int calculate(int i, int j) {
    if (dp[i][j] != -1)
        return dp[i][j];

    if (j == i + 1) // Adjacent vertices, no diagonals in between
        return dp[i][j] = 1;

    dp[i][j] = 0;
    for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
        long long ways = ((long long)calculate(i, k) * calculate(k, j)) % MOD;
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + ways) % MOD;
    }

    return dp[i][j];
}

void backtrack(int i, int j, int prod, std::vector<int>& diagonals) {
    if (j == i + 1) { // Found a valid triangulation
        codes.push_back(diagonals);
        return;
    }

    for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
        long long code = (((long long)std::min(i, k) * 137 + std::max(i, k)) % MOD * prod) % MOD;
        diagonals.push_back(code);
        backtrack(i, k, code, diagonals);
        backtrack(k, j, code, diagonals);
        diagonals.pop_back();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    fin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = -1;
        }
    }

    calculate(1, n);

    std::vector<int> diagonals;
    backtrack(1, n, 1, diagonals);

    fout << codes.size() << '\n';
    for (const std::vector<int>& diag_code : codes) {
        long long final_code = 1;
        for (int code : diag_code) {
            final_code = (final_code * code) % MOD;
        }
        fout << final_code << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code first calculates the number of triangulations using dynamic programming with a memoization table `dp`. Then, it uses a backtracking function `backtrack` to generate a list of codes for each triangulation, which are then output to the file `triang.out`.

Please note that in the backtracking function, we must calculate the final code for each triangulation by multiplying the individual codes for each diagonal. That's done in the loop at the end of the `main` function, where `final_code` is calculated.

This solution should now generate the correct codes and write the correct output to `triang.out`.

The previous implementation was incorrect because it did not accurately reflect the definition of a triangulation code provided in the problem. The issue lies primarily in the way the triangulations are being generated and how diagonals are being combined to form the codes. The backtracking function seems to be generating too many codes, and the final code computation is incorrect.

Let's address the issues with the proper solution. We will use dynamic programming to count the number of triangulations and then backtrack to generate the correct codes for each distinct triangulation.

Here is the corrected and simplified code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;
int dp[17][17];
std::vector<long long> codes;
int n;

// Calculate the number of distinct triangulations using dynamic programming.
int countTriangulations(int left, int right) {
    if (left + 1 >= right) return 1;
    if (dp[left][right] != -1) return dp[left][right];

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = left + 1; i < right; ++i) {
        count = (count + (long long)countTriangulations(left, i) * countTriangulations(i, right)) % MOD;
    }

    return dp[left][right] = count;
}

// Backtrack to generate all distinct triangulation codes.
void generateCodes(int left, int right, long long prod) {
    if (left + 2 == right) {
        codes.push_back(prod);
        return;
    }

    for (int i = left + 1; i < right; ++i) {
        long long new_prod = prod * (left * 137LL + i) % MOD;
        generateCodes(left, i, new_prod);
        generateCodes(i, right, new_prod);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    fin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < 17; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 17; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = -1;
        }
    }

    int triangulationCount = countTriangulations(1, n);
    generateCodes(1, n, 1);

    fout << triangulationCount << '\n';
    for (long long code : codes) {
        fout << (code % MOD) << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `countTriangulations` function to count the number of distinct triangulations of a polygon using dynamic programming. The `generateCodes` function is supposed to generate the correct codes for each triangulation. These codes are then written to the `triang.out` file.

However, there is still a mistake in the code above. The `generateCodes` function should not multiply the current product with the same diagonal multiple times. We should instead consider only one diagonal at a time and make sure to pass the product of all chosen diagonals to the next recursive call. Also, we must loop through all possible diagonals between `left` and `right` to create distinct triangulations. Here is the corrected version of the backtracking part:

```cpp
void generateCodes(int left, int right, long long prod, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& diagonals) {
    if (left + 1 >= right) {
        if (diagonals.size() == n - 3) {
            long long code = 1;
            for (auto &d : diagonals) {
                code = (code * (d.first * 137LL + d.second)) % MOD;
            }
            codes.push_back(code);
        }
        return;
    }

    for (int i = left + 1; i < right; ++i) {
        diagonals.push_back({std::min(left, i), std::max(left, i)});
        generateCodes(left, i, prod, diagonals);
        generateCodes(i, right, prod, diagonals);
        diagonals.pop_back();
    }
}
```
And in the `main` function, you should create a `vector` to hold the diagonals and pass it to `generateCodes` like so:

```cpp
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> diagonals;
generateCodes(1, n, 1, diagonals);
```

After these corrections, the program should produce the expected output for the given input.

The output differs from the expected results because the code has a logical error in the `generateCodes` function. In the previous solution, it tries to generate codes for triangulations by iterating over all pairs of vertices for each recursive call. However, it does not correctly handle the triangulations as per the restriction that the diagonals must not intersect and each triangulation must be distinct. To address this, we should correctly track the diagonals being added to form a triangulation and ensure we only record complete triangulations.

Let's rewrite `generateCodes` correctly to only generate codes for complete triangulations. We will use an auxiliary function to combine the diagonals into the expected code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000000007;
const int MAXN = 17;
int dp[MAXN][MAXN];
std::vector<std::vector<int>> triangulations;

// Calculate the number of distinct triangulations using dynamic programming.
int countTriangulations(int left, int right) {
    if (left + 1 >= right) return 1;
    if (dp[left][right] != -1) return dp[left][right];

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = left + 1; i < right; ++i) {
        count = (count + (long long)countTriangulations(left, i) * countTriangulations(i, right)) % MOD;
    }

    return dp[left][right] = count;
}

// Generate a code for a triangulation based on its diagonals.
long long generateCode(const std::vector<int>& diagonals) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (int diag : diagonals) {
        code = (code * diag) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

// Backtrack to generate all distinct triangulation codes.
void backtrack(int left, int right, std::vector<int>& diagonals) {
    if (left + 1 >= right) {
        if (diagonals.size() == n - 3) { // Complete triangulation
            triangulations.push_back(diagonals);
        }
        return;
    }

    for (int i = left + 1; i < right; ++i) {
        int diag = (std::min(left, i) * 137 + std::max(left, i)) % MOD;
        diagonals.push_back(diag);
        backtrack(left, i, diagonals);
        backtrack(i, right, diagonals);
        diagonals.pop_back();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    fin >> n;
    std::fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + sizeof(dp) / sizeof(dp[0][0]), -1);

    int triangulationCount = countTriangulations(1, n);

    std::vector<int> diagonals;
    backtrack(1, n, diagonals);

    fout << triangulationCount << '\n';
    for (const auto& diag : triangulations) {
        fout << generateCode(diag) << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The corrected `backtrack` function now ensures that we only consider triangulations that use exactly `n - 3` diagonals (for a polygon with `n` vertices, a triangulation consists of `n - 3` diagonals). The `generateCode` function computes the code for a single triangulation based on its diagonals.

This implementation should now produce the expected output for the given input, provided the rest of the logic is correct. The `backtrack` function should be careful to avoid intersecting diagonals by choosing only the next possible vertices to create the diagonal that is part of a valid triangulation. The `generateCode` function correctly applies the given formula for the code of a triangulation.
