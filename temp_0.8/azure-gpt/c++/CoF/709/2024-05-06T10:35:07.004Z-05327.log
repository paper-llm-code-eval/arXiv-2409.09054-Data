O triangulație a unui poligon convex este o mulțime formată din diagonale ale poligonului care nu se intersectează în interiorul poligonului ci numai în vârfuri și care împart toată suprafața poligonului în triunghiuri.

# Cerință

Fiind dat un poligon cu $n$ vârfuri notate $1, 2, ..., n$ să se genereze toate triangulațiile distincte ale poligonului. Două triangulații sunt distincte dacă diferă prin cel puțin o diagonală.

# Date de intrare


În fișierul text `triang.in` se află pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând valoarea lui $n$.

# Date de ieșire


În fișierul text `triang.out` se vor scrie:

- pe prima linie, numărul de triangulații distincte;
- pe fiecare din următoarele linii codul unei triangulații, în orice ordine. Codul este format cu ajutorul diagonalelor ce compun triangulația. O diagonală va fi precizată prin două numere reprezentând cele două vârfuri care o definesc.
$\text{cod = } \prod {( \min(d_1,d_2)\cdot 137+\max(d_1,d_2) )} \text{ mod } (10^9+7)$, unde $d_1$ și $d_2$ sunt vârfurile unei diagonale din descompunere, produsul făcându-se peste toate diagonalele din descompunere (se consideră $1$ pentru mulțimea vidă).


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 16$
* Se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj doar pentru numărul de triangulații distincte
* Enunțul si restricțiile au fost modificate

The initially provided implementation contains a logical error in the way it attempts to generate triangulations and calculate their codes. The recursive procedure `genTriangulations` incorrectly attempts to place diagonals, which results in missing some valid triangulations and generating invalid ones.

A correct approach should involve using a recursive backtracking algorithm that selects a diagonal, adds it to the current triangulation, and then recursively tries to triangulate the two resulting sub-polygons.

Here's the corrected implementation:
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;

void backtrack(int start, int n, std::vector<int>& diagonals, std::vector<long long>& codes) {
    if (start >= n - 1) {
        long long code = 1;
        for (auto diag : diagonals) {
            int d1 = diag / n, d2 = diag % n;
            code = (code * ((std::min(d1, d2) * 137LL + std::max(d1, d2)) % MOD)) % MOD;
        }
        codes.push_back(code);
        return;
    }

    for (int end = start + 2; end < n; ++end) {
        diagonals.push_back(start * n + end);
        backtrack(start + 1, end, diagonals, codes);
        diagonals.pop_back();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<int> diagonals;
    std::vector<long long> codes;
    backtrack(0, n, diagonals, codes);

    fout << codes.size() << '\n';
    for (auto code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The corrected implementation defines a backtrack function that correctly generates all distinct triangulations for a given convex polygon with n vertices. It maintains a list of diagonals (represented as integers) for the current triangulation. For each recursive call, it chooses a starting point and tries to connect it with every possible non-adjacent vertex to form a diagonal. After adding a new diagonal, it recursively triangulates the sub-polygons formed by this diagonal. When the base case is reached (i.e., no more vertices to connect), it calculates the code of the current triangulation and stores it.

This solution should provide the correct outputs and match the expected results for the given problem.

The updated implementation still has a logical error in the backtracking approach; it doesn't correctly handle the sub-problems of triangulating the two sub-polygons created after adding a diagonal. Instead, it only moves to the next vertex in the original polygon without considering the two separate sub-polygons.

Let's correct the approach. To generate all distinct triangulations, we need a function that will handle the sub-polygons independently. After selecting a diagonal that divides the polygon into two, we need to triangulate the two resulting sub-polygons separately. We will also use a helper function to calculate the code for a given triangulation.

Here's the corrected solution:
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MAX_N = 17;
const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
std::vector<long long> codes;
bool used[MAX_N][MAX_N] = {false};

long long computeCode(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> &diagonals, int n) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (const auto& d : diagonals) {
        code = (code * ((std::min(d.first, d.second) * 137LL + std::max(d.first, d.second)) % MOD)) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

void findTriangulations(int n, int left, int right, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> &diagonals) {
    if (left + 1 == right) {
        if (diagonals.size() == n - 3) { // A triangulation is found
            long long code = computeCode(diagonals, n);
            codes.push_back(code);
        }
        return;
    }

    for (int i = left + 1; i < right; ++i) {
        if (!used[left][i] && !used[i][right]) {
            used[left][i] = used[i][right] = true;
            diagonals.emplace_back(left, i);
            diagonals.emplace_back(i, right);

            findTriangulations(n, left, i, diagonals);
            findTriangulations(n, i, right, diagonals);

            diagonals.pop_back();
            diagonals.pop_back();
            used[left][i] = used[i][right] = false;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> diagonals;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        used[i][i + 1] = true;
    }
    used[n - 1][0] = true; // Mark the sides of the polygon as used

    findTriangulations(n, 0, n - 1, diagonals);

    fout << codes.size() << '\n';
    for (auto code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```
In this corrected solution, we use a recursive function `findTriangulations` to find all distinct triangulations of a given polygon with `n` vertices. We keep track of used diagonals with a boolean array to avoid creating intersecting diagonals. For each possible diagonal that can be added without intersecting others, we add it to the current triangulation, mark it as used, and then recursively triangulate the resulting two sub-polygons. Once we cannot add more diagonals, we compute the code of the resulting triangulation if it has the correct number of diagonals (n - 3) and store it. After the recursive calls, we unmark the diagonals and remove them from the current triangulation. The recursive function is initially called with the indices of the leftmost and rightmost vertices of the polygon.

This solution should match the expected output and correctly count and generate the codes for all triangulations of a convex polygon with `n` vertices.

The previous implementation incorrectly handles the triangulation process. Specifically, the recursive function does not correctly manage the state of used edges and the conditions to add a diagonal are not adequate, causing no triangulations to be found.

The backtracking process for triangulating a polygon requires careful handling of the state of the polygon as diagonals are added. When we place a diagonal, it splits the polygon into two smaller polygons. We need to triangulate these two smaller polygons independently.

Below is a revised solution that implements the backtracking algorithm properly. This revised implementation should produce the correct output by recursively finding all the triangulations for the smaller polygons created by adding a diagonal.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
std::vector<long long> triangulations;
std::vector<std::vector<bool>> connected;
int n;

long long calculateCode(const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& triangulation) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (const auto& diag : triangulation) {
        int d1 = diag.first, d2 = diag.second;
        code = (code * ((std::min(d1, d2) * 137LL + std::max(d1, d2)) % MOD)) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

void generateTriangulations(int left, int right, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& current) {
    if (right - left == 1) {
        if (current.size() == n - 3) {
            triangulations.push_back(calculateCode(current));
        }
        return;
    }

    for (int i = left + 1; i < right; ++i) {
        if (!connected[left][i]) {
            connected[left][i] = connected[i][left] = true;
            current.emplace_back(left, i);

            generateTriangulations(left, i, current);
            generateTriangulations(i, right, current);

            current.pop_back();
            connected[left][i] = connected[i][left] = false;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> currentTriangulation;
    connected.assign(n, std::vector<bool>(n, false));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        connected[i][(i + 1) % n] = connected[(i + 1) % n][i] = true; // Mark the edges of the polygon as connected
    }

    generateTriangulations(0, n - 1, currentTriangulation);

    fout << triangulations.size() << '\n';
    for (const auto& code : triangulations) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```
In this solution, we define a function `generateTriangulations` that recursively generates all valid triangulations of a polygon with `n` vertices. We use a 2D vector `connected` to keep track of which vertices are already connected by an edge or a diagonal, which helps us avoid intersecting diagonals. For each recursive call, we add a diagonal that doesn't intersect with others and recursively triangulate the two resulting sub-polygons. The base case checks if the current triangulation has exactly `n - 3` diagonals, which means a complete triangulation is formed.

This revised solution should now correctly identify all distinct triangulations of the polygon and calculate their codes as described in the problem statement.
