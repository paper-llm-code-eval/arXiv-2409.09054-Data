O triangulație a unui poligon convex este o mulțime formată din diagonale ale poligonului care nu se intersectează în interiorul poligonului ci numai în vârfuri și care împart toată suprafața poligonului în triunghiuri.

# Cerință

Fiind dat un poligon cu $n$ vârfuri notate $1, 2, ..., n$ să se genereze toate triangulațiile distincte ale poligonului. Două triangulații sunt distincte dacă diferă prin cel puțin o diagonală.

# Date de intrare


În fișierul text `triang.in` se află pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând valoarea lui $n$.

# Date de ieșire


În fișierul text `triang.out` se vor scrie:

- pe prima linie, numărul de triangulații distincte;
- pe fiecare din următoarele linii codul unei triangulații, în orice ordine. Codul este format cu ajutorul diagonalelor ce compun triangulația. O diagonală va fi precizată prin două numere reprezentând cele două vârfuri care o definesc.
$\text{cod = } \prod {( \min(d_1,d_2)\cdot 137+\max(d_1,d_2) )} \text{ mod } (10^9+7)$, unde $d_1$ și $d_2$ sunt vârfurile unei diagonale din descompunere, produsul făcându-se peste toate diagonalele din descompunere (se consideră $1$ pentru mulțimea vidă).


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 16$
* Se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj doar pentru numărul de triangulații distincte
* Enunțul si restricțiile au fost modificate

This code should compute all distinct triangulations for a polygon with `n` vertices and write the number of triangulations as well as their codes to `triang.out`. The code uses a dynamic programming approach for efficient computation and a hashing function to generate unique codes for each triangulation.

By analyzing the differences between the expected output and the found output, it is clear that the algorithm is not generating the correct number of triangulations, and the codes are not being computed correctly. There are several flaws in the provided code:

1. The dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is not used correctly. It should store the count of triangulations for a particular segment of the polygon, not the code itself.
2. The recursive function `findAllTriangulations` is not correctly computing all possible triangulations. It is supposed to explore all combinations of diagonals that partition the polygon into triangles, but it is not doing that correctly.
3. The base case of the recursion is not correct. We can directly form a triangle when exactly three vertices are involved, which is when `r - l == 2`.
4. The calculation of the hash code for each triangulation is incorrect. The code should be multiplied for each diagonal in the triangulation, not updated for every recursive call.

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
ifstream fin("triang.in");
ofstream fout("triang.out");

int n;
vector<vector<int>> dp;

int64_t hashDiagonal(int d1, int d2) {
    return (1LL * min(d1, d2) * 137 + max(d1, d2)) % MOD;
}

int countTriangulations(int l, int r) {
    if (l + 1 == r) return 1;  // Base case: single edge, no diagonals
    if (dp[l][r] != -1) return dp[l][r];  // Use memoization to avoid recomputing

    dp[l][r] = 0;
    for (int i = l + 1; i < r; ++i) {
        // Split the polygon into two parts and multiply the number of triangulations
        dp[l][r] += (1LL * countTriangulations(l, i) * countTriangulations(i, r)) % MOD;
        dp[l][r] %= MOD;
    }

    return dp[l][r];
}

void findAllTriangulations(int l, int r, int64_t code) {
    if (l + 1 == r) {
        fout << code << '\n';  // Found a complete triangulation
        return;
    }

    for (int i = l + 1; i < r; ++i) {
        // Combine the current diagonal's hash code and recursively find triangulations
        int64_t newCode = (code * hashDiagonal(l + 1, i + 1)) % MOD;
        findAllTriangulations(l, i, newCode);
        findAllTriangulations(i, r, newCode);
    }
}

int main() {
    fin >> n;
    dp.assign(n, vector<int>(n, -1));

    int totalCount = countTriangulations(0, n - 1);  // Count the number of triangulations first
    fout << totalCount << '\n';

    findAllTriangulations(0, n - 1, 1);  // Find all the triangulations and write the codes

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code first counts the total number of triangulations using dynamic programming and memoization. Then, it uses a recursive function to generate all triangulations and compute their hash codes. The base case for the recursion is now correctly defined as when exactly two vertices are involved, meaning no additional diagonals can be drawn. The hash code calculation is properly applied to each triangulation. This should result in the correct output.

The updated code still has issues:

1. The `countTriangulations` function is counting the number of distinct triangulations, but it is not storing any specific triangulation, so it can't be used to output triangulation codes later.
2. The `findAllTriangulations` function is not correctly tracking which diagonals have been used. It needs to ensure that each triangulation code it outputs is for a complete and distinct triangulation of the polygon.
3. The `findAllTriangulations` function is also not terminating correctly when a full triangulation is found because it attempts to continue even after finding a valid triangulation.

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Use a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate all the unique triangulations.
2. Compute the code for each triangulation.
3. Ensure that we do not output the same triangulation more than once.
4. Properly terminate the recursive calls when a full triangulation is found.

Let's rewrite the solution with these fixes in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
ifstream fin("triang.in");
ofstream fout("triang.out");

int n;
vector<vector<int>> dp;
vector<int64_t> triangulationCodes;

int64_t hashDiagonal(int d1, int d2) {
    return (1LL * min(d1, d2) * 137 + max(d1, d2)) % MOD;
}

void backtrack(int start, int end, vector<int> &path, int64_t code) {
    if (start == end) {
        triangulationCodes.push_back(code);
        return;
    }

    for (int i = start + 2; i <= end; ++i) {
        if (dp[start][i] == -1) continue; // If this subproblem has no solution, skip it
        int64_t newCode = (code * hashDiagonal(start + 1, i + 1)) % MOD;
        int prevSize = path.size();
        path.push_back(i);
        backtrack(i, end, path, newCode);
        path.resize(prevSize); // Backtrack to previous state
    }
}

int main() {
    fin >> n;
    dp.assign(n, vector<int>(n, -1));
    dp[0][n - 1] = 1; // Initialize the base case

    // Count the number of triangulations using dynamic programming
    for (int length = 2; length < n; ++length) {
        for (int i = 0; i + length < n; ++i) {
            int j = i + length;
            for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                if (dp[i][k] != -1 && dp[k][j] != -1) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Generate all unique triangulations
    vector<int> path;
    path.push_back(0);
    backtrack(0, n - 1, path, 1);

    // Write results to file
    fout << triangulationCodes.size() << '\n';
    for (int64_t code : triangulationCodes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code should properly count and generate all distinct triangulations for the polygon with `n` vertices and output the correct triangulation codes to `triang.out`. The `backtrack` function ensures that we explore all possible unique triangulations by recursively choosing diagonals that divide the polygon into smaller segments and calculating the code as we go along. The `dp` table is used to store whether a segment of the polygon can be triangulated, not the number of ways it can be triangulated, which simplifies the code and fixes the previous error.

The provided solution still does not generate the expected output. The primary issue is that the code is failing to generate all the distinct triangulations. The `backtrack` function is not correctly exploring all possible triangulations because it terminates too early and doesn't explore all combinations of diagonals. Additionally, the dynamic programming table `dp` is being used incorrectly; it should be used to count the number of distinct triangulations of a sub-polygon, not to check the feasibility of a split.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct algorithm:

1. Implement a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate all possible triangulations of the polygon by choosing valid diagonals.
2. Use a proper method to compute the code for each triangulation based on the chosen diagonals.
3. Collect the codes for distinct triangulations in an ordered set to prevent duplicates.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
ifstream fin("triang.in");
ofstream fout("triang.out");

int n;
set<int64_t> triangulationCodes;
vector<vector<bool>> dp;

int64_t hashDiagonal(int d1, int d2) {
    return (1LL * min(d1, d2) * 137 + max(d1, d2)) % MOD;
}

void backtrack(int start, int end, vector<int> &diagonals, int64_t code) {
    if (end - start == 1) { // Only two vertices left, base case
        triangulationCodes.insert(code); // Complete triangulation found
        return;
    }

    for (int i = start + 2; i < end; ++i) { // Skip adjacent vertices
        int64_t newCode = (code * hashDiagonal(start + 1, i + 1)) % MOD;
        backtrack(start, i, diagonals, newCode); // Triangulate left sub-polygon
        backtrack(i, end, diagonals, newCode);   // Triangulate right sub-polygon
    }
}

int main() {
    fin >> n;

    vector<int> diagonals; // To store the current set of diagonals
    diagonals.reserve(n);

    // Set up the DP table to count triangulations (initially all false)
    dp.assign(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        dp[i][i + 1] = true; // Base cases: two consecutive vertices form an edge, not a diagonal
    }

    // Backtracking to generate all triangulation codes
    backtrack(0, n - 1, diagonals, 1);

    // Write results to file
    fout << triangulationCodes.size() << '\n';
    for (const auto &code : triangulationCodes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses backtracking to explore all possible triangulations by recursively selecting valid diagonals and calculates the code for each triangulation. The results are stored in an ordered set to ensure uniqueness. Finally, the unique codes are written to the output file `triang.out`. This should match the expected output by generating all valid triangulations with the correct codes.
