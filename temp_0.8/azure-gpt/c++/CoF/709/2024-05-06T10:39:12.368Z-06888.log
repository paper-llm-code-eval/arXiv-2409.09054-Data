O triangulație a unui poligon convex este o mulțime formată din diagonale ale poligonului care nu se intersectează în interiorul poligonului ci numai în vârfuri și care împart toată suprafața poligonului în triunghiuri.

# Cerință

Fiind dat un poligon cu $n$ vârfuri notate $1, 2, ..., n$ să se genereze toate triangulațiile distincte ale poligonului. Două triangulații sunt distincte dacă diferă prin cel puțin o diagonală.

# Date de intrare


În fișierul text `triang.in` se află pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând valoarea lui $n$.

# Date de ieșire


În fișierul text `triang.out` se vor scrie:

- pe prima linie, numărul de triangulații distincte;
- pe fiecare din următoarele linii codul unei triangulații, în orice ordine. Codul este format cu ajutorul diagonalelor ce compun triangulația. O diagonală va fi precizată prin două numere reprezentând cele două vârfuri care o definesc.
$\text{cod = } \prod {( \min(d_1,d_2)\cdot 137+\max(d_1,d_2) )} \text{ mod } (10^9+7)$, unde $d_1$ și $d_2$ sunt vârfurile unei diagonale din descompunere, produsul făcându-se peste toate diagonalele din descompunere (se consideră $1$ pentru mulțimea vidă).


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 16$
* Se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj doar pentru numărul de triangulații distincte
* Enunțul si restricțiile au fost modificate

Upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that the algorithm does not correctly implement the triangulation process. Specifically, it seems to be incorrectly generating and combining the diagonals, leading to repeated and invalid triangulations.

To fix this, we need to ensure that each recursive call correctly partitions the polygon into smaller polygons and that diagonals are only added when they create valid triangulations. Also, we need to track which vertices have been connected and only generate triangulations for the remaining polygon sections.

Here's a revised version of the solution that addresses these issues:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

void backtrack(int start, int n, int last, std::vector<int>& diagonals, std::vector<long long>& codes) {
    if (start == n) {
        long long code = 1;
        for (int diagonal : diagonals) {
            int d1 = diagonal / n;
            int d2 = diagonal % n;
            code = (code * (std::min(d1, d2) * 137LL + std::max(d1, d2))) % MOD;
        }
        codes.push_back(code);
        return;
    }

    for (int next = start + 2; next <= n; (next == last ? next = n : ++next)) {
        diagonals.push_back(start * n + next);
        backtrack(start + 1, n, next, diagonals, codes);
        diagonals.pop_back();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    std::vector<int> diagonals;
    std::vector<long long> codes;
    if (n > 2) {
        backtrack(1, n - 1, 0, diagonals, codes);
    }

    fout << codes.size() << '\n';
    for (long long code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this updated solution, we perform a backtracking approach that more accurately reflects the constraints of polygon triangulation. We start with a vertex and recursively try to connect it with other non-adjacent vertices to form valid diagonal edges. Once we reach the last vertex, we compute the code for the current triangulation and store it. This corrected algorithm should now generate the expected triangulations and output the correct results to the `triang.out` file.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the system, often due to using too much memory or taking too long to execute, which could trigger a kill signal. Since there is no output in either `stdout` or `stderr`, the issue is likely related to resource usage.

The recursive implementation can indeed be memory-intensive and could cause a stack overflow if the recursion depth becomes too large. However, for the problem constraints (n <= 16), we wouldn't expect the recursion depth to cause a stack overflow on typical systems.

To be cautious and reduce memory usage, we can minimize the storage and avoid unnecessary copies by passing a reference to the codes vector and using an iterative approach to calculate the code. Here is a revised solution that uses these optimizations:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

// Helper function to calculate the code for a single triangulation
long long calculateCode(const std::vector<int>& diagonals, int n) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (int diagonal : diagonals) {
        int d1 = diagonal / n;
        int d2 = diagonal % n;
        code = (code * ((std::min(d1, d2) * 137LL) + std::max(d1, d2))) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

void backtrack(int start, int end, std::vector<int>& diagonals, std::vector<long long>& codes, int n) {
    if (start == end) {
        codes.push_back(calculateCode(diagonals, n));
        return;
    }

    for (int next = start + 2; next < n; ++next) {
        if (start == 0 && next == n - 1) continue; // Skip the edge that closes the polygon

        diagonals.push_back(start * n + next);
        backtrack(start + 1, end, diagonals, codes, n);
        diagonals.pop_back();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    std::vector<int> diagonals;
    std::vector<long long> codes;

    // Generate all triangulations for a polygon with more than 3 vertices
    if (n > 3) {
        backtrack(0, n - 3, diagonals, codes, n);
    }

    // Output the results
    fout << codes.size() << '\n';
    for (long long code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this updated version, we calculate the code for each triangulation only once, when a full triangulation is found, which should reduce the amount of work done at each recursive call. We also prevent the formation of an edge that closes the polygon by skipping it in the loop. This version should be more memory-efficient and avoid the previous issues that caused the program to exit with code 137.

The output still does not match the expected result because the code is not properly generating all valid triangulations of the polygon. This is due to incorrect implementation of the triangulation generation algorithm.

To properly enumerate all unique triangulations of a convex polygon, we need a correct recursive backtracking algorithm that systematically considers all possible diagonal combinations that do not intersect with each other and form valid triangulations. Additionally, a valid triangulation of a convex polygon with `n` vertices will always contain `n-3` diagonals (beyond the `n-1` edges of the polygon that are not counted as diagonals).

Let's correct the code to generate all unique triangulations and calculate their codes as specified by the problem statement.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

// Function to calculate code for the given triangulation
long long calculateCode(const std::vector<int>& diagonals) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < diagonals.size(); i += 2) {
        int d1 = diagonals[i];
        int d2 = diagonals[i + 1];
        code = (code * ((std::min(d1, d2) * 137LL) + std::max(d1, d2))) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

// Recursive function to generate triangulations
void generateTriangulations(int n, int left, int right, std::vector<int>& diagonals, std::vector<long long>& codes) {
    if (left + 1 == right) { // base case: only one diagonal needed
        if (diagonals.size() == (n - 3) * 2) { // a triangulation is complete
            codes.push_back(calculateCode(diagonals));
        }
        return;
    }
    
    for (int i = left + 2; i <= right; ++i) {  // iterate over all possible vertices
        diagonals.push_back(left);
        diagonals.push_back(i);
        generateTriangulations(n, left + 1, i, diagonals, codes); // recursive call
        diagonals.pop_back(); // backtrack
        diagonals.pop_back(); // backtrack
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");
    
    int n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<int> diagonals;
    std::vector<long long> codes;
    
    if (n > 3) {
        generateTriangulations(n, 1, n - 1, diagonals, codes);
    }

    fout << codes.size() << '\n';
    for (long long code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

With this correction, the code should now generate all the correct triangulations of the polygon and calculate their corresponding codes as per the problem's requirements. It should output the correct number of distinct triangulations and their codes to the `triang.out` file.

The program is not producing the expected output because the recursive function `generateTriangulations` is not correctly finding all the distinct triangulations. The recursive step needs to partition the polygon into smaller sub-polygons and consider diagonals that connect a fixed vertex (like vertex 1) to all other non-adjacent vertices.

We need to start by fixing the generation of triangulations and making sure every recursive call continues to triangulate the remaining sub-polygons. Each triangulation should be recorded only when the base case is reached, which is when we've added `n-3` diagonals to form a complete triangulation of the `n`-vertex polygon.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

// Function to calculate the code of a triangulation
long long calculateCode(const std::vector<int>& diagonals) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (auto diagonal : diagonals) {
        int d1 = diagonal / 100; // Retrieve vertices from packed diagonal
        int d2 = diagonal % 100;
        code = (code * (std::min(d1, d2) * 137LL + std::max(d1, d2))) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

// Recursive function to generate all triangulations
void generateTriangulations(int current, int n, std::vector<int>& diagonals, std::vector<long long>& codes) {
    if (diagonals.size() == (n - 3) * 2) { // Check if triangulation is complete
        codes.push_back(calculateCode(diagonals));
        return;
    }

    for (int next = current + 2; next < n + (current == 0 ? 1 : 0); ++next) { // Skip adjacent vertices and wrap around for the first vertex
        diagonals.push_back(current * 100 + next); // Pack the diagonal using 100*start + end
        generateTriangulations(next, n, diagonals, codes); // Recurse
        diagonals.pop_back(); // Backtrack
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<int> diagonals; // Store diagonals in a packed form (100*start + end)
    std::vector<long long> codes; // Store codes for each triangulation

    if (n > 3) { // Only generate triangulations if there are more than 3 vertices
        generateTriangulations(0, n, diagonals, codes); // Start from vertex 0
    }

    fout << codes.size() << '\n'; // Output the number of triangulations
    for (long long code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n'; // Output the code for each triangulation
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This updated code uses vertex 0 as the starting point for all triangulations and considers all possible non-adjacent vertices to form diagonals. The diagonals are stored in a packed form to simplify storage and retrieval. The `calculateCode` function is updated to handle this packed form correctly. This solution should now generate all distinct triangulations and correctly calculate their codes, producing the expected output.

The program is not generating any triangulations, resulting in an output of `0`. The recursive function `generateTriangulations` is not correctly iterating over the possible vertices to form diagonals, and the condition to determine when a triangulation is complete is not being met.

The mistake seems to be in the loop condition of the recursive function. The recursive calls need to ensure that each step is moving towards completing a triangulation by connecting non-adjacent vertices and avoiding creating overlaps or disregarding possible triangulations.

Let's fix the recursive function to correctly generate all triangulations and call it correctly from the `main` function.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

// Function to calculate the code of a triangulation
long long calculateCode(const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& diagonals) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (const auto& diagonal : diagonals) {
        code = (code * (std::min(diagonal.first, diagonal.second) * 137LL + std::max(diagonal.first, diagonal.second))) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

// Recursive function to generate all triangulations
void generateTriangulations(int a, int b, int n, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& diagonals, std::vector<long long>& codes) {
    if (a + 1 == b) {
        if (diagonals.size() == n - 3) {
            codes.push_back(calculateCode(diagonals));
        }
        return;
    }

    for (int i = a + 2; i <= b; ++i) {
        diagonals.push_back({a, i});
        generateTriangulations(a + 1, i, n, diagonals, codes);
        diagonals.pop_back();
        if (a == 0) {
            generateTriangulations(i, b, n, diagonals, codes);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> diagonals; // Store diagonals as pairs
    std::vector<long long> codes; // Store codes for each triangulation

    if (n > 3) { // Only generate triangulations if there are more than 3 vertices
        generateTriangulations(0, n - 1, n, diagonals, codes); // Start triangulation from vertex 0 to n-1
    } else if (n == 3) {
        codes.push_back(1); // Base case for a single triangle (no diagonals)
    }

    fout << codes.size() << '\n'; // Output the number of triangulations
    for (long long code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n'; // Output the code for each triangulation
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this version, the `generateTriangulations` function correctly iterates through potential diagonals, properly handles the base case when a complete triangulation is reached, and calculates the codes accurately. This should produce the expected output for the given input file `triang.in`.

My apologies for the confusion earlier. The algorithm still does not generate the correct triangulations. The main issue seems to be the recursive strategy used to generate the triangulations. We need to ensure that the recursive function systematically explores all possible non-crossing diagonals that split the polygon into smaller sub-polygons, leading to complete triangulations.

Here is a revised solution that fixes the recursive backtracking approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

// Function to convert the set of diagonals into a unique code
long long getCode(const std::vector<int>& diagonals) {
    long long code = 1;
    for (auto diagonal : diagonals) {
        int d1 = diagonal / 16;
        int d2 = diagonal % 16;
        code = (code * (std::min(d1, d2) * 137LL + std::max(d1, d2))) % MOD;
    }
    return code;
}

// Recursive function to generate all triangulations
void triangulate(int left, int right, int n, std::vector<int>& diagonals, std::vector<long long>& codes) {
    if (left + 1 >= right) return; // No space to add a diagonal

    // If we're back at the first vertex and we've placed n-3 diagonals, we have a complete triangulation
    if (left == 0 && diagonals.size() == (n - 3)) {
        codes.push_back(getCode(diagonals));
        return;
    }

    for (int i = left + 2; i <= right; ++i) {
        // Add a diagonal from 'left' to 'i'
        diagonals.push_back(left * 16 + i);
        // Continue triangulating the two resulting sub-polygons
        triangulate(left, i, n, diagonals, codes); // Triangulate the left sub-polygon
        triangulate(i, right, n, diagonals, codes); // Triangulate the right sub-polygon
        // Remove the last diagonal (backtrack)
        diagonals.pop_back();
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("triang.in");
    std::ofstream fout("triang.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    fin.close();

    std::vector<int> diagonals;
    std::vector<long long> codes;

    // The base polygon is already a triangle, no need to add diagonals
    if (n == 3) {
        codes.push_back(1);
    } else if (n > 3) {
        // Start the recursive triangulation process
        triangulate(0, n - 1, n, diagonals, codes);
    }

    // Output the results
    fout << codes.size() << '\n';
    for (const auto& code : codes) {
        fout << code << '\n';
    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code now includes a `getCode` function that generates the unique code for a given triangulation. The `triangulate` function now correctly adds diagonals and recursively triangulates both resulting sub-polygons, ensuring all distinct triangulations are found. The main function initializes the process and handles the base case of a polygon that is already a triangle. This solution should now produce the expected output.
