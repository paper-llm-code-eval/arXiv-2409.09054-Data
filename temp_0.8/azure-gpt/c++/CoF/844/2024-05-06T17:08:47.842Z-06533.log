_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

---------- assistant ----------

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed by the operating system due to running out of memory or being terminated by a signal like SIGKILL. This can happen in an environment where the process is using too much memory, or if it takes too long to execute and a timeout kills it. Since the output does not provide any information, we need to check for possible infinite loops or memory leaks in the code.

Upon reviewing the code, I don't see any obvious infinite loops or memory leaks. However, the while loop in Task 2 could potentially be problematic if the condition `pinsPerDigit[i] <= K` is never met, which would lead to an infinite loop. But given the constraints (14 <= K <= 100000), at least one digit should always fit within the remaining number of pins, so this seems unlikely to be the cause.

Another potential issue could be the size of the input value for `N`. The code reads `N` as a `long long` and then repeatedly divides by 10 to extract digits. This should be efficient, but there might be a problem with how the input is being read from the file.

To address potential issues, let's add a check to ensure we're correctly exiting the loop when `K` becomes less than the minimum pins required to print any digit (which is 2). We'll also verify that the reading from the file is being done properly.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int pinsPerDigit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("imprimanta.in");
    std::ofstream out("imprimanta.out");
    if (!in.is_open() || !out.is_open()) {
        return 1; // Early exit if files cannot be opened
    }

    long long N; // Assuming N fits within the bounds of a long long
    int K;
    in >> N >> K;
    in.close(); // Close the input file as it's not needed anymore

    // Task 1: Find the largest digit with minimum pins used
    int minPins = 8;
    int digitWithMinPins = 0;
    do {
        int digit = N % 10;
        if (pinsPerDigit[digit] < minPins || (pinsPerDigit[digit] == minPins && digit > digitWithMinPins)) {
            minPins = pinsPerDigit[digit];
            digitWithMinPins = digit;
        }
        N /= 10;
    } while (N > 0);
    out << digitWithMinPins << '\n';

    // Task 2: Build the largest number with exactly K pins
    std::string maxNumber;
    while (K >= 2) { // Ensure we exit loop if K is less than minimum pins to print any digit
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (pinsPerDigit[i] <= K) {
                maxNumber += ('0' + i);
                K -= pinsPerDigit[i];
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    out << maxNumber << '\n';
    out.close(); // Close the output file

    return 0;
}
```

With these changes, the program should handle file operations more safely and ensure that the loops terminate properly. The logic to handle Task 1 and Task 2 remains the same, as it appears to be correct.

Upon re-evaluating the result, the issue lies in the logic that builds the largest number with exactly `K` pins. The current code doesn't account for the fact that while constructing the number, we should prioritize using fewer pins to print higher-valued digits first, and then use the remaining pins to print as many '7's as possible (since '7' requires the least number of pins among the highest digits). A greedy algorithm should be employed here to ensure we can maximize the digit values with the given number of pins.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int pinsPerDigit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("imprimanta.in");
    std::ofstream out("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    in >> N >> K;
    in.close();

    // Task 1: Find the largest digit with minimum pins used
    int minPins = 8; // Initialize to a value greater than any digit's pin requirement
    int digitWithMinPins = 0;
    while (N > 0) {
        int digit = N % 10;
        if (pinsPerDigit[digit] < minPins || (pinsPerDigit[digit] == minPins && digit > digitWithMinPins)) {
            minPins = pinsPerDigit[digit];
            digitWithMinPins = digit;
        }
        N /= 10;
    }
    out << digitWithMinPins << '\n';

    // Task 2: Build the largest number with exactly K pins
    // Find out how many '7's we can print with K pins, as '7' requires the least pins (3)
    int count7 = K / 3;
    K %= 3; // Remainder after printing '7's

    // Use remaining pins to print the highest possible digit (if any)
    int highestDigit = 0;
    if (K > 0) {
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (pinsPerDigit[i] == count7 * 3 + K) {
                highestDigit = i;
                count7--; // Adjust the count for '7's as we've used some pins for the highest digit
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the highest digit if found
    if (highestDigit > 0) {
        out << highestDigit;
    }

    // Output the '7's
    while (count7--) {
        out << '7';
    }
    out << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```
With this new approach, we first calculate how many '7's we can print using the available `K` pins. Then, we check if we can use the remaining pins (if any) to print a higher digit. We continue to print '7's until we run out of pins. This method ensures we construct the highest possible number using exactly `K` pins.

The issue with the previous implementation for Task 2 is that it attempted to print as many '7's as possible, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to use the available pins to print the largest possible digits, starting from '9' down to '0', using the number of pins that each digit requires. This time, I will ensure to correct the logic so that the total number of pins used is exactly `K` by prioritizing the larger digits and then filling the rest with '7's if possible.

Let's rewrite the solution for Task 2:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

const int pinsPerDigit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("imprimanta.in");
    std::ofstream out("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    in >> N >> K;
    in.close();

    // Task 1: Find the largest digit with minimum pins used
    int minPins = 8; // Initialize to a value greater than any digit's pin requirement
    int digitWithMinPins = 0;
    while (N > 0) {
        int digit = N % 10;
        if (pinsPerDigit[digit] < minPins || (pinsPerDigit[digit] == minPins && digit > digitWithMinPins)) {
            minPins = pinsPerDigit[digit];
            digitWithMinPins = digit;
        }
        N /= 10;
    }
    out << digitWithMinPins << '\n';

    // Task 2: Build the largest number with exactly K pins
    std::string maxNumber;
    while (K >= 2) { // As long as we have at least 2 pins (the smallest non-zero digit)
        // Find the largest digit that we can print with the remaining pins
        bool found = false;
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (pinsPerDigit[i] <= K) {
                maxNumber += ('0' + i);
                K -= pinsPerDigit[i];
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        // If we cannot find a digit to print with the remaining pins, we break the loop
        if (!found) {
            break;
        }
    }
    out << maxNumber << '\n';
    out.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution starts by finding the largest digit that can be printed with the remaining pins and appends it to the `maxNumber`. This process is repeated until there are not enough pins to print any digit other than '0', which is not printed. This ensures that the largest possible number is constructed using exactly `K` pins.

The issue with the previous implementations for Task 2 is that they did not properly construct the largest number using exactly `K` pins. The logic should be to use as many of the largest digits as possible, and when the remaining pins are not enough to print another '9', it should try to print the next largest possible digit, which requires fewer pins. In the given example, after printing '9' once, we are left with 7 pins, which is not enough for another '9', but it's enough for a '7' and a '4', hence the largest number we can print is '74'.

The solution needs to be adjusted to check each digit starting from the largest (9) to the smallest (1) and using the appropriate number of pins for each, while also considering the distribution of the remaining pins so that we don't miss the opportunity to print larger digits with them. 

Here's the revised solution that should give the correct output:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Define the number of pins for each digit
const int pinsPerDigit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6}; // Number of pins to print each digit

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("imprimanta.in");
    std::ofstream out("imprimanta.out");
    
    long long N; // Number to be printed
    int K;       // Number of pins available
    in >> N >> K;
    in.close(); // Close the input file after reading the data

    // Task 1: Find the largest digit with minimum pins used
    int minPins = 8; // Initialize to a value greater than any digit's pin requirement
    int digitWithMinPins = 0;
    long long tempN = N; // Temporary variable to store the number N
    while (tempN > 0) {
        int digit = tempN % 10;
        if (pinsPerDigit[digit] < minPins || (pinsPerDigit[digit] == minPins && digit > digitWithMinPins)) {
            minPins = pinsPerDigit[digit];
            digitWithMinPins = digit;
        }
        tempN /= 10;
    }
    out << digitWithMinPins << '\n';

    // Task 2: Build the largest number with exactly K pins
    std::string maxNumber;
    while (K >= pinsPerDigit[1]) { // As long as we have at least 2 pins (minimum to print '1')
        int digitToAdd = 0;
        // Find the largest digit that can be printed with the remaining pins K
        for (int digit = 9; digit > 0; --digit) {
            if (pinsPerDigit[digit] <= K) {
                K -= pinsPerDigit[digit]; // Reduce the number of available pins
                digitToAdd = digit;       // Set the digit to be added to the number
                break; // Break once we find the largest digit we can print
            }
        }
        maxNumber += std::to_string(digitToAdd); // Append the digit to the number
    }

    out << maxNumber << '\n';
    out.close(); // Close the output file after writing the data

    return 0;
}
```

This code now correctly finds the largest digits that can be printed with the given number of pins (`K`) starting from '9' and decreasing to '1', ensuring that we always print the largest number possible with exactly `K` pins.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results for Task 2 is due to an incorrect greedy approach. The algorithm should not simply print the largest digit possible until the pins run out. Instead, it should ensure that each addition of a digit yields the largest possible number that can be formed with the remaining pins.

Let's correct the approach for Task 2 by using a more nuanced strategy:

1. Start by attempting to use the largest digit ‘9’. If we have enough pins for a '9', check if the remaining pins can be used to print another digit. If not, try the next largest digit. Continue this process until we find a digit that leaves us with enough pins to print another digit, or we have no pins left.
2. After printing a digit, if we don't have enough pins to print another '9', we should again check for the largest possible digit that can be printed with the remaining pins.
3. Repeat the process until we have printed as many digits as possible with the given number of pins.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int pinsPerDigit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6}; // Pin count for digits 0-9

    std::ofstream out("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    in >> N >> K;
    in.close();

    // Task 1: Find the largest digit with minimum pin usage
    int minPins = 8; // More than the maximum pins any digit requires
    int digitWithMinPins = 0;
    long long number = N;
    while (number > 0) {
        int digit = number % 10;
        if (pinsPerDigit[digit] < minPins || (pinsPerDigit[digit] == minPins && digit > digitWithMinPins)) {
            minPins = pinsPerDigit[digit];
            digitWithMinPins = digit;
        }
        number /= 10;
    }
    out << digitWithMinPins << '\n';

    // Task 2: Build the largest number with exactly K pins
    std::vector<int> maxNumber; // Holds the digits of the largest number

    // Use a greedy approach to construct the largest number possible with K pins
    while (K >= pinsPerDigit[1]) { // Continue until we can't even print '1'
        for (int digit = 9; digit >= 0; --digit) {
            // Check if we can print this digit with the remaining pins
            if (pinsPerDigit[digit] <= K) {
                // Now check if after printing this digit, we will have enough pins to print another digit
                int remainingPins = K - pinsPerDigit[digit];
                bool canPrintMore = false;
                for (int nextDigit = 0; nextDigit <= 9; ++nextDigit) {
                    if (pinsPerDigit[nextDigit] <= remainingPins) {
                        canPrintMore = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                // If we can't print more after this, try a smaller digit
                if (!canPrintMore && digit > 0) continue;
                
                // We can print this digit and potentially more, so add it to our number
                maxNumber.push_back(digit);
                K -= pinsPerDigit[digit]; // Subtract the pins used for this digit
                break; // Break out of the loop to try printing the next digit
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the constructed number to the output
    for (int digit : maxNumber) {
        out << digit;
    }
    out << '\n';

    out.close(); // Close the output file

    return 0;
}
```

This solution will now correctly construct the largest number by ensuring that each selected digit allows for the printing of additional digits and makes the most of the remaining pins. This adjusted algorithm should give the expected output.

Exit code 137 typically indicates an out-of-memory error or that the process was forcibly killed, often due to a timeout. Since there is no direct indication in the standard output or standard error that points to an infinite loop or excessive memory usage, the error may lie elsewhere.

However, in environments with constrained resources or strict execution time limits, it could be that the inner loop in the Task 2 solution is causing the process to take too much time. This inner loop iterates through all digits to check if printing a digit will allow for another digit to be printed with the remaining pins. This is a significant amount of work that is repeated multiple times, which might be causing the timeout and subsequent killing of the process.

To address this, the solution should be optimized to reduce the computational complexity. We can maintain a lookup table for the smallest number of pins needed to print a digit (which is 2 for digit '1') and use it to verify the condition instead of using the inner loop.

Here's the revised solution that optimizes the Task 2 loop:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int pinsPerDigit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6}; // Pin count for digits 0-9
const int minPinsToPrintAnyDigit = 2; // The minimum pins required to print a non-zero digit

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("imprimanta.in");
    std::ofstream out("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    in >> N >> K;
    in.close();

    // Task 1: Find the largest digit with minimum pin usage
    int minPins = 8;
    int digitWithMinPins = 0;
    while (N > 0) {
        int digit = N % 10;
        if (pinsPerDigit[digit] < minPins || (pinsPerDigit[digit] == minPins && digit > digitWithMinPins)) {

    out << digitWithMinPins << '\n';

    // Task 2: Build the largest number with exactly K pins
    std::vector<int> maxNumberDigits; // Holds the digits of the largest number
    while (K >= minPinsToPrintAnyDigit) {
        for (int digit = 9; digit >= 0; --digit) {
            // If we can print the digit and still have pins left for at least another '1'
            if (pinsPerDigit[digit] <= K && (K - pinsPerDigit[digit]) >= minPinsToPrintAnyDigit) {
                maxNumberDigits.push_back(digit);
                K -= pinsPerDigit[digit];
                break;
            }
        }
        // If we can't print more even a '1' then break out of the loop
        if (maxNumberDigits.empty()) break;
    }

    // Write the constructed number to the output
    for (int digit : maxNumberDigits) {
        out << digit;
    }
    if (maxNumberDigits.empty()) {
        // If no number could be constructed, write '0'
        out << '0';
    }
    out << '\n';

    out.close(); // Close the output file

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should avoid the process being terminated due to timeout by optimizing the loop that was potentially causing the problem.
