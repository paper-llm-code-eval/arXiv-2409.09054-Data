_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system due to running out of memory or being killed by a signal (such as SIGKILL, which is often sent by commands like "kill -9" on Unix-like systems). In the context of the original code, this could be due to an infinite loop or excessive memory consumption. However, without standard output or standard error providing specific information about a runtime error, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue.

In the given code above, there's a potential for an infinite loop in max_number_with_k_points() if the condition `K - needle_activations[i]` never becomes negative, meaning K would never decrease to 0 or less. This would happen if K is not large enough to be subtracted by any of the needle_activations values.

To fix the program, we should ensure that there is a condition to break out of the loop if it's not possible to subtract any more needle activations from K. Additionally, we should ensure that we're not creating excessively large strings that could be causing memory issues.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to find the maximum digit with minimum grid needle activation
char max_digit_with_min_activation(const string& num) {
    // Number of needle activations for each digit from 0 to 9
    const int needle_activations[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};
    int min_activation = 8; // Maximum possible activation count is 7
    char result_digit = '0';

    for (char digit : num) {
        int digit_val = digit - '0';
        if (needle_activations[digit_val] < min_activation) {
            min_activation = needle_activations[digit_val];
            result_digit = digit;
        } else if (needle_activations[digit_val] == min_activation && digit > result_digit) {
            // If the current digit has the same activation count but is larger, choose it
            result_digit = digit;
        }
    }

    return result_digit;
}

// Function to find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
string max_number_with_k_points(int K) {
    const int needle_activations[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};
    string result = "";
    // Start with the largest digit '9' to maximize the number
    for (int i = 9; i >= 0 && K > 0; --i) {
        while (K >= needle_activations[i]) {
            result.push_back('0' + i);
            K -= needle_activations[i];
        }
    }
    // The result is already in non-increasing order
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream fout("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    fin >> N >> K;

    string N_str = to_string(N);

    // Find the max digit with min grid needle activation
    char max_digit = max_digit_with_min_activation(N_str);
    fout << max_digit << endl;

    // Find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string max_number = max_number_with_k_points(K);
    fout << max_number << endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this revised solution, `max_digit_with_min_activation` now correctly identifies the largest digit with the minimum activation count, and `max_number_with_k_points` now correctly terminates once it can no longer subtract any activation values from K. Additionally, the program should not experience memory issues as the strings created are proportional to the input size K and not excessively large.

The issue with the found output is in the function `max_number_with_k_points`. Although it correctly finds digits that can be printed within the remaining ink limit (K), it does not ensure that the final number is the largest possible as required by the problem statement. Specifically, after using the largest digits (such as '9's), it should use the next largest possible digit ('7') to ensure the resulting number is the largest possible when sorted.

The algorithm needs to be adjusted to prioritize the digit '7' after '9' because '7' requires the fewest points (3) among the digits that aren't '1'. Using '7' and '1' maximizes the value of the number that can be printed.

Let's fix the `max_number_with_k_points` function:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int needle_activations[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the maximum digit with minimum grid needle activation
char max_digit_with_min_activation(const string& num) {
    int min_activation = 8; // Maximum possible is 7
    char result_digit = '0';

    for (char digit : num) {
        int digit_val = digit - '0';
        if (needle_activations[digit_val] < min_activation ||
            (needle_activations[digit_val] == min_activation && digit > result_digit)) {
            min_activation = needle_activations[digit_val];
            result_digit = digit;
        }
    }

    return result_digit;
}

// Function to find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
string max_number_with_k_points(int K) {
    string result;

    // Use as many '7's as possible after '9's to maximize the number
    while (K >= needle_activations[7]) {
        result.push_back('7');
        K -= needle_activations[7];
    }

    // Use '1' if that's all that's left for ink
    while (K >= needle_activations[1]) {
        result.push_back('1');
        K -= needle_activations[1];
    }

    // No more digits can be printed if K < needle_activations[1]
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream fout("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    fin.close();

    string N_str = to_string(N);

    // Find the max digit with min grid needle activation
    char max_digit = max_digit_with_min_activation(N_str);
    fout << max_digit << endl;

    // Find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string max_number = max_number_with_k_points(K);
    fout << max_number << endl;

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this revised solution, `max_number_with_k_points` now correctly prioritizes '7' after '9', and then fills the remaining points with '1'. This ensures that the resulting number is the largest possible given the constraint of printing exactly K points. The correctness of the function `max_digit_with_min_activation` remains unchanged from the previous solution.

Upon reviewing the expected output and the incorrect output produced by the revised solution, the issue becomes evident. The output "77777" is incorrect because my previous solution was trying to maximize the number of digits rather than the value of the number. The correct approach is to use the highest digit that fits into the remaining K points.

For the second part of the task, we need to print the largest possible number using exactly K points. We can do this by using as many '9's as possible (since '9' takes 6 points and is the highest digit), and then use '7' if we have exactly 3 points left, or '1' if we have 2 points left (since '1' takes 2 points and is the lowest digit). It is not possible to use any digit if we have only 1 point left.

Let's rewrite the `max_number_with_k_points` function correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int needle_activations[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the maximum digit with minimum grid needle activation
char max_digit_with_min_activation(const string& num) {
    int min_activation = 8; // More than the maximum possible activation count (7)
    char result_digit = '0';

    for (char digit : num) {
        int digit_val = digit - '0';
        if (needle_activations[digit_val] < min_activation ||
            (needle_activations[digit_val] == min_activation && digit > result_digit)) {
            min_activation = needle_activations[digit_val];
            result_digit = digit;
        }
    }

    return result_digit;
}

// Function to find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
string max_number_with_k_points(int K) {
    string result;

    // Use as many '9's as possible to maximize the value
    while (K >= needle_activations[9]) {
        result.push_back('9');
        K -= needle_activations[9];
    }

    // Use '7' if we have exactly 3 points left
    if (K == needle_activations[7]) {
        result.push_back('7');
        K -= needle_activations[7];
    }

    // Use '1' if we have exactly 2 points left
    if (K == needle_activations[1]) {
        result.push_back('1');
        K -= needle_activations[1];
    }

    // No more digits can be printed if K < needle_activations[1]
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream fout("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    fin.close();

    string N_str = to_string(N);

    // Find the max digit with min grid needle activation
    char max_digit = max_digit_with_min_activation(N_str);
    fout << max_digit << endl;

    // Find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string max_number = max_number_with_k_points(K);
    fout << max_number << endl;

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised solution should now produce the correct output, as it correctly uses '9's to maximize value and uses '7' or '1' if there are a few points left. The function `max_digit_with_min_activation` remains correct as it finds the largest digit with the minimum needle activation count.

The issue with the previous program is that it does not correctly determine the largest possible number that can be printed with exactly K points. It simply uses the highest value digit ('9') until it cannot anymore, and then tries to use a '7' or '1' if the remaining points allow. The problem with this approach is that it does not consider that using a combination of '8's and '7's might give a larger number than just '9's.

To fix this, we need to iterate over the number of '8's we can use, then use a '7' if possible, and fill the rest with '9's. We need to find the right combination of '8's, '7's, and '9's that allows us to use exactly K points and results in the largest possible number. We can try using an '8' first, then use '7's if there are three points left, otherwise, we fill the rest with '9's.

Let's implement the correct `max_number_with_k_points` function:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Activations needed for each digit 0-9
int activations[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the maximum digit with minimum grid needle activation
char max_digit_with_min_activation(const string& num) {
    int min_activation = 8; // Set to a number higher than any activations
    char max_digit = '0';
    for (char digit : num) {
        int current_activation = activations[digit - '0'];
        if (current_activation < min_activation || (current_activation == min_activation && digit > max_digit)) {
            min_activation = current_activation;
            max_digit = digit;
        }
    }
    return max_digit;
}

// Function to find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
string max_number_with_k_points(int K) {
    string result = "";

    // Try using '8' first, which is the highest digit that requires 7 points
    while (K >= activations[8]) {
        result += '8';
        K -= activations[8];
    }

    // If there are 3 points left, use '7'
    if (K == activations[7]) {
        result += '7';
        K -= activations[7];
    }

    // If there are 2 points left, use '1'
    else if (K == activations[1]) {
        result += '1';
        K -= activations[1];
    }

    // If there are still points left, replace the last '8' with '9' if possible
    if (!result.empty() && K == activations[9] - activations[8]) {
        result.back() = '9';
        K -= (activations[9] - activations[8]);
    }

    // If we cannot print any more digits, return the current result
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream fout("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    fin.close();

    string N_str = to_string(N);

    // Find the max digit with min grid needle activation
    char max_digit = max_digit_with_min_activation(N_str);
    fout << max_digit << endl;

    // Find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string max_number = max_number_with_k_points(K);
    fout << max_number << endl;

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected solution, `max_number_with_k_points` now tries to use '8' first, then '7' if 3 points are left, or '1' if 2 points are left. If still there are points left, which is enough to replace the last '8' with a '9', it does so. This way, we ensure that we're using the points to create the largest possible number that can be printed with exactly K points. The `max_digit_with_min_activation` function correctly finds the largest digit with the minimum activation.

The previous program produced an incorrect result because it did not properly account for the strategy to maximize the printed number using exactly K points. To form the largest number possible with K points, we must first use as many '9's as possible since '9' has the highest value for the digits. Then, we should use one '8' if we have 7 points remaining or one '7' if we have 3 points remaining. Lastly, if we have 2 points remaining, we should use one '1'. The algorithm should not start with '8's; instead, it must prioritize '9's to ensure the largest possible number.

Let's correct the `max_number_with_k_points` function:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int activations[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the maximum digit with minimum grid needle activation
char max_digit_with_min_activation(const string& num) {
    int min_activation = 8; // More than the maximum possible activation count (7)
    char result_digit = '9';  // Initializing to the maximum digit

    for (char digit : num) {
        int digit_val = digit - '0';
        if (activations[digit_val] < min_activation ||
            (activations[digit_val] == min_activation && digit > result_digit)) {
            min_activation = activations[digit_val];
            result_digit = digit;
        }
    }

    return result_digit;
}

// Function to find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
string max_number_with_k_points(int K) {
    string result;

    // Use as many '9's as possible to maximize the number
    while (K >= activations[9]) {
        result.push_back('9');
        K -= activations[9];
    }

    // If we have 7 points left, use an '8'
    if (K == activations[8]) {
        result.push_back('8');
        K -= activations[8];
    }

    // If we have 3 points left, use a '7'
    else if (K == activations[7]) {
        result.push_back('7');
        K -= activations[7];
    }

    // If we have 2 points left, use a '1'
    else if (K == activations[1]) {
        result.push_back('1');
        K -= activations[1];
    }

    // The order is already correct (from largest to smallest)
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream fout("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    fin.close();

    string N_str = to_string(N);

    // Find the max digit with min grid needle activation
    char max_digit = max_digit_with_min_activation(N_str);
    fout << max_digit << '\n';

    // Find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string max_number = max_number_with_k_points(K);
    fout << max_number << '\n';

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This solution now correctly uses '9's to maximize the value of the number printed. Then, it checks if exactly one '8', '7', or '1' can be used with the remaining points. This should produce the expected output, which is the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points.

Upon careful analysis, the mistake is in the `max_number_with_k_points` function. While the function uses '9's as much as possible, it fails to utilize the remaining points optimally when there is not enough ink for a '9'. The issue is that when fewer than 6 points remain, the function should consider using a '7' if there are exactly 3 points left, but if there are more than 3 points left, it should use '8's and then a '7' if possible.

The correct algorithm for the second part should build the largest possible number by using digits that require more points first, and when not enough points are left to use a '9', it should use '8's (7 points) until it can no longer do so and then use a '7' if 3 points are left, or '1's if 2 points are left.

Here is the corrected code implementing the revised algorithm:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int activations[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the maximum digit with minimum grid needle activation
int max_digit_with_min_activation(long long N) {
    int min_activation = 8; // Set to a number higher than any activations
    int max_digit = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each digit in N to find the one with minimum activation
    while (N > 0) {
        int digit = N % 10;
        if (activations[digit] < min_activation) {
            min_activation = activations[digit];
            max_digit = digit;
        } else if (activations[digit] == min_activation && digit > max_digit) {
            max_digit = digit;
        }
        N /= 10;
    }

    return max_digit;
}

// Function to find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
string max_number_with_k_points(int K) {
    string result;

    // Use '9's as much as possible
    while (K >= activations[9]) {
        result.push_back('9');
        K -= activations[9];
    }

    // If we have enough ink for an '8', use it once
    if (K >= activations[8]) {
        result.push_back('8');
        K -= activations[8];
    }

    // Then, use '7' if we have 3 points left or '1' if we have 2 points left
    while (K >= activations[1]) {
        result.push_back(K >= activations[7] ? '7' : '1');
        K -= (K >= activations[7] ? activations[7] : activations[1]);
    }

    // The result is a string with digits in descending order
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream fout("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    fin.close();

    // Find the max digit with min grid needle activation
    int max_digit = max_digit_with_min_activation(N);
    fout << max_digit << '\n';

    // Find the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string max_number = max_number_with_k_points(K);
    fout << max_number << '\n';

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Now, the `max_number_with_k_points` function first uses as many '9's as possible. If not enough points remain for another '9', it uses one '8' if there are enough points, and then uses a '7' if there are 3 points left or '1' if there are 2 points left. This guarantees producing the largest number possible with exactly K points. The `max_digit_with_min_activation` function has also been updated to work directly with the integer N, avoiding the conversion to a string. This should now produce the expected output.
