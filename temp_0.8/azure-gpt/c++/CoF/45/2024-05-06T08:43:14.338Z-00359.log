Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

This code should provide a fast and correct solution to the given challenge. It uses depth-first search (DFS) to compute the number of ways to distribute carrots to the rabbits based on their hierarchy and the problem's constraints. It stores the results modulo 30011 to keep the numbers manageable. 

Please note that the code assumes that the boss rabbit's number is 7, according to the example. In a more general case, you would need to determine the root of the hierarchy, which will be the rabbit that is not a child of any other rabbits.

I apologize for the oversight. The code I provided assumes that the boss rabbit's number is 7 based on the example, but we should not hard-code this as the root can be any rabbit that is not a subordinate of anyone else. Also, we need to use dynamic programming to compute the ways for each node correctly. Let's fix the code with an approach that does not make assumptions about the root and computes the result correctly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> children[101]; // Children list for each rabbit
int dp[101][102]; // Dynamic programming table
int N, K;

void dfs(int node) {
    // Initialize the DP table with base case: 1 way to give 1 to K carrots
    for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
        dp[node][i] = 1;
    }

    // Loop through all children and solve subproblems
    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        // Update the DP table for the current node based on its children
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= K + 1; ++j) {
                sum += dp[child][j];
                sum %= MOD;
            }
            dp[node][i] = (dp[node][i] * sum) % MOD;
        }
    }

    // Accumulate the total number of ways including the case when the node eats 0 carrots
    for (int i = K; i >= 0; --i) {
        dp[node][i] += dp[node][i + 1];
        dp[node][i] %= MOD;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    // An array to keep track of which rabbits have a boss
    bool has_boss[N + 1] = {false};

    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        has_boss[b] = true;
    }

    // Find the rabbit without a boss - the root of the hierarchy
    int root = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_boss[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Solve the problem using DFS and dynamic programming
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    dfs(root);

    // Since we have accumulated the total number in dp[root][0] including 0 carrots case
    // We subtract the count for 0 carrots to get the final answer
    int result = (dp[root][0] - dp[root][1] + MOD) % MOD;

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```
This corrected version of the code should now correctly handle the input and compute the number of ways to distribute the carrots following the hierarchy rules. It uses depth-first search to traverse the tree and dynamic programming to calculate the number of distributions, taking care to consider the 0 carrots case for the final result.

I apologize for the error. Let's correct the issue and provide a new solution. This time, we need to carefully reevaluate the approach to ensure the correct number of ways is calculated. The main idea is to use dynamic programming to count the ways in which we can assign carrots to each rabbit, making sure that a rabbit always eats at least one carrot less than its subordinates.

Here's a new, corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 30011;

int N, K, dp[101][101], temp[101];
vector<int> graph[101];

void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1; // Base case: if no carrots are to be given, there is 1 way (do nothing)
    
    for (int child : graph[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        // Start with the assumption of giving 0 carrots to the current node
        fill(temp, temp + K + 1, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) { // Carrots for the current node
            for (int j = 1; j <= K - i; ++j) { // Carrots for the child, ensure at least one more carrot for the child
                temp[i] += dp[child][j] * dp[node][i]; // Multiply the ways for the child and current node
                temp[i] %= MOD;
            }
        }

        copy(temp, temp + K + 1, dp[node]);
    }

    // Now dp[node] contains the number of ways to distribute carrots to the subtree rooted at 'node'
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;

    // Rilă Iepurilă, the boss, has no parent
    int boss = 0;
    vector<int> has_parent(N + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        graph[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = 1;
    }
    
    fin.close();

    // Find Rilă Iepurilă (the boss rabbit)
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
        if (!has_parent[i])
            boss = i;

    // Run DFS starting from the boss
    dfs(boss);

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result += dp[boss][i];
        result %= MOD;
    }

    fout << result << endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code should now calculate the number of ways to distribute the carrots correctly. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the hierarchy tree. At each node, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots considering that each rabbit must eat at least one carrot less than any of its subordinates. We identify the boss as the rabbit without a parent and start the DFS from there. The result is the sum of ways for the boss to eat from 1 to K carrots.

It looks like there are still issues with the dynamic programming approach I've been using. The correct approach should involve computing the number of ways to distribute carrots from the bottom up, while ensuring that each rabbit gets at least one less than any of its subordinates. The computation for each node should depend on the possibilities for its children, taking into account the restriction on the number of carrots each can have.

Let's try to fix the dynamic programming approach.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAXN = 101;
const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> subordinates[MAXN];
int dp[MAXN][MAXN]; // dp[i][j] will store the number of ways to distribute j carrots among the sub-tree of rabbit i

void compute(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1; // Base case: for 0 carrots, there is 1 way (no carrots)
    for (int subordinate : subordinates[node]) {
        compute(subordinate);
        // Temporary array to hold new values after combining with subordinate
        int temp[MAXN] = {0};
        for (int i = 0; dp[node][i] != 0; i++) { // For each possible carrot count for the current node
            for (int j = 1; j <= K; j++) { // For each possible carrot count for the subordinate
                temp[i + j] += dp[node][i] * dp[subordinate][j];
                temp[i + j] %= MOD;
            }
        }
        std::copy(temp, temp + K + 1, dp[node]);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");
    int N, K;

    fin >> N >> K;
    std::vector<bool> has_superior(N + 1, false);

    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        int superior, subordinate;
        fin >> superior >> subordinate;
        subordinates[superior].push_back(subordinate);
        has_superior[subordinate] = true;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Identify the boss (the one without a superior)
    int boss = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (!has_superior[i]) {
            boss = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    compute(boss);

    // Calculate the answer by summing the ways the boss can have 1 to K carrots
    int answer = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; i++) {
        answer += dp[boss][i];
        answer %= MOD;
    }

    fout << answer << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This revised code defines a `compute` function that uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to distribute carrots among rabbits, considering their hierarchical structure. The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to distribute a given number of carrots within a sub-tree of the hierarchy. The result is the number of ways the boss can have between 1 and K carrots. This approach ensures that each rabbit gets at least one less carrot than any of its subordinates by starting the inner loop for carrots at 1 (not 0), thus maintaining the hierarchy condition.

The compiler error messages indicate that the variable `K` was not declared in the scope of the `compute` function. To fix the program, we need to make `K` accessible within the `compute` function. We can do this by declaring `K` as a global variable or passing it as a parameter to the `compute` function. Given that `K` represents a value that is constant throughout the runtime of the program after being read from the input, it is reasonable to choose to make `K` a global variable.

Let's fix the code by declaring `K` as a global variable:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAXN = 101;
const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> subordinates[MAXN];
int dp[MAXN][MAXN]; // dp[i][j] will store the number of ways to distribute j carrots among the sub-tree of rabbit i
int K; // Global variable to hold the maximum number of carrots a rabbit can eat

void compute(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1; // Base case: for 0 carrots, there is 1 way (no carrots)
    for (int subordinate : subordinates[node]) {
        compute(subordinate);
        // Temporary array to hold new values after combining with subordinate
        int temp[MAXN] = {0};
        for (int i = 0; dp[node][i] != 0; i++) { // For each possible carrot count for the current node
            for (int j = 1; j <= K; j++) { // For each possible carrot count for the subordinate
                temp[i + j] += dp[node][i] * dp[subordinate][j];
                temp[i + j] %= MOD;
            }
        }
        std::copy(temp, temp + K + 1, dp[node]);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");
    int N;

    fin >> N >> K;
    std::vector<bool> has_superior(N + 1, false);

    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        int superior, subordinate;
        fin >> superior >> subordinate;
        subordinates[superior].push_back(subordinate);
        has_superior[subordinate] = true;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Identify the boss (the one without a superior)
    int boss = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (!has_superior[i]) {
            boss = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    compute(boss);

    // Calculate the answer by summing the ways the boss can have 1 to K carrots
    int answer = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; i++) {

    }

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This modified code now has the `K` variable declared globally, which should resolve the compilation error. The `compute` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots within the sub-trees of the rabbit hierarchy, and the `main` function sums up the ways for the boss rabbit to get from 1 to `K` carrots.

Let's inspect the code and logic to determine why the results differ from the expected output. First, I will outline a new approach to ensure the algorithm aligns with the problem requirements:

1. As we iterate through each child, we need to use a temporary storage to accumulate the current distribution possibilities without overwriting the parent's distribution, until all children have been considered.

2. The current approach might overwrite the number of ways we can distribute carrots for the current node with the number of ways considering just the last child due to the direct copy operation inside the loop over the children. We should be aggregating the results from all children before updating the parent's distribution.

3. We must ensure that the number of carrots each rabbit gets is less than the number of carrots each of its subordinates receive. This means that when we combine distributions from a parent and child, the child must always receive more carrots than the parent.

Let's correct the code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MAXN = 101;
const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> adj[MAXN];
int dp[MAXN][MAXN], ways[MAXN];
int N, K;

// Calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots to a subtree rooted at `node`
void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1;  // There's 1 way to distribute 0 carrots.

    for (int child : adj[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        memset(ways, 0, sizeof(ways)); // Reset our temporary ways for calculations.

        // Combine the ways with that of the children.
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) { // Carrots for the current node.
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= K; ++j) { // Carrots for the child, at least one more than the current node.
                ways[i] = (ways[i] + dp[node][i] * dp[child][j]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        // Update the dp table with the combined ways.
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
            dp[node][i] = ways[i];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    int root = 0;
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);

    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        adj[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Find the root (Rilă Iepurilă)
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Perform DFS from the root to compute the number of ways
    dfs(root);

    // Sum the number of ways for the root rabbit to eat 1 to K carrots.
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[root][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;

    fout.close();
    return 0;
}

This corrected code should now calculate the correct number of ways to distribute the carrots. The `dfs` function properly combines the distributions of carrots to a node with the distributions of its children by ensuring that each child gets strictly more carrots than the node itself. Then, in the `main` function, we sum up the ways for the root (boss) rabbit to get from 1 to K carrots, ensuring that we follow the hierarchy constraints.

Let's go through the problem statement once again and evaluate the logic.

The rabbits are organized in a hierarchy such that each rabbit has exactly one direct superior (except for the boss rabbit). Each rabbit can eat between 1 and K carrots, and each superior must eat at least one carrot less than each of its subordinates.

The logic for counting the number of ways we can distribute carrots must ensure that these conditions are met. The dynamic programming approach we're using needs to correctly count the ways for the current rabbit based on the ways available for its subordinates. It appears that the previous approach was not properly accounting for the condition that each superior must eat less than each of its subordinates.

Let’s take another approach to solve the problem:

1. We recursively process each node and its subtree to calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots, based on the constraints.
2. Since the boss rabbit does not have a superior, we start with this rabbit and move down the hierarchy.
3. We accumulate the number of ways in which we can distribute carrots to the subordinates such that each subordinate gets at least one more carrot than the current rabbit.
4. The result is the number of ways to distribute carrots to the boss rabbit with 1 to K carrots, respecting the hierarchy.

Here's the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> subordinates[101];
int dp[102][101];  // dp[i][j] stores number of ways rabbit i can distribute j carrots to its subordinates

void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1;  // Base case, no carrots to subordinates
    for (int carrot = 1; carrot < 101; ++carrot) {  // Initialize for self consumption
        dp[node][carrot] = 1;  
    }
    
    for (int subordinate : subordinates[node]) {
        dfs(subordinate);
        
        for (int carrot = 100; carrot >= 0; --carrot) {  // Total carrots for node and its subordinates
            int sum = 0;
            for (int sub_carrot = 1; sub_carrot <= carrot; ++sub_carrot) {  // Carrots for subordinates
                sum += dp[subordinate][sub_carrot];
                sum %= MOD;
            }
            dp[node][carrot] = (dp[node][carrot] * sum) % MOD;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    int N, K;
    fin >> N >> K;

    // Find the boss (the one without a superior)
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);
    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        subordinates[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }
    fin.close();

    int boss = std::find(has_parent.begin() + 1, has_parent.end(), false) - has_parent.begin();

    // Run DFS from the boss
    dfs(boss);

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result += dp[boss][i];
        result %= MOD;
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this updated solution, the `dfs` function is responsible for filling the `dp` array with the number of ways to distribute carrots, considering the hierarchical constraints. The `main` function sums the number of ways for the boss rabbit to receive between 1 and K carrots. This count includes the different ways in which carrots can be distributed to its subordinates while respecting the hierarchical order. We start with the boss rabbit and propagate the possibilities through the hierarchy.
