Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

This code uses depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of ways an individual rabbit can distribute carrots to its subordinates, and then combines these numbers to find the total number of ways. The `dp[node][i]` array represents the number of ways to distribute carrots such that rabbit `node` has `i` subordinates who have eaten more carrots than `node` itself. The final result is calculated by summing the possible distributions of carrots for the root node. The solution does not use `cin`, `cout`, `printf`, or `scanf` and writes the result to `iepuri.out` as requested. The code assumes that there will be one rabbit with no children to identify the root, which isn’t always Rilă Iepurilă, given the example input structure.

The initial solution has an incorrect assumption about finding the root. The root is not the node with no children; it's the node which has no parent. Additionally, the solution doesn't properly take into account the maximum number of carrots (K) that each rabbit can eat. We need to adjust the dynamic programming state to consider this constraint.

To correct these issues, I will rewrite the solution to properly identify the root and ensure the constraint with K is applied.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MOD = 30011;
const int MAXN = 101;

std::vector<int> children[MAXN];
int dp[MAXN][MAXN]; // dp[i][j] will store the number of ways to distribute j carrots to the subtree of node i
int K;

void dfs(int node) {
    // Initialize the dp for the current node with 1 way to distribute 0 carrots
    dp[node][0] = 1;
    // Iterate through all children of the current node
    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);
        // For each possible number of carrots, calculate the dp values considering the current child
        for (int carrots = K; carrots >= 0; --carrots) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int c = 0; c < carrots; ++c) {
                sum = (sum + dp[node][carrots - c - 1] * dp[child][c]) % MOD;
            }
            dp[node][carrots] = sum;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N >> K;

    // Create an array to track the parent of each node
    int parent[MAXN];
    memset(parent, -1, sizeof(parent));

    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        int a, b;
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        parent[b] = a;
    }

    // Find the root (the node without a parent)
    int root = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (parent[i] == -1) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Run DFS starting from the root to fill in the dp table
    dfs(root);

    // The result is the number of ways to distribute K carrots to the root
    int result = dp[root][K];

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The updated solution finds the root by checking which node doesn't have a parent. Then, it properly calculates the dynamic programming states by considering the maximum number of carrots each rabbit can eat (K), and builds up the number of ways carrots can be distributed from the leaf nodes up to the root. The final answer is then the number of ways to distribute K carrots to the entire tree, which is given by `dp[root][K]`. The output is written to `iepuri.out` as required.

The previous solution does not correctly account for the hierarchical carrot distribution requirements. Each rabbit must eat at least one carrot and can eat up to K carrots, but a rabbit must always eat at least one carrot less than any of its subordinates. Let's correct this by updating our dynamic programming approach so that we first calculate for each node the number of ways it can distribute carrots to its subordinates, then use this information to update the possibilities for its parent.

We will use two DP arrays: `dp[node][carrots]`, which represents the number of ways node `node` can distribute `carrots` carrots among its direct subordinates, and `total[node][carrots]`, which will accumulate possibilities considering the constraint of eating at least one carrot less than its children.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MOD = 30011;
const int MAXN = 101;

std::vector<int> children[MAXN];
int dp[MAXN][MAXN]; // Number of ways to distribute carrots to node's subordinates
int total[MAXN];    // Total ways to distribute carrots considering the node itself
int K;

void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1; // There's always 1 way to distribute 0 carrots
    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);
        for (int k = K; k >= 0; --k) { // For each number of carrots available
            int temp = 0;
            for (int c = 0; c <= k; ++c) { // Consider all possible carrot distributions
                temp = (temp + dp[node][k-c] * dp[child][c]) % MOD;
            }
            dp[node][k] = temp;
        }
    }
    // Calculate the total ways considering the node itself
    total[node] = 0;
    for (int c = 1; c <= K; ++c) { // Node itself must eat at least one carrot
        total[node] = (total[node] + dp[node][c-1]) % MOD;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N >> K;

    // Find the root - it's the one with no parent
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N+1, false);
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        int a, b;
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }
    fin.close();

    int root = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Initialize DP arrays
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    memset(total, 0, sizeof(total));

    // Run DFS starting from the root
    dfs(root);

    // The result is the total ways considering the root node
    fout << total[root] << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This corrected solution should now adhere to the hierarchical constraints and produce the expected result. The dynamic programming state `total[node]` is introduced to keep track of the valid distributions for a node, considering it has to eat at least one carrot less than its children.

It seems there was still a misunderstanding in the previous implementation about how to properly distribute the carrots among the rabbits according to the given constraints. The algorithm needs to accommodate the condition that any rabbit must eat at least one carrot less than any of its subordinates. This is a classic problem of counting the number of ways to partition integers and can be solved using dynamic programming.

To fix the solution, we will implement an algorithm that calculates the number of ways each rabbit can be fed with carrots considering the constraints, and then combine these ways for the overall solution.

Let's have another go at writing the solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 30011;

int N, K, ways = 1;
std::vector<int> G[101];
int dp[101];

void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node] = 1; // The node itself can eat in 1 way (1 to K carrots)
    int total_subtree_ways = 1; // Start with 1 way (all subordinates eat 0)

    // Process all children
    for (int& child : G[node]) {
        dfs(child);
        total_subtree_ways = (total_subtree_ways * (dp[child] + 1)) % MOD; // +1 for the case child eats 0
    }

    // Calculate the number of ways the node can eat considering its subordinates
    for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
        dp[node] = (dp[node] * total_subtree_ways) % MOD;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    int x, y, root = 1;
    std::vector<int> degree(N + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        fin >> x >> y;
        degree[y]++;
        G[x].push_back(y);
    }
    fin.close();

    // Find the rabbit that is not a subordinate (i.e., the root)
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (degree[i] == 0) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Run DFS from the root
    dfs(root);

    fout << dp[root] << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, `dp[node]` represents the number of ways the `node` rabbit can distribute carrots to itself and all of its subordinates, under the constraints. We run a DFS from the root, and for each rabbit, we calculate the ways considering all amounts of carrots it can eat (from 1 to K), multiplied by the ways its entire subtree can be fed (including the possibility of zero carrots, which represents the case when the subordinate eats one carrot more than its boss). The `degree` vector is used to find the root, which is the node with no incoming edges (degree zero). The final answer is then the value of `dp[root]`, which we write to `iepuri.out`.

The previous solution attempts to use dynamic programming to calculate the ways to distribute carrots among the rabbits. However, it does not correctly handle the constraint that the number of carrots a rabbit can eat depends on the number eaten by its subordinates. Let's re-implement the solution with a correct dynamic programming approach.

We will approach the problem with a bottom-up dynamic programming technique where we calculate, for each rabbit, the number of ways it can be fed based on the number of ways its subordinates can be fed.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 30011;
const int MAXN = 102;

int N, K, root;
std::vector<int> graph[MAXN];
int dp[MAXN][MAXN]; // dp[i][j] - number of ways to distribute j carrots to rabbit i and its subordinates

// Add the carrot distributions of a subordinate to the current rabbit
void combine(int node, int sub, int max_carrots) {
    for (int i = max_carrots; i >= 0; --i) {
        int new_ways = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            new_ways = (new_ways + dp[node][i - j - 1] * dp[sub][j]) % MOD;
        }
        dp[node][i] = new_ways;
    }
}

void dfs(int node) {
    // A rabbit can eat from 1 to K carrots, initialize with 1 way to eat 1 carrot
    for (int carrots = 1; carrots <= K; ++carrots) {
        dp[node][carrots] = 1;
    }

    // Process all children of the current node
    for (int &sub : graph[node]) {
        dfs(sub);
        combine(node, sub, K);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    std::vector<int> parent(N + 1, 0);
    for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        int a, b;
        fin >> a >> b;
        graph[a].push_back(b);
        parent[b] = a;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Find the root (the one with no parent)
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (parent[i] == 0) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Run DFS from the root to fill the dp array
    dfs(root);

    // The result is the sum of ways the root rabbit can eat carrots considering all of its subordinates
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[root][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we have an adjacency list `graph` representing which rabbit is subordinate to which. We use a depth-first search (DFS) approach starting from the root rabbit. The dp array is used to store the number of ways to distribute a certain number of carrots to a rabbit and its subordinates. We combine the number of ways from the subordinates with that of the current rabbit, ensuring that a rabbit always eats less than its subordinates. After processing the subordinates, we update the dp array for the current rabbit.

The root is found as the one with no parents. The final result is the sum of the ways the root rabbit can eat 1 to K carrots, considering the constraints on its subordinates. We write this sum to the output file `iepuri.out`.

Let's correct the previous solution and ensure that it adheres to the given constraints. To clearly handle the condition that each rabbit has to eat at least one carrot less than its subordinates, we need to adjust the dynamic programming approach. We will calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots bottom-up, from the leaves to the root, while ensuring that each parent eats fewer carrots than its children.

Each rabbit can eat between 1 and K carrots, inclusive, and this range should be considered when distributing carrots among the rabbits. The root can be found by identifying the node with no parent, as in the previous solutions.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> children[101];
int dp[101][101], ways[101];

void dfs(int node) {
    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) { // Carrots for current node
        dp[node][i] = 1; // Base case: one way to give 'i' carrots to the current rabbit
        for (int child : children[node]) { // Multiplying possibilities given to each child
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < i; ++j) { // Carrots for each child must be less than 'i'
                sum = (sum + dp[child][j]) % MOD;
            }
            dp[node][i] = (dp[node][i] * sum) % MOD; // Combine child's possibilities
        }
    }
    // Sum up all the ways to give carrots to the current node
    ways[node] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        ways[node] = (ways[node] + dp[node][i]) % MOD;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    int root = 0; // Will be set to the root node's index
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);
    
    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }
    fin.close();
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i; // Found the root
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root); // Call DFS to calculate the number of ways

    fout << ways[root] << '\n'; // Output the number of ways for the root
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, `dp[node][i]` stores the number of ways to distribute exactly `i` carrots to rabbit `node` and its subordinates, considering that each subordinate must get at least one carrot less than the `node`. We traverse the tree using DFS and calculate the `dp` values bottom-up. The `ways[node]` array sums up the total possibilities for each rabbit to get from 1 to K carrots. The final answer is the value of `ways[root]`.

This corrected solution should now follow the hierarchical feeding constraints and compute the expected output. We write this result to the file `iepuri.out`.

Evaluate the error message. Think of a solution to fix the program and return the entire source code with the fix.

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.
---------- assistant ----------

The errors indicate that the variables `N` and `K` were not declared in the appropriate scope. To fix the program, we will declare these variables globally, just as we did with the `children`, `dp`, and `ways` arrays. Let's correct the code and rewrite the entire solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 30011;

int N, K; // Declare N and K globally
std::vector<int> children[101];
int dp[101][101], ways[101];

void dfs(int node) {
    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) { // Carrots for current node
        dp[node][i] = 1; // Base case: one way to give 'i' carrots to the current rabbit
        for (int child : children[node]) { // Multiplying possibilities given to each child
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < i; ++j) { // Carrots for each child must be less than 'i'
                sum = (sum + dp[child][j]) % MOD;
            }
            dp[node][i] = (dp[node][i] * sum) % MOD; // Combine child's possibilities
        }
    }
    // Sum up all the ways to give carrots to the current node
    ways[node] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        ways[node] = (ways[node] + dp[node][i]) % MOD;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    int root = 0; // Will be set to the root node's index
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);
    
    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }
    fin.close();
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i; // Found the root
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root); // Call DFS to calculate the number of ways

    fout << ways[root] << '\n'; // Output the number of ways for the root
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

By declaring `N` and `K` globally, we ensure that they are accessible within the `dfs` function as well as the `main` function. This should resolve the compilation errors and the program should now compile and run correctly. The output will be written to `iepuri.out` as expected.
