Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

std::vector<int> children[MAXN];
int ways[MAXN][MAXN], dp[MAXN][MAXN], temp[MAXN];

            }
        }

        std::copy(temp, temp + MAXN, ways[node]);  // Copy the result back to ways[node].
    }

    // Calculate dp for the current node.
    for (int i = 0; i < MAXN; i++) {
        dp[node][i + 1] = ways[node][i];  // Each child must eat at least one carrot less.
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    int N, K;
    fin >> N >> K;

    int root;
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        int a, b;
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        root = a;  // We assume the last 'a' to be the root (but we'll check to make sure)
    }

    // Find the true root (Rilă Iepurilă), which is not a child of anyone.
    bool isChild[MAXN] = {false};
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        for (int child : children[i]) {
            isChild[child] = true;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (!isChild[i]) {
            root = i;

        }
    }

    dfs(root);

    // Sum the results for the root node with at most K carrots.
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; i++) {
        result = (result + dp[root][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ solution defines a depth-first search function (`dfs`) that calculates the number of ways iepuri (rabbits) can be assigned carrots in a hierarchical structure. It uses the file `iepuri.in` to read the input and writes the result to the file `iepuri.out`. The solution uses dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach. It first reads in the hierarchy of the iepuri and calculates the number of ways each iepuri can be given carrots with respect to their subordinates. It then sums the possibilities for the root iepure (Rilă Iepurilă), hence respecting the condition that each iepure must eat less than its subordinates. The result is calculated modulo a given constant `MOD` to avoid exceeding numerical limits.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it appears that the logic of finding the root by taking the last 'a' read from the input file is incorrect. This method incorrectly assumes that the root is one of the 'a' values from the last pair read, which is not a valid assumption. The root is the only node that is not a child of any other node, and the logic to find the root should be fixed accordingly.

Another issue is that the `dp` array should accumulate the number of ways considering that a node can eat from 1 to K carrots, which the original implementation didn't handle correctly.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution accordingly:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MOD = 30011;

int N, K, dp[101][101], ways[101];
std::vector<int> children[101];

void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1; // Base case: a node can always be assigned 0 carrots in 1 way.

    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        // Multiply ways for this node with the dp for its child.
        memset(ways, 0, sizeof(ways));
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j + i <= K; ++j) {
                ways[i + j] = (ways[i + j] + dp[node][i] * dp[child][j]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        memcpy(dp[node], ways, sizeof(ways));
    }

    // Update the dp array for the current node, considering that it must eat at least one carrot less than its child.
    for (int i = K; i > 0; --i) {
        dp[node][i] = dp[node][i - 1];
    }
    dp[node][0] = 0; // A node cannot be assigned 0 carrots if it has children.
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    int a, b, root = 0;
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);

    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }

    // Find the root (the node without a parent).
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root);

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[root][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this rewritten solution:
- We use `has_parent` vector to correctly identify the root.
- We perform the dynamic programming accumulation correctly, ensuring that for each node, we consider the number of ways it can be assigned carrots considering the constraints of its children.
- We output the final result calculated modulo `MOD` (30011).

This should fix the issues with the initial implementation and produce the correct expected output.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems we have an issue with the way we are handling the distribution of carrots to the iepuri. The problem lies in the calculation of the number of ways each iepure can distribute carrots to its descendants based on the constraints.

A key aspect of the problem is that each iepure must eat at least one carrot less than its subordinates, meaning we need to consider the cumulative distribution of carrots from the bottom up. In the previous solutions, the implementation failed to correctly propagate the constraints from the subordinates to the current node.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> graph[101];
int dp[101][101];  // dp[i][j] will hold the number of ways iepure i can distribute j carrots to its subordinates

void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node][0] = 1;  // Base case: there's 1 way to distribute 0 carrots (by giving none to the current iepure)

    for (int child : graph[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        // Update dp for the current node by multiplying possibilities with the subordinates
        for (int carrots = 100; carrots >= 0; --carrots) {  // Number of carrots to be distributed
            int sum = 0;
            for (int given = 0; given <= carrots; ++given) {  // Number of carrots given to the current child
                sum = (sum + dp[node][carrots - given] * dp[child][given]) % MOD;
            }
            dp[node][carrots] = sum;
        }
    }

    // Now we adjust the dp array considering the constraint that the current iepure must eat less than subordinates
    for (int carrots = 100; carrots >= 1; --carrots) {
        dp[node][carrots] = dp[node][carrots - 1];
    }
    dp[node][0] = 0;  // Reset the case for 0 carrots as it's not valid for a node with children
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    int N, K;
    fin >> N >> K;

    int root = 0;
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);

    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        graph[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }

    // Find the root (the one iepure that is not a subordinate of any other)
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root);

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[root][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We perform a `dfs` from the root to calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots to each iepure's descendants. We do this bottom-up, starting from the leaf nodes and going up the tree.
- `dp[node][carrots]` accumulates the number of ways to distribute `carrots` carrots among the subordinates of `node`.
- After that, we adjust the `dp` array for the current node considering that it must eat less than its subordinates, shifting all possibilities by one carrot slot to the right.
- Finally, we sum up the number of ways the root node can distribute between 1 and `K` carrots to its subordinates.

This solution should output the correct result of `9` for the given example input and meet the constraints of the problem.

Let's carefully re-evaluate and fix the solution.

We need to ensure that for each node in the tree, we count the number of ways we can distribute carrots such that the node eats at least one carrot less than the total number of carrots its children can eat combined. We have to accumulate this information up the hierarchy, recursively.

Given that `N` and `K` are relatively small (up to 100), a polynomial-time solution is feasible. We can perform dynamic programming on trees (tree DP), where we will calculate for each node, the number of ways to distribute carrots amongst itself and its subtree.

Here's a revised solution with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> graph[101];
int dp[101][102]; // dp[i][j] will hold the number of ways iepure i with j-1 carrots can distribute to its subordinates

// Function to calculate the number of ways modulo MOD
int add_mod(int a, int b) {
    return (a + b) % MOD;
}

int mul_mod(int a, int b) {
    return (a * b) % MOD;
}

void dfs(int node) {
    dp[node][1] = 1; // Initialize the current node with 1 way to have 0 carrots

    for (int child : graph[node]) {
        dfs(child);
        for (int i = K + 1; i >= 1; --i) { // Go from K down to 1 (1-indexed for convenience)
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) { // Distribute j-1 carrots to the current child and i-j to the rest
                sum = add_mod(sum, mul_mod(dp[node][i - j], dp[child][j]));
            }
            dp[node][i] = sum;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N >> K;

    // Read the tree structure
    int x, y;
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        fin >> x >> y;
        graph[x].push_back(y);
        has_parent[y] = true;
    }

    // Identify the root (node without a parent)
    int root = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root);

    // The answer is the sum of ways to distribute 1 to K carrots to the root
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= K + 1; i++) { // 1-indexed, so it corresponds to 0 to K-1 carrots
        result = add_mod(result, dp[root][i]);
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Here, we have revised the DFS function to properly account for the carrot distribution constraints. We have also adjusted the DP array to be 1-indexed for easier understanding and management of the 0-carrot case. 

We start each node with 1 way to have 0 carrots and then recursively calculate the number of ways based on its children's distributions. The root's answer is the sum of ways to distribute carrots such that it has from 0 to K-1 carrots, which corresponds to indices 2 to K+1 in our 1-indexed DP array.

This code should now correctly calculate the number of ways to distribute the carrots, and thus match the expected output.

It seems that the error message is indicating that the variable `K` is not declared in the scope of the `dfs` function. This is because we need to pass `K` as a parameter to the function or make it a global variable. Since `K` is already being used as a global variable, the issue is likely that it has not been declared correctly in the global scope. Let's fix the declaration of `K` and ensure it is accessible within `dfs` and `main`.

Here is the revised source code with the necessary fix applied:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> graph[101];

}

void dfs(int node) {

            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) { // Distribute j-1 carrots to the current child and i-j to the rest
                sum = add_mod(sum, mul_mod(dp[node][i - j], dp[child][j]));
            }
            dp[node][i] = sum;
        }
    }
}

    fin >> N >> K; // Read N and K from the input file

    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        fin >> x >> y;
        graph[x].push_back(y);
        has_parent[y] = true;
    }

    int root = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root);

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= K + 1; i++) {

    }

    fout << result << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

I've added the global declaration for `K` at the top of the code, so it is visible in both `dfs` and `main`. This should resolve the compilation errors, and the program should now compile and run correctly.

After revisiting the problem, it seems that the logic in the `dfs` function needs to be corrected to accurately reflect the constraints of the problem. The previous implementations failed to correctly account for the hierarchical structure and the limitation that each iepure must eat at least one carrot less than its subordinate.

Let's fix the logic by making sure that for each iepure, we calculate the number of ways it can distribute carrots to itself and its subtree, considering it must eat one less carrot than the sum of the maximum carrots eaten by each of its children.

Here is the revised and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 30011;

int N, K; // Global variables for number of iepuri and maximum number of carrots
std::vector<int> children[101];
int dp[101][102]; // dp[node][carrots] - number of ways to distribute carrots to node and its subtree

void dfs(int node) {
    // Initialize the dp array for leaf nodes
    for (int i = 1; i <= K + 1; ++i) dp[node][i] = 1;

    // Traverse all children of the current node
    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        // Update the number of ways for the current node based on the child's distribution
        for (int carrots = K + 1; carrots >= 1; --carrots) {
            dp[node][carrots] = 0;
            for (int c = 1; c < carrots; ++c) {
                dp[node][carrots] = (dp[node][carrots] + dp[node][carrots - c] * dp[child][c]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;
    int root = 0;
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);

    for (int i = 1, a, b; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a >> b;
        children[a].push_back(b);
        has_parent[b] = true;
    }

    fin.close();

    // Find the root (the one iepure that is not a subordinate of any other)
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root);

    // The answer is in dp[root][k+1] since the root can have at most k carrots
    fout << dp[root][K + 1] << '\n';
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

What I changed and why:

1. I've made `N` and `K` global to ensure they are accessible throughout the program.
2. I initialized the dp array for each node to have `1` way to distribute `i` carrots (where `i` ranges from 1 to K+1) because each iepure can eat from 1 to K carrots, inclusive.
3. I updated the DFS traversal logic to compute the number of ways the current node can distribute carrots considering the constraint that it must eat fewer carrots than each of its subordinates.
4. Finally, I accumulated the answer in `dp[root][K + 1]` since the root iepure can have at most `K` carrots, and we need to consider all distributions up to `K`.

Upon further review, the issues with the previous solutions seem to stem from incorrect DP state definitions and transitions. The problem requires us to consider that an iepure can eat between 1 and K carrots, and each subordinate must eat at least one more carrot than its boss. This means that we must count the number of ways to distribute carrots such that if a boss eats X carrots, each subordinate must eat from X+1 to K carrots.

To fix the solution, we'll redefine the DP state as follows:

- `dp[node][carrots]` will represent the number of ways to distribute carrots to the `node` and its subtree, given that the `node` eats exactly `carrots` carrots.

Here's the revised solution with the correct DP transitions:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> children[105];
int dp[105][105], ways[105], K;

void dfs(int node) {
    // Initialize the current node with 1 way to eat from 1 to K carrots
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        dp[node][i] = 1;
    }

    // Process all children of the current node
    for (int child : children[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        // Reset ways for the current node
        std::fill(ways, ways + K + 1, 0);

        // Calculate new ways for the current node considering the child's contribution
        for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) { // Carrots for the current node
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= K; ++j) { // Carrots for the child (must be more)
                ways[i] = (ways[i] + dp[node][i] * dp[child][j]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        // Update dp for the current node
        for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
            dp[node][i] = ways[i];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N >> K;

    // Input tree structure
    int boss, subordinate, root = 0;
    std::vector<bool> has_parent(N + 1, false);
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> boss >> subordinate;
        children[boss].push_back(subordinate);
        has_parent[subordinate] = true;
    }
    fin.close();

    // Find the root (iepure without a boss)
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (!has_parent[i]) {
            root = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    dfs(root);

    // Sum up ways to distribute carrots with the root eating from 1 to K carrots
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[root][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << '\n';
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, the `dfs` function now accurately computes the number of ways to distribute carrots while respecting the hierarchy and carrot constraints for each subordinate. The number of ways is calculated for the `node` based on the possible distributions of carrots to its children.

After the DFS traversal, we sum the number of ways the root iepure can eat from 1 to K carrots, as this represents all valid distributions of carrots to the entire hierarchy. This corrected solution should produce the expected output for the given input.
