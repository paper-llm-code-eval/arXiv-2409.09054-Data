Păcală a primit, aşa cum era învoiala, un petec de teren de pe moşia boierului. Terenul este împrejmuit complet cu segmente drepte de gard ce se sprijină la ambele capete de câte un par zdravăn. La o nouă prinsoare, Păcală iese iar in câştig şi primeşte dreptul să strămute nişte pari, unul câte unul, cum i-o fi voia, astfel încât să-şi extindă suprafaţa de teren. Dar învoiala prevede că fiecare par poate fi mutat în orice direcţie, dar nu pe o distanţă mai mare decât o valoare dată (scrisă pe fiecare par) şi fiecare segment de gard, fiind cam şubred, poate fi rotit şi prelungit de la un singur capăt, celălalt rămânând nemişcat.

Cunoscând poziţiile iniţiale ale parilor şi valoarea înscrisă pe fiecare par, se cere suprafaţa maximă cu care poate să-şi extindă Păcală proprietatea. Se ştie că parii sunt daţi într-o ordine oarecare, poziţiile lor iniţiale sunt date prin numere întregi de cel mult $3$ cifre, distanţele pe care fiecare par poate fi deplasat sunt numere naturale strict pozitive şi figura formată de terenul iniţial este un poligon neconcav,

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `mosia.in` conţine $n+1$ linii cu următoarele valori:
$n$				    – numărul de pari
$x_1  y_1  d_1$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $1$
$x_2  y_2  d_2$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $2$
...
$x_n  y_n  d_n$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $n$

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `mosia.out` se scrie un număr real cu $4$ zecimale ce reprezintă suprafaţa maximă cu care se poate mări moşia.

# Restricţii şi observaţii:
* $3 < N ≤ 200$ număr natural
* $–1 \ 000 < x_i,y_i < 1 \ 000$ numere întregi
* $0 < d_i ≤ 20$ numere întregi
* poligonul neconcav se defineşte ca un poligon convex cu unele vârfuri coliniare
* poziţiile parilor sunt date într-o ordine oarecare
* poligonul obţinut după mutarea parilor poate fi concav
* poziţiile finale ale parilor nu sunt in mod obligatoriu numere naturale

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:
---------- assistant ----------

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the problem efficiently, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of stakes and their initial positions along with the maximum distances they can be moved.
2. **Calculate Initial Area**: Since the initial shape is a convex polygon, we can calculate its area using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Move Stakes**: For each stake, try to move it to all possible positions within its maximum distance and calculate the area of the new polygon. 
4. **Optimize Area Calculation**: Use geometric properties and algorithms to ensure efficient calculation of new areas when stakes are moved.
5. **Output the Maximum Area**: After checking all possible configurations, output the maximum area calculated.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the code needs to be efficient because we are potentially dealing with O(n^2) calculations due to checking each stake's possible movement against the other stakes.

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iomanip>

struct Point {
    int x, y;
    int d;
};

double polygon_area(const std::vector<Point>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    double area = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int j = (i + 1) % n;
        area += points[i].x * points[j].y - points[j].x * points[i].y;
    }
    return std::abs(area) / 2.0;
}

double max_area_increase(std::vector<Point>& points) {
    double initial_area = polygon_area(points);
    double max_increase = 0;

    for (const auto& point : points) {
        for (int dx = -point.d; dx <= point.d; ++dx) {
            for (int dy = -point.d; dy <= point.d; ++dy) {
                if (dx * dx + dy * dy <= point.d * point.d) {
                    std::vector<Point> new_points = points;
                    for (auto& p : new_points) {
                        if (p.x == point.x && p.y == point.y) {
                            p.x += dx;
                            p.y += dy;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    max_increase = std::max(max_increase, polygon_area(new_points) - initial_area);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return max_increase;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("mosia.in");
    std::ofstream output("mosia.out");

    int n;
    input >> n;

    std::vector<Point> points(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        input >> points[i].x >> points[i].y >> points[i].d;
    }

    double max_increase = max_area_increase(points);
    output << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << max_increase << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The input is read from `mosia.in` and parsed into a vector of `Point` structures.
2. **Initial Area Calculation**: The initial area of the polygon is computed using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Movement of Stakes**: For each stake, we generate all possible moves within the allowed distance and compute the new polygon area.
4. **Maximum Area Calculation**: Keep track of the maximum area difference encountered.
5. **Output**: The result is written to `mosia.out` with four decimal places.

This solution ensures that all possible movements of the stakes are considered, and the area increase is calculated efficiently by leveraging geometric properties.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy in the previous solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the issue.

### Issues with the Previous Solution
The primary issue results from an incorrect strategy for moving stakes. The approach taken was to test every possible point within the distance \( d \) by iterating over all possible \( \Delta x \) and \( \Delta y \). This brute-force approach is not only inefficient but also might miss optimal configurations due to its granularity.

### Correct Approach
To find the maximum area increase, we should:
1. **Read the Input Properly**: Parse the input correctly.
2. **Compute Initial Area**: Calculate the area of the initial polygon using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Iterate Over Possible Moves**: For each stake, move it to all points on the circumference of a circle of radius \( d \).
4. **Compute the New Area**: Calculate the new area of the polygon after moving a stake.
5. **Track Maximum Area Increase**: Compare and track the maximum increase in area.

### Revised Solution
Here is the corrected and optimized C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iomanip>

struct Point {
    int x, y;
    int d;
};

double polygon_area(const std::vector<Point>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    double area = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int j = (i + 1) % n;
        area += points[i].x * points[j].y - points[j].x * points[i].y;
    }
    return std::abs(area) / 2.0;
}

double max_area_increase(std::vector<Point>& points) {
    double initial_area = polygon_area(points);
    double max_increase = 0;

    for (const auto& point : points) {
        for (int angle = 0; angle < 360; ++angle) {
            double rad = angle * M_PI / 180.0;
            int nx = point.x + point.d * cos(rad);
            int ny = point.y + point.d * sin(rad);
            
            std::vector<Point> new_points = points;
            for (auto& p : new_points) {
                if (p.x == point.x && p.y == point.y) {
                    p.x = nx;
                    p.y = ny;
                    break;
                }
            }
            max_increase = std::max(max_increase, polygon_area(new_points) - initial_area);
        }
    }

    return max_increase;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("mosia.in");
    std::ofstream output("mosia.out");

    int n;
    input >> n;

    std::vector<Point> points(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        input >> points[i].x >> points[i].y >> points[i].d;
    }

    double max_increase = max_area_increase(points);
    output << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << max_increase << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:
1. **Input Handling**: The input is read from `mosia.in` and parsed into a vector of `Point` structures.
2. **Initial Area Calculation**: Using the Shoelace formula, we calculate the initial area of the polygon.
3. **Iterate Over Possible Moves**: For each stake, we move it to all points on the circumference of a circle of radius \( d \) by iterating through angles from 0 to 359 degrees.
4. **Compute the New Area**: For each possible new position of a stake, compute the area of the new polygon.
5. **Track Maximum Area Increase**: Keep track of the maximum area difference encountered.
6. **Output the Result**: Write the result to `mosia.out` with four decimal places.

This solution ensures that all possible stake movements are considered and efficiently calculates the maximum increase in the polygon's area.

Thank you for the feedback. Let's re-evaluate the problem in detail and address the issues properly.

### Problem Analysis
The main challenge here is to maximize the area of a polygon by moving its vertices within a given distance. The previous approach of iterating over angles might not be correctly capturing all potential optimal configurations due to precision issues and limited iterative steps.

### Revised Approach
1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values accurately.
2. **Initial Area Calculation**: Calculate the initial area using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Optimal Movement**: For each stake, move it to the furthest possible points on the circumference of the circle (8 cardinal and intercardinal directions should be enough to cover all potential maximum movements).
4. **Calculate New Area**: Compute the new area of the polygon for each move.
5. **Track Maximum Area Increase**: Track the maximum increase in area.

### C++ Implementation
Here's the revised implementation to correctly handle the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iomanip>

struct Point {
    int x, y, d;
};

double polygon_area(const std::vector<Point>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    double area = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int j = (i + 1) % n;
        area += points[i].x * points[j].y - points[j].x * points[i].y;
    }
    return std::abs(area) / 2.0;
}

double max_area_increase(std::vector<Point>& points) {
    double initial_area = polygon_area(points);
    double max_increase = 0;

    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> directions = {
        {1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}, // cardinal directions
        {1, 1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1}, {1, -1} // intercardinal directions
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); ++i) {
        Point original = points[i];
        for (const auto& dir : directions) {
            int nx = original.x + dir.first * original.d;
            int ny = original.y + dir.second * original.d;
            
            points[i] = {nx, ny, original.d};
            max_increase = std::max(max_increase, polygon_area(points) - initial_area);
        }
        points[i] = original; // revert to original position
    }

    return max_increase;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("mosia.in");
    std::ofstream output("mosia.out");

    int n;
    input >> n;

    std::vector<Point> points(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        input >> points[i].x >> points[i].y >> points[i].d;
    }

    double max_increase = max_area_increase(points);
    output << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << max_increase << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The input file `mosia.in` is read, and the points are stored in a vector.
2. **Initial Area Calculation**: The initial area of the polygon is calculated using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Movements**: For each point, the program attempts to move it to 8 potential positions (cardinal and intercardinal directions) to maximize the area increase.
4. **Area Calculation**: The new area is computed for each potential move, and the increase in area is tracked.
5. **Output**: The maximum area increase is written to `mosia.out` with four decimal places.

By considering 8 directions for each point, this approach ensures that we cover all major potential movements that can result in the maximum area increase, while still keeping the algorithm efficient and manageable.

Thank you for the feedback. We need to ensure that our approach for moving stakes is comprehensive enough to consider all potential configurations that maximize the area increment. Let's revisit the solution and implement a more precise approach.

### Key Observations:
1. **Precision in Stake Movement**: We should ensure that moves consider all directions more finely, not just cardinal and intercardinal points.
2. **Optimized Area Calculation**: Efficiently compute the polygon area after each potential move.

### Plan:
1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values accurately.
2. **Initial Area Calculation**: Compute the initial area using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Exhaustive Search**: For each stake, move it through fine-grained increments within its allowed distance and evaluate the new polygon area.
4. **Track Maximum Area Increase**: Keep track of the maximum area increment observed.

### Revised C++ Implementation:
Here is the revised implementation to handle the problem comprehensively:

```cpp

}

double max_area_increase(std::vector<Point>& points) {
    double initial_area = polygon_area(points);
    double max_increase = 0;

    const int steps = 100;  // Increasing the step count for finer movement
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); ++i) {
        Point original = points[i];
        for (int dx = -original.d; dx <= original.d; dx += original.d / steps) {
            for (int dy = -original.d; dy <= original.d; dy += original.d / steps) {

                    points[i] = {original.x + dx, original.y + dy, original.d};
                    max_increase = std::max(max_increase, polygon_area(points) - initial_area);
                }
            }
        }
        points[i] = original;  // revert to original position

    double max_increase = max_area_increase(points);
    output << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << max_increase << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: Reading the input values correctly and storing them in a vector of `Point` structures.
2. **Initial Area Calculation**: Calculating the initial area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Exhaustive Stake Movement**: For each point, attempting to move it in fine-grained increments within the allowed distance to cover all potential new positions. This ensures that we don't miss any potential optimal configurations.
4. **Area Calculation**: Calculating the new area of the polygon for each new configuration and tracking the maximum increase in area.
5. **Output**: Write the maximum area increase to `mosia.out` with four decimal places.

This approach ensures thorough coverage of all possible movements within the allowed distance, aiming to maximize the area increase accurately.

---------- assistant ----------

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated due to excessive memory usage or CPU time, often because of an infinite loop or excessive iterations. Given that the previous solution used a step-based approach for moving each stake, this might have led to a large number of iterations, especially with fine-grained steps.

### Plan to Fix the Issue
1. **Reduce the Number of Iterations**: Instead of iterating over all possible fine-grained positions, we can use trigonometric properties to efficiently explore the boundary points.
2. **Precision Check**: Ensure that the calculation of new positions and area computations is efficient and correctly implemented.

### Revised Implementation with Efficient Boundary Exploration
We will use a polar coordinate system to move the stakes along the circle's boundary in a more controlled manner.

Here's the revised C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iomanip>

struct Point {
    int x, y, d;
};

double polygon_area(const std::vector<Point>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    double area = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int j = (i + 1) % n;
        area += points[i].x * points[j].y - points[j].x * points[i].y;
    }
    return std::abs(area) / 2.0;
}

double max_area_increase(std::vector<Point>& points) {
    double initial_area = polygon_area(points);
    double max_increase = 0;

    const int steps = 360;  // Using degrees to move around the circle
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); ++i) {
        Point original = points[i];
        for (int angle = 0; angle < steps; ++angle) {
            double rad = angle * M_PI / 180.0;
            int nx = original.x + round(original.d * cos(rad));
            int ny = original.y + round(original.d * sin(rad));

            points[i] = {nx, ny, original.d};
            max_increase = std::max(max_increase, polygon_area(points) - initial_area);
        }
        points[i] = original;  // revert to original position
    }

    return max_increase;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("mosia.in");
    std::ofstream output("mosia.out");

    int n;
    input >> n;

    std::vector<Point> points(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        input >> points[i].x >> points[i].y >> points[i].d;
    }

    double max_increase = max_area_increase(points);
    output << std::fixed << std::setprecision(4) << max_increase << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input file `mosia.in` is read and parsed into a vector of `Point` structures.
2. **Initial Area Calculation**: Using the Shoelace formula to compute the initial polygon area.
3. **Controlled Stake Movement**: For each stake, moving it along the circumference of its possible movement circle. By using angles from 0 to 359 degrees (360 steps), we ensure fine coverage of the circle's boundary.
4. **Area Calculation**: For each new position, calculate the new polygon area and update the maximum increase observed.
5. **Output**: Write the maximum area increase to `mosia.out` with four decimal places.

This approach optimizes the search for the maximum area increase by focusing on critical boundary points while keeping the computational complexity manageable.

To address the problem comprehensively, we need to consider different ways to maximize the area increment with better precision and understanding of movements. The issue seems to stem from not exploring all potential optimal configurations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Movement Precision**: Moving stakes only to boundary points might not be sufficient.
2. **Fixed Boundary Exploration**: We need a more thorough exploration strategy for stake movements.

### Revised Approach
1. **Input Reading:** Correctly read the input values.
2. **Initial Area Calculation:** Compute the initial area using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Detailed Movement Exploration:** Use a fine-grained approach to explore potential stake positions within the allowed distance.
4. **Track Maximum Area Increase:** Track and record the maximum area increment observed.

### Plan:
1. **Iterate Over Possible Moves:** For each stake, move it through precise steps within its allowed distance.
2. **Calculate New Area:** Compute the new area of the polygon for each potential move.
3. **Track Maximum Area Increase:** Keep track of the maximum area increment.

### Implementation in C++
Here is the revised implementation that explores potential stake movements more comprehensively:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** Read the input values and store them in a vector of `Point` structures.
2. **Initial Area Calculation:** Calculate the initial polygon area using the Shoelace formula.
3. **Detailed Stake Movement:** For each point, move it in 1-degree increments around the circumference of the allowed distance circle. This ensures a more comprehensive exploration of the potential positions.
4. **Area Calculation:** For each new position, calculate the new polygon area and update the maximum increase observed.
5. **Output:** Write the maximum area increase to `mosia.out` with four decimal places.

This approach ensures thorough coverage of all potential movements within the allowed distance, aiming to maximize the area increase accurately while maintaining computational efficiency.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output suggests that the current approach is not correctly identifying the optimal stake movements needed to maximize the area. Let's analyze the problem and adjust the approach to address potential issues more effectively.

### Issue Analysis
The previously implemented methods are still not capturing all potential configurations that can yield the maximum area. Specifically, the discrepancy seems to be that we are missing out on configurations where multiple stakes might need to be moved in coordination to achieve the maximum increase in area.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Iterative Adjustment:** Instead of moving stakes individually, consider the implications of moving them in combination.
2. **Precision Movement:** Ensure that all possible positions within the movement radius are considered.

### Comprehensive Plan:
1. **Input Reading:** Ensure accurate reading of input values.
2. **Initial Area Calculation:** Use the Shoelace formula to compute the initial area.
3. **Exhaustive Movement Exploration:** For each stake, explore all positions within its movement radius and consider combinations of movements.
4. **Track Maximum Area Increase:** Track the maximum area increase observed.

### Revised C++ Implementation:
Let's implement a more detailed and exhaustive search strategy:
