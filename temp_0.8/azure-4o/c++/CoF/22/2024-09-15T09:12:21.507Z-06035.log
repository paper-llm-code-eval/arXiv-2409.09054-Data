Certainly! Let's analyze the difference between the found and the expected output, then provide a corrected solution.

### Analysis of the Problem

The problem involves calculating the number of nodes at a specific distance \( D \) from the root in an infinitely extended version of the given tree. In the infinite tree, each leaf node (except the root) is replaced with a copy of the original tree.

### Key Points to Solve the Problem

1. **Initial Tree Setup**: We need to construct the tree from the input.
2. **BFS for Distance Calculation**: Perform a BFS to find the nodes at each distance from the root in the initial tree.
3. **Count Nodes at Distance D in Infinite Tree**:
    - The number of nodes at distance \( D \) will be cumulative based on the nodes' distances in the initial tree.

### Difference in Results

The provided solution did not account for the infinite nature of the tree, only calculating nodes in the initial limited tree. This is why the found output was 4 instead of the expected 5.

### Corrected Solution

We need to account for the fact that each leaf node extends the number of nodes at certain distances recursively.

Here is the corrected and restructured solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> tree;
vector<int> degree;
vector<long long> dp;

void bfs(int root, int N) {
    vector<int> distance(N, -1);
    queue<int> q;
    distance[root] = 0;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (distance[neighbor] == -1) {
                distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (degree[i] == 1 && i != root) {  // It's a leaf node
            for (int dist = 1; dist + distance[i] < dp.size(); ++dist) {
                dp[dist + distance[i]] = (dp[dist + distance[i]] + dp[dist]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream infile("tairos.in");
    ofstream outfile("tairos.out");

    int N, D;
    infile >> N >> D;

    tree.resize(N);
    degree.resize(N, 0);
    dp.resize(D + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        --x; --y;  // Make zero-indexed
        tree[x].push_back(y);
        tree[y].push_back(x);
        degree[x]++;
        degree[y]++;
    }

    dp[0] = 1;
    bfs(0, N);

    long long result = dp[D] % MOD;
    outfile << result << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is built from the input.
2. **Degree Calculation**: The degree of each node is calculated to identify leaf nodes.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array (dp)**: An array `dp` is used to store the number of nodes at each distance.
4. **BFS**: Perform a BFS to calculate the initial distances from the root.
5. **Leaf Extension**: For each leaf node, extend the counts in the `dp` array for distances beyond its initial distance.

This solution ensures the infinite nature of the tree is correctly taken into account, and nodes at any distance \( D \) are considered.

It looks like the previous solution misunderstood the infinite nature of the tree expansion. Let's analyze this more carefully:

### Problem Understanding

Given:
1. An initial tree with \(N\) nodes.
2. We need to find the number of nodes at distance \(D\) from the root considering an infinite expansion where each leaf node (except the root) is replaced by a copy of the initial tree.

### Key Observations

1. **Distance Calculation in Initial Tree**: We need to calculate distances from the root to other nodes in the initial tree.
2. **Recursive Nature of Expansion**: Each leaf node (except the root) effectively adds nodes at distances incremented by the depth of the leaf in the original tree.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Construct the Tree**: Build the tree from input.
2. **Calculate Distances from the Root**: Use BFS or DFS to determine distances from the root (node 1).
3. **Dynamic Programming to Handle Infinite Expansion**: Use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of nodes at each distance \(D\).

### Corrected and Optimized Solution

Here’s the corrected solution, which takes into account the infinite nature of the tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> tree;
vector<int> leaf_depths;
vector<int> distances;

void bfs(int root, int N) {
    vector<int> depth(N, -1);
    queue<int> q;
    
    depth[root] = 0;
    q.push(root);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (depth[neighbor] == -1) {
                depth[neighbor] = depth[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (tree[i].size() == 1 && i != root) {  // It's a leaf node
            leaf_depths.push_back(depth[i]);
        }
    }
    
    distances = std::move(depth);
}

int main() {
    ifstream infile("tairos.in");
    ofstream outfile("tairos.out");

    int N, D;
    infile >> N >> D;

    tree.resize(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        --x; --y;  // Make zero-indexed
        tree[x].push_back(y);
        tree[y].push_back(x);
    }

    bfs(0, N);

    vector<long long> dp(D + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int d = 1; d <= D; ++d) {
        for (int leaf_depth : leaf_depths) {
            if (d >= leaf_depth + 1) {
                dp[d] = (dp[d] + dp[d - leaf_depth - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    
    long long result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= D; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD;
    }

    outfile << result << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is built from the input edges.
2. **BFS for Distances**: Perform BFS to calculate the distances from the root and identify leaf depths.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array (dp)**: Use an array `dp` where `dp[d]` stores the number of nodes at distance `d`.
4. **Leaf Contribution**: Each leaf contributes to distances in the infinite tree based on its depth in the initial tree.
5. **Result Calculation**: Sum up the contributions for all distances up to \(D\).

This should correctly account for the infinite expansion of the tree and compute the correct number of nodes at distance \(D\).

The previous solution did not correctly handle the infinite expansion and cumulative nature of the tree. We need to account for how the tree expands infinitely by inserting a new copy of the tree at every leaf (other than the root) recursively.

### Correct Approach

1. **Initial Tree Setup**: Construct the tree from the input.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Use BFS or DFS to determine the distance of each node from the root.
3. **Recursive Expansion Accounting**: Use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of nodes at distance \( D \) considering the infinite expansions.

### Key Insights

- Each leaf node adds nodes at increasing distances recursively.
- We can use a dynamic programming approach to sum the contributions of nodes at each level of recursion.

### Corrected and Optimized Solution

Here’s the corrected solution that takes the infinite expansion into account:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> tree;

    depth[root] = 0;
    q.push(root);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (depth[neighbor] == -1) {
                depth[neighbor] = depth[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Store the distances and identify leaf depths
    distance_from_root = std::move(depth);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (tree[i].size() == 1 && i != root) {  // It's a leaf node and not the root
            leaf_depths.push_back(distance_from_root[i]);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream infile("tairos.in");
    ofstream outfile("tairos.out");

    int N, D;
    infile >> N >> D;

    tree.resize(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {

        infile >> x >> y;
        --x; --y;  // Make zero-indexed
        tree[x].push_back(y);
        tree[y].push_back(x);
    }

    calculate_distances(0, N);

    // Distance DP array
    vector<long long> dp(D + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;  // Start with the root at distance 0

    for (int d = 1; d <= D; ++d) {
        for (int leaf_depth : leaf_depths) {
            if (d >= leaf_depth + 1) {
                dp[d] = (dp[d] + dp[d - leaf_depth - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << dp[D] << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is built from the input edges.
2. **BFS for Distances**: Perform BFS to calculate the distances from the root and identify the depths of leaf nodes.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array (dp)**: Use an array `dp` where `dp[d]` stores the number of nodes at distance `d` considering the infinite nature of the tree expansion.

By carefully handling the recursive nature of the tree expansion and using dynamic programming, this solution should accurately count the number of nodes at distance \( D \) in the infinitely extended tree.

The previous solutions failed to account for the infinite expansion of the tree in a correct manner. Let’s re-evaluate the problem and come up with a more robust solution.

### Problem Analysis

**Key Points:**
1. **Tree Structure:** The given tree has \(N\) nodes and needs to be transformed infinitely.
2. **Distance Calculation:** We need to calculate how many nodes exist at distance \(D\) from the root in this infinite tree transformation.

**Steps to Solve:**
1. **Tree Construction:** Build the tree from the input.
2. **Distance Calculation in Initial Tree:** Use BFS/DFS to find distances of all nodes from the root in the initial tree.
3. **Recursive Expansion:** Calculate contributions from leaf nodes recursively.

### Corrected Approach

We need to handle the infinite expansion where each leaf node spawns a new tree. This requires a keen understanding of how distances propagate through recursion. Dynamic programming can be used to keep track of contributions at each distance level.

### Proper Implementation

Here’s a corrected and comprehensive implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> tree;
vector<int> depth_count;
int N, D;

void bfs(int root) {
    vector<int> depth(N, -1);
    queue<int> q;
    depth[root] = 0;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (depth[neighbor] == -1) {
                depth[neighbor] = depth[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    for (int d : depth) {
        if (d != -1) {
            depth_count[d]++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream infile("tairos.in");
    ofstream outfile("tairos.out");

    infile >> N >> D;

    tree.resize(N);
    depth_count.resize(N, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        --x; --y;  // Make zero-indexed
        tree[x].push_back(y);
        tree[y].push_back(x);
    }

    bfs(0);

    vector<long long> dp(D + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    
    for (int d = 1; d <= D; ++d) {
        for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
            if (d >= i) {
                dp[d] = (dp[d] + dp[d - i] * depth_count[i]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << dp[D] << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is built from the input edges.
2. **BFS for Distances**: Perform BFS to calculate the depth of each node from the root.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array (dp)**: Use an array `dp` where `dp[d]` stores the number of nodes at distance `d` considering the infinite nature of the tree expansion.
4. **Depth Count Contribution**: Each depth level contributes to nodes at further distances recursively.

### Key Fixes:
- Ensure correct calculation of how nodes propagate distances recursively.
- Use the distance depth counts to correctly expand nodes at each level.

This implementation should now correctly account for the infinite expansion and compute the right number of nodes at distance \(D\).

The discrepancy suggests that the infinite expansion and distance contributions are not being handled accurately. We need a more detailed approach to correctly account for the recursive nature of the tree expansion.

### Re-Evaluation

Given:
- An initial tree with \( N \) nodes.
- We need to find the number of nodes at distance \( D \) from the root in an infinitely expanding tree, where each leaf node spawns a new copy of the entire tree.

### Key Observations:

1. **Initial Tree Distance Calculation**: First, calculate the distances from the root in the initial tree.
2. **Recursive Contribution**: Each leaf node (except for the root) extends the distances recursively by reintroducing the entire tree at each leaf node position.

### Correct Approach:

- Use BFS/DFS to calculate the initial distances.
- Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to accurately track contributions at each distance level considering infinite expansions.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Construct the Tree**: Parse the input to build the tree.
2. **Calculate Initial Distances**: Use BFS to determine the distance of each node from the root.
3. **Handle Infinite Expansion Using DP**: Use DP to recursively sum the contributions of nodes at each distance.

Here’s a corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

// Global variables to hold tree structure and depth information

// Function to perform BFS and calculate the distances from the root

    vector<int> distance(N, -1);
    queue<int> q;
    distance[root] = 0;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (distance[neighbor] == -1) {
                distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

### Explanation:

1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is built from the input edges.
2. **BFS for Distances**: Perform BFS to calculate the distances from the root and identify depths of leaf nodes.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array (dp)**: Use an array `dp` where `dp[d]` stores the number of nodes at distance `d` considering the infinite nature of the tree expansion.
4. **Leaf Node Contribution**: Each leaf node's contribution is considered by adding nodes at increasing distances recursively.

### Key Fixes:
- Correctly propagate contributions by considering how each leaf node (other than the root) introduces a new copy of the tree at its position.
- Sum up the contributions for all distances up to \( D \) using DP.

This implementation should now accurately account for the infinite expansion and correctly compute the number of nodes at distance \( D \).

Let's re-evaluate and re-implement the solution from scratch while carefully considering the requirements and the nature of the infinite tree expansion.

### Understanding the Problem

Given:
1. A tree with \(N\) nodes.
2. We need to determine the number of nodes at distance \(D\) from the root in an infinitely expanding tree.

### Key Points to Solve

1. **Tree Construction**: Parse the input to form the tree.
2. **Initial Distance Calculation**: Use BFS/DFS to determine distances from the root in the initial tree.
3. **Recursive Expansion Handling**: Use dynamic programming to correctly account for the infinite expansion.

### Approach

1. **Tree Construction**: Build the tree using adjacency lists.
2. **Calculate Initial Distances**: Use BFS to determine the distance of each node from the root.
3. **Dynamic Programming for Infinite Expansion**: Use a DP array to keep track of node counts at each distance considering the infinite expansion.

### Implementation

Here's a detailed implementation that should correctly handle the infinite expansion and compute the number of nodes at distance \(D\):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

// Function to perform BFS and calculate the distances from the root
void bfs(const vector<vector<int>>& tree, vector<int>& distances, int root) {
    queue<int> q;
    distances[root] = 0;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (distances[neighbor] == -1) {
                distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream infile("tairos.in");
    ofstream outfile("tairos.out");

    int N, D;
    infile >> N >> D;
    
    vector<vector<int>> tree(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        --x; --y;  // Make zero-indexed
        tree[x].push_back(y);
        tree[y].push_back(x);
    }

    vector<int> distances(N, -1);
    bfs(tree, distances, 0);

    // Identify leaf nodes and their depths
    vector<int> leaf_depths;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (tree[i].size() == 1 && i != 0) {
            leaf_depths.push_back(distances[i]);
        }
    }

    // Dynamic Programming array to store the number of nodes at each distance
    vector<long long> dp(D + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;  // Start with the root at distance 0

    for (int d = 1; d <= D; ++d) {
        for (int leaf_depth : leaf_depths) {
            if (d >= leaf_depth + 1) {
                dp[d] = (dp[d] + dp[d - leaf_depth - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << dp[D] << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
