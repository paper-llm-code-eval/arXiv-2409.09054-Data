Într-un tablou bidimensional de dimensiuni date $m$ (numărul de linii) şi $n$ (numărul de coloane) există în fiecare celulă o valoare $0$ sau $1$. Un turn este format numai din valori $1$ vecine, de pe aceeaşi coloană, numărul acestor valori egale cu $1$ reprezentând înălţimea turnului. Se consideră că pe o coloană nu există alte valori egale cu 1 în afara celor care intră în componenţa unui turn.

Fiecare coloană poate conţine câte un singur turn. Dacă o coloană are numai valori $0$, se consideră totuşi că acea coloană conţine un turn de înălţime $0$. Dacă o coloană are una sau mai multe valori $1$, atunci una dintre ele este obligatoriu plasată pe ultima linie.

Luând pe rând toate perechile formate din câte $2$ turnuri aflate pe coloane vecine, este posibilă următoarea operaţie de reconfigurare: din $2$ turnuri de înălţime nenulă, de pe $2$ coloane vecine se poate forma un nou turn cu înălţimea egală cu suma celor două. Dorim astfel să obţinem în final numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă. Există însă două condiţii care trebuie respectate:
- înălţimea noului turn format nu poate depăşi valoarea $m$ (numărul de linii ale tabloului);
- orice turn care a contribuit la formarea unui turn de înălţime maximă nu mai poate contribui şi la formarea unui alt turn de înălţime maximă.

Operaţia de reconfigurare se efectuează o singură dată.

# Cerință

Dându-se tabloul bidimensional cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane cu valori $0$ şi $1$, se cere:

1. Să se afişeze înălţimile turnurilor din configuraţia iniţială, precizându-se şi turnurile cu înălţime $0$, începând cu cel mai din stânga turn
2. Să se afişeze înălţimea maximă a turnurilor rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare
3. Să se afişeze numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă, rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `turnuri.in` va conţine:

- pe prima linie din fişier se află numărul natural $m$ care reprezintă numărul de linii şi numărul natural $n$ care reprezintă numărul de coloane, valori separate între ele printr-un spaţiu
- pe următoarele $m$ linii câte n valori $0$ sau $1$, separate două câte două printr-un spaţiu

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `turnuri.out` va conţine trei linii:

- pe prima linie se află înălţimile iniţiale ale turnurilor, valori separate două câte două printr-un spaţiu
- pe a doua linie se află înălţimea maximă a turnurilor rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare
- pe a treia linie se află numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă, rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m, n \leq 1 \ 000$; 
* Testele si restricțiile au fost refăcute pentru standardele anului $2023$
* Se acordă punctaje parţiale: cerinţa a) $40$% din punctaj, cerinţa b) $40$% din punctaj, cerinţa c) $20$%.
* Toate turnurile incep de pe ultima linie a matricii.

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the dimensions `m` and `n` from the input file.
   - It initializes a 2D vector `matrix` to store the grid values and a vector `heights` to store the heights of the towers.

2. **Calculating Initial Heights:**
   - The code loops through each column from the bottom to the top.
   - When it encounters a `1`, it calculates the height of the tower in that column and stores it in the `heights` vector.

3. **Output Initial Heights:**
   - The initial heights of the towers are written to the output file.

4. **Calculating Maximum Height After Reconfiguration:**
   - The code checks adjacent columns to see if their combined height (if both are non-zero) is less than or equal to `m`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum combined height found.

5. **Output Maximum Height:**
   - The maximum combined height is written to the output file.

6. **Counting Maximum Height Towers:**
   - The code iterates over adjacent columns again to count how many pairs combine to form the maximum height.
   - It skips columns that have already been used in a combination to ensure each column is used only once.

7. **Output Number of Maximum Height Towers:**
   - The count of maximum height towers is written to the output file.

This solution performs efficiently with respect to the given constraints.

Let's re-evaluate the problem to identify where the initial solution went wrong and then correct it.

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Calculation of Initial Heights:** The initial solution failed to correctly calculate the initial heights of the towers from each column.
2. **Reconfiguration Logic:** The logic to identify the maximum height after reconfiguration and the number of such maximum height towers was not implemented correctly.

We need to:
1. **Correctly Calculate Initial Heights:** Ensure that we correctly compute the heights of the towers in each column.
2. **Reconfiguration Calculation:** Fix the logic to correctly find the maximum possible height after reconfiguration and count how many towers of this maximum height can be formed.

Here is the corrected version of the `c++` solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("turnuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("turnuri.out");

    int m, n;
    fin >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<int> heights(n, 0);

    // Read the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Calculate initial heights of the towers
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                heights[j] = m - i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0) {
            int combined_height = heights[j] + heights[j + 1];
            if (combined_height <= m) {
                max_height = std::max(max_height, combined_height);
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_height << '\n';

    // Calculate the number of towers with maximum height
    int count_max_height = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0) {
            if (heights[j] + heights[j + 1] == max_height) {
                count_max_height++;
                j++;  // Skip the next column since it's already used in the combination
            }
        }
    }

    fout << count_max_height << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

By following these steps, the solution should now correctly calculate and output the required values as specified in the problem statement.

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem statement and the code to identify why the original solution did not produce the correct output.

### Analyzing the Problem:

1. **Input Matrix Parsing:**
   - The matrix needs to be correctly parsed and processed.

2. **Initial Heights Calculation:**
   - Each column's height should correctly reflect the number of consecutive `1`s starting from the bottom of the matrix.
   - A column that has no `1`s should have a height of `0`.

3. **Reconfiguration Logic:**
   - From any two adjacent columns with non-zero heights, combine their heights if the sum is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Track the maximum possible height from such combinations.
   - Count how many such maximum height combinations can be formed.

### Identified Problems in Previous Solution:

1. The calculation of initial heights was incorrect.
2. The logic for calculating the maximum height from reconfiguration also had issues.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Correct Initial Heights Calculation:**
   - Properly calculate the heights of the towers by checking from the bottom of each column upwards.

2. **Accurate Reconfiguration Calculation:**
   - Iterate through adjacent columns and calculate the potential combined heights.
   - Ensure no column is used more than once in the maximum height calculation.

### Corrected Solution:

Let's implement the corrected solution based on the analysis:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("turnuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("turnuri.out");

    int m, n;
    fin >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<int> heights(n, 0);

    // Reading the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Calculating the initial heights of the towers
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        int height = 0;
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                height++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        heights[j] = height;
    }

    // Printing initial heights of towers
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        fout << heights[j] << (j == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
    }

    // Finding the maximum possible height after reconfiguration
    int max_height = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0) {
            int combined_height = heights[j] + heights[j + 1];
            if (combined_height <= m) {
                max_height = std::max(max_height, combined_height);
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_height << '\n';

    // Counting the number of maximum height towers
    int count_max_height = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0) {
            if (heights[j] + heights[j + 1] == max_height) {
                count_max_height++;
                j++;  // Skip the next column
            }
        }
    }

    fout << count_max_height << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Input Matrix Parsing:**
   - Read the matrix dimensions `m` and `n`.
   - Populate the matrix from the input file.

2. **Initial Heights Calculation:**
   - For each column, count consecutive `1`s starting from the bottom.
   - Store these counts in the `heights` vector.

3. **Reconfiguration Calculation:**
   - Iterate through adjacent columns, and for each non-zero height pair, calculate the combined height.
   - Track the maximum combined height that is less than or equal to `m`.

4. **Counting Maximum Height Towers:**
   - Iterate through adjacent columns again to count how many pairs result in the maximum combined height.
   - Ensure each column is used only once for forming the maximum height.

This solution should now produce the correct output based on the given input and expected output.

The primary issue in the previous implementation was in the counting of the maximum height towers. The code incorrectly assumed that adjacent columns with the same maximum height combination should skip the next column, which led to an incorrect count. Each pair of columns should be considered independently to ensure all possible combinations are counted correctly.

Let's re-evaluate and correct the solution by focusing on:
1. Correctly calculating the initial heights.
2. Correctly calculating the maximum possible height after reconfiguration.
3. Correctly counting the pairs that can form the maximum height.

Here is the corrected version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("turnuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("turnuri.out");

    int m, n;
    fin >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<int> heights(n, 0);

    // Reading the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Calculate initial heights of the towers
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                heights[j] = m - i;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print initial heights
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        fout << heights[j] << (j == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
    }

    // Calculate maximum height after reconfiguration
    int max_height = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0) {
            int combined_height = heights[j] + heights[j + 1];
            if (combined_height <= m) {
                max_height = std::max(max_height, combined_height);
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_height << '\n';

    // Calculate the number of towers with maximum height
    int count_max_height = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0 && heights[j] + heights[j + 1] == max_height) {
            count_max_height++;
            // Instead of skipping the next column, we should continue checking all possible pairs
        }
    }

    fout << count_max_height << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the matrix dimensions `m` and `n` from the input file.
   - It initializes a 2D vector `matrix` to store the grid values and a vector `heights` to store the heights of the towers.

2. **Calculating Initial Heights:**
   - The code loops through each column from the bottom to the top.
   - When it encounters a `1`, it calculates the height of the tower in that column and stores it in the `heights` vector.

3. **Output Initial Heights:**
   - The initial heights of the towers are written to the output file.

4. **Calculating Maximum Height After Reconfiguration:**
   - The code checks adjacent columns to see if their combined height (if both are non-zero) is less than or equal to `m`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum combined height found.

5. **Output Maximum Height:**
   - The maximum combined height is written to the output file.

6. **Counting Maximum Height Towers:**
   - The code iterates over adjacent columns again to count how many pairs result in the maximum combined height.
   - It ensures that each pair is considered independently without skipping any potential pair.

This solution ensures that all possible pairs of adjacent columns are considered correctly, leading to the expected result.

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the matrix dimensions `m` and `n` from the input file.
   - It initializes a 2D vector `matrix` to store the grid values and a vector `heights` to store the heights of the towers.

2. **Calculating Initial Heights:**
   - The code loops through each column from the bottom to the top.
   - When it encounters a `1`, it calculates the height of the tower in that column and stores it in the `heights` vector.

3. **Output Initial Heights:**
   - The initial heights of the towers are written to the output file.

4. **Calculating Maximum Height After Reconfiguration:**
   - The code checks adjacent columns to see if their combined height (if both are non-zero) is less than or equal to `m`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum combined height found.

5. **Output Maximum Height:**
   - The maximum combined height is written to the output file.

6. **Counting Maximum Height Towers:**
   - The code iterates over adjacent columns again to count how many pairs result in the maximum combined height.
   - It ensures that each pair is considered independently without skipping any potential pair.

This solution ensures that all possible pairs of adjacent columns are considered correctly, leading to the expected result.

### Detailed Analysis and Correction

Let's carefully examine the differences between the expected and actual output to identify the specific issues:

1. **Initial Heights Calculation:**
   - This part seems to be correct, as the initial heights match the expected output.

2. **Maximum Height Calculation:**
   - The maximum height after reconfiguration is correctly identified as 5.

3. **Counting Maximum Height Towers:**
   - The issue lies in counting how many pairs of adjacent columns can form this maximum height.

### Identified Issue:
The problem is in the logic for counting the number of towers that can form the maximum height. Specifically, we need to ensure that the counting of pairs correctly considers all possible combinations without prematurely skipping columns.

### Correction Strategy:
1. **Recalculate the Maximum Possible Height Correctly.**
2. **Ensure Accurate Counting of Maximum Height Towers by considering all possible pairs.**

### Corrected Solution Implementation:

Here's the revised C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("turnuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("turnuri.out");

    int m, n;
    fin >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<int> heights(n, 0);

    // Reading the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Calculate initial heights of the towers
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        int height = 0;
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                height++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        heights[j] = height;
    }

    // Print initial heights
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        fout << heights[j] << (j == n - 1 ? '\n' : ' ');
    }

    // Calculate maximum height after reconfiguration
    int max_height = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0) {
            int combined_height = heights[j] + heights[j + 1];
            if (combined_height <= m) {
                max_height = std::max(max_height, combined_height);
            }
        }
    }
    fout << max_height << '\n';

    // Calculate the number of towers with maximum height
    int count_max_height = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        if (heights[j] > 0 && heights[j + 1] > 0) {
            if (heights[j] + heights[j + 1] == max_height) {
                count_max_height++;
                if (j + 2 < n - 1 && heights[j + 2] > 0) {
                    j++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    fout << count_max_height << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
