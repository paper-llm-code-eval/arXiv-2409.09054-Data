Directorul unei școli dorește să premieze la sfârșitul anului școlar pe cei mai buni elevi la învățătură. Pentru acest lucru el are de rezolvat două probleme:

1. Să determine câți elevi vor fi premiați dintre cei $n$ elevi ai școlii. După discuții aprinse cu ceilalți profesori se hotărăște în Consiliul Profesoral ca numărul premianților să fie $n - k$, unde $k$ este cel mai mare număr pătrat perfect mai mic strict decât $n$. De exemplu, pentru $n = 150$, $k$ este $144$ (pentru că $144$ = $12^2$), deci vor fi premiați $150 - 144 = 6$ elevi.
2. Pentru a fi cât mai multă liniște la premiere, în Consiliul Profesoral se ia decizia ca elevii care nu vor fi premiați să fie așezați pe terenul de sport pe rânduri de câte $p$ elevi (unde $p^2 = k$). În acest scop, directorul a numerotat elevii nepremiați de la $1$ la $k$ și a hotărât ca elevii să fie așezați în ordinea descrescătoare a numerelor asociate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de elevi din școală și calculează numărul de elevi premiați precum și modul de așezare a elevilor nepremiați.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `lascoala.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `lascoala.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul de elevi premiați, iar pe următoarele linii așezarea elevilor nepremiați.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 700$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("lascoala.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("lascoala.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    // Find the largest perfect square k less than n
    int p = static_cast<int>(std::sqrt(n)) - 1;
    int k = p * p;

    // Number of students to be awarded
    int awarded = n - k;
    outfile << awarded << "\n";

    // Arrange the non-awarded students in rows of p students each
    std::vector<int> non_awarded_students(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        non_awarded_students[i] = k - i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < p; ++j) {
            outfile << non_awarded_students[i * p + j] << " ";
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of students `n` from the file `lascoala.in`.

2. **Finding the Largest Perfect Square:**
   - The `std::sqrt(n)` function returns the square root of `n`.
   - By subtracting 1 from the integer part of the square root, we find the largest integer `p` such that `p^2 < n`.
   - `k` is then `p * p`.

3. **Calculating Awarded Students:**
   - The number of awarded students is `n - k`.

4. **Arranging Non-Awarded Students:**
   - We create a vector of size `k` and fill it with numbers from `k` to `1`.
   - We then print the numbers in rows of `p` students each.

5. **Writing Output:**
   - We write the number of awarded students and the arrangement of non-awarded students to the file `lascoala.out`.

This solution ensures efficient computation and correct formatting for the output.

Let's reevaluate the problem and identify the issues in the previous solution, then implement the corrected code:

### Differences in Results
- The previous solution incorrectly calculated the number of awarded students and their arrangement.
- The main bug was in the calculation of `p`. It used `p = static_cast<int>(std::sqrt(n)) - 1`, which is incorrect because it subtracts 1 even if `std::sqrt(n)` itself is an integer.

### Steps for Correction
1. **Correct Calculation of `p`:**
   - Calculate `p` correctly by just taking the integer part of the square root of `n` and using it directly.
   - Ensure `k` is the square of this `p`.

2. **Correct Number of Awarded Students:**
   - Use the correct value of `k` to determine the number of awarded students as `n - k`.

3. **Arrange Non-Awarded Students:**
   - Ensure the arrangement in descending order in rows of `p`.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("lascoala.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("lascoala.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    // Find the largest perfect square k less than n
    int p = static_cast<int>(std::sqrt(n));
    int k = p * p;

    // Number of students to be awarded
    int awarded = n - k;
    outfile << awarded << "\n";

    // Arrange the non-awarded students in rows of p students each
    std::vector<int> non_awarded_students(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        non_awarded_students[i] = k - i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < p; ++j) {
            outfile << non_awarded_students[i * p + j] << " ";
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Correct Code
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of students `n` from `lascoala.in`.

2. **Finding the Largest Perfect Square:**
   - Compute `p` as the integer part of the square root of `n`.
   - Compute `k` as `p * p`.

3. **Calculating Awarded Students:**
   - Compute the number of awarded students as `n - k`.

4. **Arranging Non-Awarded Students:**
   - Create a vector filled with numbers from `k` down to `1`.
   - Print these numbers in rows of `p`.

5. **Writing Output:**
   - Write the number of awarded students and the arrangement of non-awarded students to `lascoala.out`.

This corrected solution ensures accurate computation and formatting per the problem's requirements.

Let's carefully evaluate and address the differences between the expected and found results.

### Differences in Results
- The output generated by the program is very close to the expected output, with the only apparent difference being the presence of trailing spaces in the lines of the output.
- The expected output does not include trailing spaces at the end of each line.

### Steps for Correction
1. **Remove Trailing Spaces:**
   - Ensure that when writing each row of students to the output file, there are no trailing spaces at the end of the line.

### Corrected Implementation
Here is the revised implementation that ensures no trailing spaces are added:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("lascoala.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("lascoala.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    // Find the largest perfect square k less than n
    int p = static_cast<int>(std::sqrt(n)) - 1;
    while ((p + 1) * (p + 1) < n) {
        p++;
    }
    int k = p * p;

    // Number of students to be awarded
    int awarded = n - k;
    outfile << awarded << "\n";

    // Arrange the non-awarded students in rows of p students each
    std::vector<int> non_awarded_students(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        non_awarded_students[i] = k - i;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < p; ++j) {
            outfile << non_awarded_students[i * p + j];
            if (j < p - 1) {
                outfile << " ";
            }
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of students `n` from `lascoala.in`.

2. **Finding the Largest Perfect Square:**
   - Calculate `p` as the integer part of the square root of `n` minus 1.
   - Increment `p` until `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` is no longer less than `n` to ensure we get the correct largest perfect square less than `n`.
   - Compute `k` as `p * p`.

3. **Calculating Awarded Students:**
   - Compute the number of awarded students as `n - k`.

4. **Arranging Non-Awarded Students:**
   - Create a vector filled with numbers from `k` down to `1`.
   - Print these numbers in rows of `p`, ensuring that no trailing spaces are added at the end of each line.

5. **Writing Output:**
   - Write the number of awarded students and the arrangement of non-awarded students to `lascoala.out`.

This corrected solution ensures accurate computation and formatting per the problem's requirements, without any trailing spaces.
