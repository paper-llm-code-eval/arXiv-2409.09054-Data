Într-un laborator de analize chimice se utilizează $N$ reactivi. Se știe că, pentru a evita accidentele sau deprecierea reactivilor, aceștia trebuie să fie stocați în condiții de mediu speciale. Mai exact, pentru fiecare reactiv $x$, se precizează intervalul de temperatură $[min_x, max_x]$ în care trebuie să se încadreze temperatura de stocare a acestuia.

Reactivii vor fi plasați în frigidere. Orice frigider are un dispozitiv cu ajutorul căruia putem stabili temperatura (constantă) care va fi in interiorul acelui frigider (exprimată într-un număr întreg de grade Celsius).

# Cerință
Scrieți un program care să determine numărul minim de frigidere necesare pentru stocarea reactivilor chimici.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `reactivi.in` conține:
- pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, care reprezintă numărul de reactivi;
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află $min$ și $max$, două numere întregi separate printr-un spațiu; numerele de pe linia $x+1$ din fișier reprezintă temperatura minimă, respectiv temperatura maximă de stocare a reactivului $x$.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `reactivi.out` va conține o singură linie pe care este scris numărul minim de frigidere necesar.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 8\ 000$
- $-100 \leq min_x \leq max_x \leq 100$ (numere întregi, reprezentând grade Celsius), pentru orice $x$ de la $1$ la $N$
- Un frigider poate conține un număr nelimitat de reactivi.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the minimum number of fridges required to store all the reagents, ensuring that each fridge maintains a constant temperature that accommodates the temperature range of all reagents stored in it.

### Approach
1. **Sort by End Temperature:** First, sort all reagents based on their maximum temperature. This helps ensure that we can utilize fridges in a way that maximizes their capacity to store reagents within overlapping temperature ranges.

2. **Greedy Assignment:** Use a greedy algorithm to assign reagents to fridges. Iterate through each reagent and try to place it in an existing fridge. If it cannot be placed in any existing fridge, we need a new fridge.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Read Input:** Read the number of reagents and their respective temperature ranges from the input file.
2. **Sort Reagents:** Sort the reagents based on their maximum temperature.
3. **Assign Fridges:** Use a list to keep track of the maximum temperature of the last reagent in each fridge. For each reagent, check if it can be added to any existing fridge. If not, start a new fridge.

Here is the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Reagent {
    int min_temp;
    int max_temp;
};

bool compareReagents(const Reagent &a, const Reagent &b) {
    return a.max_temp < b.max_temp;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("reactivi.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("reactivi.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::vector<Reagent> reagents(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> reagents[i].min_temp >> reagents[i].max_temp;
    }

    // Sort reagents by their maximum temperature
    std::sort(reagents.begin(), reagents.end(), compareReagents);

    std::vector<int> fridge_temps;
    for (const auto &reagent : reagents) {
        bool placed = false;
        // Try to place this reagent in an existing fridge
        for (auto &fridge_temp : fridge_temps) {
            if (fridge_temp >= reagent.min_temp) {
                placed = true;
                fridge_temp = reagent.max_temp; // Update the temperature of the fridge
                break;
            }
        }
        // If not placed in any existing fridge, we need a new fridge
        if (!placed) {
            fridge_temps.push_back(reagent.max_temp);
        }
    }

    // Output the number of fridges used
    outfile << fridge_temps.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:** The input is read from `reactivi.in` into a vector of `Reagent` structures where each structure holds the minimum and maximum temperature for a reagent.
2. **Sorting:** The reagents are sorted based on their maximum temperature using `std::sort` and a custom comparator.
3. **Placing Reagents:** The code iterates through each reagent and attempts to place it into an existing fridge. If it can't be placed into any existing fridge, a new fridge is created.
4. **Output:** The number of fridges used is written to `reactivi.out`.

This approach ensures that we use the minimum number of fridges by utilizing the sorted order of maximum temperatures to group reagents efficiently.

It appears there is a misunderstanding in the logic of placing reagents in refrigerators. The issue stems from the incorrect assumption that updating the temperature of a fridge with the max temperature of the current reagent is sufficient. Instead, we must ensure that each fridge maintains a constant temperature within the range required by all reagents in that fridge.

To address this, I'll use a different approach. Here is the revised plan:

### Revised Approach
1. **Sort by End Temperature:** First, sort all reagents based on their maximum temperature. This ensures that we process reagents in the order of their temperature constraints.
2. **Interval Scheduling:** Use an interval scheduling approach to determine the number of fridges required. For each reagent, check if it can be accommodated in any existing fridge (by checking min and max temperatures). If not, create a new fridge.
3. **Maintain a Priority Queue:** Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the most restrictive end temperature of fridges in use. This helps in efficiently managing the temperature constraints.

### Updated C++ Code
Here is the corrected and more efficient C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

struct Reagent {
    int min_temp;
    int max_temp;
};

bool compareReagents(const Reagent &a, const Reagent &b) {
    return a.min_temp < b.min_temp;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("reactivi.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("reactivi.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::vector<Reagent> reagents(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> reagents[i].min_temp >> reagents[i].max_temp;
    }

    // Sort reagents by their minimum temperature
    std::sort(reagents.begin(), reagents.end(), compareReagents);

    // Priority queue to store the current fridges' maximum temperatures
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> fridges;

    for (const auto &reagent : reagents) {
        if (!fridges.empty() && fridges.top() >= reagent.min_temp) {
            // Use the fridge with the earliest ending temperature that can fit this reagent
            fridges.pop();
        }
        // Add/update the fridge with the current reagent's max temperature
        fridges.push(reagent.max_temp);
    }

    // Output the number of fridges used
    outfile << fridges.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:** The input is read from `reactivi.in` into a vector of `Reagent` structures.
2. **Sorting:** The reagents are sorted based on their minimum temperature using `std::sort` and a custom comparator to ensure that we process reagents starting from the lowest possible temperature.
3. **Priority Queue:** A priority queue (min-heap) is used to keep track of the maximum temperatures of the fridges currently in use. This helps in efficiently determining if a reagent can fit in any of the existing fridges.
4. **Placing Reagents:** For each reagent, we check if the reagent can be placed in the fridge with the smallest max temperature that meets its minimum temperature requirement. If it can, we reuse that fridge; otherwise, we create a new one.
5. **Output:** The number of fridges used is written to `reactivi.out`.

This approach ensures that we use the minimum number of fridges by efficiently managing the temperature constraints using a priority queue. This should resolve the discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs.
