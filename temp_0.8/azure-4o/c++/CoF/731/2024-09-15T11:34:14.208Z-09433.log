Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the minimum number of stops required for each route and then choose the route with the fewest stops, preferring the last route in case of ties. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Read Input**: We need to read input from the file `popas.in`. The format is specified, so we'll parse it accordingly.
2. **Simulate Each Route**:
   - For each route, determine how many stops are needed to ensure the traveler can refill the thermos and reach the peak.
   - Track the current water level and decide when a refill is necessary based on the given distances to the water sources.
3. **Compare Results**:
   - Track the minimum number of stops and the corresponding route.
   - If multiple routes have the same minimum number of stops, choose the last one.
4. **Write Output**: Output the result to the file `popas.out`.

Let's start by implementing the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Route {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> distances;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int num_routes;
    fin >> num_routes;

    std::vector<Route> routes(num_routes);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_routes; ++i) {
        fin >> routes[i].id >> routes[i].num_springs;
        routes[i].distances.resize(routes[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < routes[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> routes[i].distances[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_route_id = -1;

    for (const auto& route : routes) {
        std::vector<int> distances = route.distances;
        std::sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());
        distances.push_back(distances.back() + 1);  // add 1 km from the last spring to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_water = t;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < distances.size(); ++i) {
            if (distances[i] > current_water) {
                // If the current water cannot reach this spring
                if (i == 0 || distances[i - 1] > current_water + u) {
                    // No water source within u km, impossible to reach
                    stops = INT_MAX;
                    break;
                }
                // Refill at the last spring we could reach
                current_water = distances[i - 1] + t;
                ++stops;
            }
        }

        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && route.id > chosen_route_id)) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_route_id = route.id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_route_id;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The code reads all the input parameters into appropriate structures.
2. **Route Processing**:
    - For each route, sort the distances of the springs.
    - Simulate the journey, tracking when refills are needed based on the distance the current water can cover.
    - If at any point the water cannot cover the distance and there's no spring within the additional `u` km, mark it as impossible by setting `stops` to `INT_MAX`.
3. **Comparison and Decision**:
    - Compare the number of stops for each route, and keep track of the route with the minimum stops.
    - In case of ties, choose the route with the higher ID (i.e., the later route).
4. **Output**: Write the result to `popas.out`.

This implementation ensures that all routes are checked efficiently, and the optimal route is determined correctly.

Certainly! The error message indicates that `INT_MAX` is not declared. This constant is defined in the `<climits>` header, which we need to include. Let's fix this by including the `<climits>` header.

Here is the corrected and complete source code:

```cpp

struct Route {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> distances;

    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int num_routes;
    fin >> num_routes;

    std::vector<Route> routes(num_routes);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_routes; ++i) {

    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_route_id = -1;

    for (const auto& route : routes) {
        std::vector<int> distances = route.distances;
        std::sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());

        }

        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && route.id > chosen_route_id)) {

    } else {

### Explanation of Fix:
- Added `#include <climits>` to include the definition of `INT_MAX`.

This should resolve the compilation error and allow the program to compile and run correctly.

The discrepancy in the results indicates that there is a potential issue with the logic used to determine the minimum number of stops required for each route. Specifically, we need to ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when and where the climber should refill the thermos to minimize stops.

Let's review the problem requirements and the logic step by step:

1. **Read Input**: Correctly read all input values.
2. **Simulate Each Route**:
    - Track the water levels and determine when refills are necessary.
    - Ensure that the water level is checked correctly at each distance.
3. **Compare Results**:
    - Track the minimum number of stops and the corresponding route.
    - Choose the latest route in case of ties.
4. **Write Output**: Correctly write the result to the output file.

We need to ensure that our logic correctly handles the water refill strategy and accounts for all possible cases to minimize stops. Let's consider a revised approach that addresses these points:

### Revised Approach:
1. Parse input correctly.
2. For each route, sort the springs by distance.
3. Simulate the journey, refilling water at the last reachable spring before running out.
4. Track the minimum stops and the associated route.
5. Output the result.

Here's the revised and complete solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

#include <climits>

struct Route {

        routes[i].distances.resize(routes[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < routes[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> routes[i].distances[j];

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_route_id = -1;

    for (const auto& route : routes) {
        std::vector<int> distances = route.distances;
        std::sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());
        distances.push_back(distances.back() + 1);  // Add 1 km from the last spring to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_pos = 0;
        int current_water = t;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < distances.size(); ++i) {
            if (distances[i] - current_pos > current_water) {
                // If the current water cannot reach this spring
                if (i == 0 || distances[i] - distances[i - 1] > t) {
                    // No water source within t km, impossible to reach
                    stops = INT_MAX;
                    break;
                }
                // Refill at the last spring we could reach
                current_water = t;
                current_pos = distances[i - 1];
                ++stops;
            }
        }

        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && route.id > chosen_route_id)) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_route_id = route.id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {

    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_route_id;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fix:
1. **Input Parsing**: Ensured correct parsing of input values.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Added 1 km to the last spring distance to account for the final stretch to the peak.
3. **Refill Logic**: Updated the logic to track the current position and water level correctly, ensuring refills happen at the optimal points.
4. **Comparison and Output**: Adjusted the conditions to track the minimum stops and the correct route ID.

This revised solution should correctly determine the minimal number of stops and choose the latest route in case of ties, ensuring the output matches the expected result.

Let's reevaluate the problem and the solution approach more carefully. The main issue is ensuring that we correctly simulate the journey and count the stops accurately, considering the given constraints and ensuring that we minimize stops properly.

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Simulating the Journey Correctly**:
    - Track the current position and the distance we can travel with the current water.
    - Refill water at the last reachable spring before running out.
    - Ensure the logic correctly identifies points where refilling is needed.

2. **Choosing the Correct Route**:
    - Ensure we choose the route with the minimum number of stops.
    - In case of ties, choose the route that appears last in the input.

### Comprehensive Explanation:
1. **Initial Input Parsing and Setup**:
    - Read all routes and their springs from the input.
    - Read the distance the thermos can cover (`t`) and the additional distance (`u`) the traveler can cover without refilling.

2. **Route Simulation**:
    - For each route, simulate the journey while keeping track of the number of stops.
    - Refilling logic should account for the distance between springs and the total distance to the peak.
    - Ensure that in case of ties (same minimum number of stops), the route appearing last in the input is selected.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - Ensure that if a route is impossible due to distance constraints, it's handled correctly.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the revised and corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

struct Route {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> distances;

int main() {

        routes[i].distances.resize(routes[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < routes[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> routes[i].distances[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_route_id = -1;

    for (const auto& route : routes) {
        std::vector<int> distances = route.distances;
        std::sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());
        distances.push_back(distances.back() + 1);  // Add 1 km from the last spring to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_pos = 0;
        int current_water = t;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < distances.size(); ++i) {
            if (distances[i] - current_pos > current_water) {
                // If the current water cannot reach this spring
                if (i == 0 || distances[i] - current_pos > current_water + u) {
                    // No water source within u km, impossible to reach
                    stops = INT_MAX;
                    break;
                }
                // Refill at the last spring we could reach
                current_water = t;
                current_pos = distances[i - 1];
                ++stops;
            }
        }

        if (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && route.id > chosen_route_id)) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_route_id = route.id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_route_id;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Adjustments:
1. **Correct Simulation**:
    - Adjusted the refill logic to ensure the water refill happens correctly based on the difference between the current position and the springs.
    - Ensured that if a route is impossible (no spring within the required distance), it's marked correctly.

2. **Correct Comparison**:
    - Correctly comparing the stops for each route and updating the chosen route based on the minimum stops.
    - Ensuring the latest route is chosen in case of ties.

This revised solution should correctly account for the given constraints and ensure the minimum number of stops is calculated accurately.

The issue appears to stem from the refill logic, which currently doesn't handle all edge cases correctly, especially the condition when the traveler is out of water and needs to refill. Let's analyze the problem more carefully and ensure the code correctly determines the minimum number of stops for each route.

### Analysis:
1. **Expectations**:
    - For each route, determine the minimal number of stops needed to reach the peak.
    - Choose the last route in case of ties with the same minimal number of stops.
2. **Current Issues**:
    - The current logic might not correctly simulate the need to refill at the last possible spring before running out, especially considering the `u` (extra distance without water).
    - Incorrect comparison logic for determining the number of refills needed.

### Plan:
1. Parse input correctly.
2. For each route, simulate the journey to determine the minimal number of stops.
3. Track the minimum stops and the corresponding route.
4. Output the result.

### Revised Approach:
We need to update the simulation logic to correctly handle the distance between springs and ensure the traveler refills at the last possible spring.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the revised and corrected C++ code:

        routes[i].distances.resize(routes[i].num_springs);

                if (i == 0 || distances[i] - distances[i - 1] > t) {
                    // No water source within t km, impossible to reach

### Explanation of Adjustments:
1. **Refill Logic**:
   - Added a check to ensure we refill at the last possible spring before the water runs out.
   - Considered the case where even after refilling, the distance to the next spring is too far.
2. **Distance Handling**:
   - Ensured that we check the distance between springs correctly and update the current position and water level accordingly.
3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - Correctly comparing the number of stops for each route and updating the chosen route based on the minimum stops.
   - Ensuring the latest route is chosen in case of ties.

This revised solution should correctly simulate the journey and determine the minimum number of stops, ensuring the output matches the expected result.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and debug the solution thoroughly. The core issue lies in correctly simulating the journey, ensuring proper water refills, and accurately counting the number of stops. There's also a need to handle edge cases effectively.

### Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: Correctly read and parse the input data.
2. **Simulation**:
    - Track the current water capacity and position.
    - Refill water at the last possible spring before running out.
    - Ensure the logic correctly identifies the optimal points for refilling.
3. **Comparison**:
    - Track the route with the minimum number of stops.
    - Ensure that in case of ties, the last route in the input is selected.
4. **Output**: Correctly write the results to the output file.

### Common Pitfalls:
- Incorrect handling of distances and refill logic.
- Not refilling at the last possible spring, leading to suboptimal solutions.
- Incorrectly determining when a route is not feasible.

### Comprehensive Explanation:
The solution should:
1. **Read the input** and parse the values.
2. **Simulate each route** to determine the minimal stops required:
    - Sort the distances of springs for each route.
    - Add the final distance to the peak (1 km from the last spring).
    - Track the current position and water level.
    - Refill at the last reachable spring before the water runs out.
3. **Determine the optimal route**:
    - Compare the number of stops for each route.
    - In case of ties, prefer the route appearing later in the input.
4. **Output the results correctly**.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the revised C++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

struct Route {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> distances;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int num_routes;
    fin >> num_routes;

    std::vector<Route> routes(num_routes);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_routes; ++i) {
        fin >> routes[i].id >> routes[i].num_springs;
        routes[i].distances.resize(routes[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < routes[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> routes[i].distances[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_route_id = -1;

    for (const auto& route : routes) {
        std::vector<int> distances = route.distances;
        distances.push_back(distances.back() + 1);  // Add 1 km from the last spring to the peak
        std::sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());

        int stops = 0;
        int current_pos = 0;
        int current_water = t;

        bool possible = true;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < distances.size(); ++i) {
            if (distances[i] - current_pos > current_water) {
                // If the current water cannot reach this spring
                if (i == 0 || distances[i] - distances[i - 1] > t) {
                    // No water source within t km, impossible to reach
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
                // Refill at the last spring we could reach
                current_water = t;
                current_pos = distances[i - 1];
                ++stops;
                
                if (distances[i] - current_pos > current_water) {
                    // If after refill we still can't reach the next spring, it's impossible
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (possible && (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && route.id > chosen_route_id))) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_route_id = route.id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_route_id;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Adjustments:
1. **Input Parsing**: Correctly read all input values.
2. **Simulation**:
    - Added a check to ensure refills happen at the last possible spring before running out of water.
    - Ensured correct distance handling between springs and the final peak.
3. **Comparison and Output**:
    - Correctly compare the number of stops for each route and update the chosen route based on the minimum stops.
    - Ensure the latest route is chosen in case of ties.

By ensuring these points are addressed, the solution should correctly simulate the journey, minimize the number of stops, and output the expected results.

Given the problem and the persistent issue, it appears that the current approach might not be correctly simulating the travel and refills. Specifically, the bug seems to be in ensuring the traveler can always reach the next spring or the peak with optimal refills.

Let's re-implement the solution with a clearer approach and more structured logic. We will:
1. **Parse the input data**.
2. **Simulate each route** carefully:
    - Ensure the traveler can move from one spring to the next and finally to the peak.
    - Track the minimum number of refills required.
3. **Determine the best route** with the fewest refills, selecting the latest one in case of ties.
4. **Output the result**.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Read input**.
2. **Process each route**:
    - Sort spring distances.
    - Track water usage and refills.
    - Ensure the traveler can reach the peak.
3. **Select the optimal route**.
4. **Output the result**.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the revised C++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

struct Route {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> distances;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int num_routes;
    fin >> num_routes;

    std::vector<Route> routes(num_routes);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_routes; ++i) {
        fin >> routes[i].id >> routes[i].num_springs;
        routes[i].distances.resize(routes[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < routes[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> routes[i].distances[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_route_id = -1;

    for (const auto& route : routes) {
        std::vector<int> distances = route.distances;
        std::sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());
        distances.push_back(distances.back() + 1);  // Add 1 km from the last spring to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_water = t;
        int last_pos = 0;
        bool possible = true;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < distances.size(); ++i) {
            int distance_to_next = distances[i] - last_pos;

            if (distance_to_next > current_water) {
                if (i == 0 || distances[i] - distances[i - 1] > t) {
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
                
                // Refill at the farthest reachable spring
                current_water = t - (distances[i] - distances[i - 1]);
                last_pos = distances[i - 1];
                ++stops;
                
                // Check if we can reach the next spring after the refill
                if (distances[i] - last_pos > current_water) {
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
            } else {
                current_water -= distance_to_next;
                last_pos = distances[i];
            }
        }

        if (possible && (stops < min_stops || (stops == min_stops && route.id > chosen_route_id))) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_route_id = route.id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_route_id;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: Correctly read the input values.
2. **Route Simulation**:
    - Sort the spring distances.
    - Track the current water level and position.
    - Refill at the furthest reachable spring before running out.
    - Ensure we correctly simulate the journey and determine if the route is possible.
3. **Comparison and Output**:
    - Track the minimum number of stops and the associated route.
    - Ensure the latest route is selected in case of ties.

### Detailed Walkthrough:
1. **Input Reading**:
    - Read the number of routes and each route's springs.
    - Read `t` (distance the water lasts) and `u` (extra distance without water).
2. **Route Processing**:
    - Sort springs and add the final peak distance.
    - Simulate the travel, considering water usage and refills.
    - Track the minimal stops and ensure feasibility.
3. **Output**:
    - Write the result to the output file, considering the best route.

This revised solution should correctly handle the problem constraints and provide the expected results.
