Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Let's break down the problem and come up with a strategy:

1. **Input Reading**: We need to read the input from the `popas.in` file.
2. **Initialization**: We initialize variables to store the number of trails, distances, and water sources for each trail.
3. **Simulation**: For each trail, simulate the hiker's journey to the summit. The simulation should count the number of stops made to refill water and check if the hiker can reach the summit.
4. **Optimization**: Track the minimum number of stops for each trail and identify the trail which meets the criteria with the least stops.
5. **Output**: Write the result to `popas.out`.

The approach:
- For each trail, simulate the hiker's journey.
- Use a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of refilling stops.
- Ensure that the hiker's water lasts for the necessary distance and check if the hiker can reach the summit.

Here is the C++ code to solve this problem:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Trail {
    int id;
    vector<int> springs;
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("popas.in");
    ofstream outFile("popas.out");

    int k;
    inFile >> k;

    vector<Trail> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int id, r;
        inFile >> id >> r;
        trails[i].id = id;
        trails[i].springs.resize(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            inFile >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    inFile >> t >> u;

    int minStops = INT_MAX;
    int bestTrailId = -1;

    for (const auto &trail : trails) {
        vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        springs.push_back(INT_MAX); // Add a marker for the end
        int stops = 0, currentDistance = 0, lastRefill = 0;
        bool canReach = true;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            if (springs[i] - lastRefill > u) { // Check if the next spring is reachable without water
                canReach = false;
                break;
            }

            if (springs[i] > currentDistance + t) {
                if (currentDistance + u >= springs[i]) {
                    currentDistance = springs[i - 1];
                    lastRefill = currentDistance;
                    ++stops;
                } else {
                    canReach = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (canReach && stops < minStops) {
            minStops = stops;
            bestTrailId = trail.id;
        } else if (canReach && stops == minStops) {
            bestTrailId = max(bestTrailId, trail.id);
        }
    }

    if (minStops == INT_MAX) {
        outFile << "0";
    } else {
        outFile << minStops << " " << bestTrailId;
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The input is read from `popas.in`. We store the number of trails and the details of each trail.
2. **Initialization**: We store each trail's id and spring locations in a vector.
3. **Simulation**:
   - For each trail, we simulate the journey.
   - We add a marker (`INT_MAX`) to represent the end of the trail.
   - We check if the next spring is reachable without water and count the stops required.
   - If the hiker can reach the summit with the current trail configuration, update the minimum stops and the trail id.
4. **Output**: Write the result to `popas.out`. If no trail is feasible, output `0`.

This approach ensures the minimum number of stops with the last possible trail if there are ties.

### Evaluation of Differences

The expected output `1 1` signifies that the first trail requires only one stop to refill the termos, and it should be chosen. The found output `0` indicates that the program concluded none of the trails are feasible.

### Explanation of Differences

1. **Incorrect Water Refill Logic**: The primary issue seems to be with how the algorithm determines the need for refills and the feasibility of reaching the summit. If the distance between any two points exceeds `u` (the distance that can be traveled without water), the logic should accurately reflect this.
2. **End of Trail Marker**: The addition of `INT_MAX` as a marker for the end of the trail might be causing issues with the logic for distance calculation.
3. **Handling the Remaining Distance**: The distance from the last spring to the summit (which is always 1 km) needs careful handling.

### Solution Fix

We need to ensure that:
- The hiker can travel from the starting point to the first spring, from one spring to the next, and from the last spring to the summit without exceeding the distance `u`.
- If the water in the termos (`t`) is exhausted before reaching the next spring or the summit, a stop is counted accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Trail {
    int id;
    vector<int> springs;
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("popas.in");
    ofstream outFile("popas.out");

    int k;
    inFile >> k;

    vector<Trail> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int id, r;
        inFile >> id >> r;
        trails[i].id = id;
        trails[i].springs.resize(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            inFile >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    inFile >> t >> u;

    int minStops = INT_MAX;
    int bestTrailId = -1;

    for (const auto &trail : trails) {
        vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1); // Add the summit which is 1 km after the last spring
        int stops = 0, currentDistance = 0, lastRefill = 0;
        bool canReach = true;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            // If the distance to the next spring or summit is greater than u, the trail is not feasible
            if (springs[i] - lastRefill > u) {
                canReach = false;
                break;
            }

            // If the distance to the next spring or summit is greater than the current water supply
            if (springs[i] > currentDistance + t) {
                // If we can't reach the next spring with the remaining water and maximum possible travel, it's infeasible
                if (currentDistance + u >= springs[i]) {
                    currentDistance = springs[i - 1]; // Move to the last spring
                    lastRefill = currentDistance;
                    ++stops;
                } else {
                    canReach = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (canReach && stops < minStops) {
            minStops = stops;
            bestTrailId = trail.id;
        } else if (canReach && stops == minStops) {
            bestTrailId = max(bestTrailId, trail.id);
        }
    }

    if (minStops == INT_MAX) {
        outFile << "0";
    } else {
        outFile << minStops << " " << bestTrailId;
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes

1. **Summit Addition**: Instead of `INT_MAX`, we added the summit directly as the last spring + 1 km. This ensures accurate distance calculations.
2. **Distance Checking Logic**: The code now accurately checks if the hiker can reach the next spring or the summit with the current water supply and the maximum distance `u` that can be traveled without water.
3. **Tracking Minimum Stops**: The code appropriately tracks the minimum stops required and updates the best trail id accordingly.

By ensuring these corrections, the program should now produce the correct output for the provided input.

Given the input and expected output, the discrepancy indicates that the algorithm may have issues with handling distances and water refilling logic precisely. Let's take a more structured approach to ensure correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves navigating through different trails where each trail has several springs to refill water. Our goal is to determine the trail with the minimum number of stops required to refill the termos. If there are multiple trails with the same number of stops, choose the trail that appears last.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Read Input**: Parse the input file to get the number of trails and details of each trail.
2. **Simulation for Each Trail**: For each trail, simulate the journey and calculate the number of stops needed to reach the summit.
3. **Optimal Solution**: Track the trail with the minimum number of stops. If there are multiple solutions, choose the trail that appears last.
4. **Output Result**: Write the result to the output file.

### Key Considerations

- The hiker can only travel a maximum of `u` kilometers without water.
- The termos can hold enough water for `t` kilometers.
- If the hiker runs out of water before reaching the next spring or the summit, a stop is necessary.

### Fixed Solution

        trails[i].id = id;
        trails[i].springs.resize(r);

        int stops = 0, currentPosition = 0;
        bool canReach = true;

        for (size_t i = 0; i <= springs.size(); ++i) {
            int nextStop = (i < springs.size()) ? springs[i] : springs.back() + 1;

                    canReach = false;

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Sorting Springs**: Ensure that springs are sorted. This is essential since the springs might not be given in ascending order.
2. **Accurate Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance to the next spring or summit accurately. If it's further than `u`, it’s not feasible.
3. **Refill Logic**: If the distance to the next spring exceeds the termos capacity (`t`), but is reachable without water (`u`), stop at the previous spring and refill.
4. **Summit Handling**: Handle the summit explicitly by considering it as the last spring + 1 km.

This solution ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum stops required and chooses the correct trail, as specified.

Given that the problem still persists, we need a fresh approach to ensure the logic is correctly implemented and debugged thoroughly. Let's reassess the problem and come up with a revised plan.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Read Input**: Parse the input file to get the number of trails and details of each trail.
2. **Simulation for Each Trail**: For each trail, simulate the journey and calculate the number of stops needed to reach the summit.
3. **Optimal Solution**: Track the trail with the minimum number of stops. If there are multiple solutions, choose the trail that appears last.
4. **Output Result**: Write the result to the output file.

### Key Considerations

- The hiker can only travel a maximum of `u` kilometers without water.
- The termos can hold enough water for `t` kilometers.
- If the hiker runs out of water before reaching the next spring or the summit, a stop is necessary.
- Ensure that we handle the last segment to the summit correctly.

### Approach

- Ensure the springs are sorted.
- Check distances between consecutive springs and handle the water refill stops appropriately.
- Consider the distance from the last spring to the summit in the calculations.

Given the continued discrepancy between the expected and actual output, we need to closely re-evaluate our approach and focus on the logic that calculates stops and checks distances. Let's break down the problem again and ensure we accurately follow the problem constraints and requirements.

### Problem Re-evaluation

The key elements are:
1. **Travel Distance Without Water (`u`)**: Maximum distance hiker can travel without water.
2. **Thermos Capacity (`t`)**: Maximum distance hiker can travel with a full thermos of water.
3. **Springs and Segments**: Springs are checkpoints where water can be refilled.

The challenge is to find the trail that minimizes the number of stops while ensuring the hiker can reach the summit.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Read Input**: Parse the input file to get the number of trails and details of each trail.
2. **Simulation for Each Trail**: For each trail, simulate the journey and calculate the number of stops needed to reach the summit.
3. **Optimal Solution**: Track the trail with the minimum number of stops. If there are multiple solutions, choose the trail that appears last.
4. **Output Result**: Write the result to the output file.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Springs**: Ensure springs are sorted. This simplifies the logic for checking distances.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Iterate through the springs and check if the hiker can reach the next spring or summit.
3. **Refill Logic**: Properly handle the logic to refill water when necessary.
4. **Summit Handling**: Consider the distance from the last spring to the summit explicitly.

### Explanation of Fixes

1. **Sorting Springs**: Ensure that springs are sorted. This is essential since the springs might not be given in ascending order.
2. **Include Summit**: Explicitly include the summit which is 1 km past the last spring.
3. **Accurate Distance Calculation**: Ensure accurate distance calculation between springs and from the last spring to the summit.
4. **Refill Logic**: Properly handle refilling logic to ensure the hiker can reach the next spring or summit.
5. **Feasibility Check**: Ensure that the hiker can always travel the maximum distance `u` without water.

The primary reason for the discrepancy can be traced to the miscalculation or misunderstanding of the refilling strategy and distances between springs. Let's break down the problem more thoroughly to ensure we handle all scenarios correctly.

### Re-evaluation

1. **Distances and Refills**:
   - `u` is the maximum distance that can be traveled without water.
   - `t` is the maximum distance that can be traveled with a full thermos of water.

2. **Summit Handling**:
   - The summit is always 1 km after the last spring.

### Approach

1. **Reading and Parsing Input**: Read the input data and parse it correctly.
2. **Simulate Each Trail**:
   - Sort springs by distance.
   - Include the summit distance.
   - Traverse the trail, checking if each segment is feasible with the current water supply.
   - Count refills and track the minimum refills needed.
3. **Determine Feasibility**:
   - Ensure that each segment between springs and from the last spring to the summit is within the allowed distance.
4. **Output the Result**: Write the result to the output file.

### Correct Solution

Here is the corrected C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Trail {
    int id;
    vector<int> springs;
};

    vector<Trail> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int id, r;
        inFile >> id >> r;
        trails[i].id = id;
        trails[i].springs.resize(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            inFile >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    inFile >> t >> u;

    int minStops = INT_MAX;
    int bestTrailId = -1;

    for (const auto &trail : trails) {
        vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        sort(springs.begin(), springs.end());

        // Add the summit point which is 1 km after the last spring
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1);

        int stops = 0;
        int currentWater = t;
        int lastPosition = 0;
        bool canReach = true;

        for (int i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            int nextPosition = springs[i];

            // Check if the next spring or summit is within the maximum distance without water
            if (nextPosition - lastPosition > u) {
                canReach = false;
                break;
            }

            // Check if we need to refill to reach the next position
            if (nextPosition - lastPosition > currentWater) {
                if (currentWater < u) {
                    canReach = false;
                    break;
                }
                lastPosition = springs[i-1];
                stops++;
                currentWater = t - (nextPosition - lastPosition);
            } else {
                currentWater -= (nextPosition - lastPosition);
            }

            lastPosition = nextPosition;
        }

        if (canReach && stops <= minStops) {
            minStops = stops;
            bestTrailId = trail.id;
        }
    }

    if (minStops == INT_MAX) {

        outFile << minStops << " " << bestTrailId;
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes

1. **Sorting Springs**: Sorting ensures that the springs are traversed in the correct order.
2. **Summit Handling**: Explicitly including the summit distance ensures that the final segment from the last spring to the summit is taken into account.
3. **Distance and Refill Calculation**: Checking both the maximum distance without water (`u`) and the current water supply (`t`) ensures that we correctly determine when a refill is needed and count the stops accurately.
4. **Tracking Feasibility**: Ensuring each segment is feasible by keeping track of the current water and refills ensures that the solution is correct.

By addressing these points, the solution should now produce the correct output for the provided input.

Clearly, the solution still doesn't produce the expected result. Let's reassess the logic in more detail and carefully correct any misunderstandings or errors. 

### Detailed Evaluation of the Problem

Given the input:
```
3
2 3 12 5 9
1 4 2 9 7 11
3 5 2 16 7 9 8
6
2
```

Explanation:
- There are 3 trails.
- For each trail, the distances to springs are provided.
- The hiker's termos can carry enough water for 6 km (`t = 6`).
- The hiker can travel 2 km without water (`u = 2`).

### Expected Logic

1. **Travel Distance Without Water (`u`)**: The maximum distance hiker can travel without water is 2 km.
2. **Thermos Capacity (`t`)**: The maximum distance hiker can travel with a full thermos of water is 6 km.
3. **Springs Handling**: Calculate distances between consecutive springs and from the last spring to the summit.
4. **Refill Logic**: Properly handle all the logic to count refills accurately.
5. **Summit Handling**: The distance from the last spring to the summit is 1 km.

### Reason for Differences

The primary reason for the discrepancy is likely the incorrect refilling logic or failing to correctly track the segments where refills are necessary. 

### Corrected Solution

Let's simplify and ensure the logic aligns perfectly with the problem requirements:

1. **Check the initial segment from the start to the first spring**.
2. **For each segment, check if it requires a refill**.
3. **Ensure that the segment from the last spring to the summit is considered**.

Here's the corrected and simplified C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Trail {
    int id;
    vector<int> springs;
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("popas.in");
    ofstream outFile("popas.out");

    int k;
    inFile >> k;

    vector<Trail> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int id, r;
        inFile >> id >> r;
        trails[i].id = id;
        trails[i].springs.resize(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            inFile >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    inFile >> t >> u;

    int minStops = INT_MAX;
    int bestTrailId = -1;

    for (const auto &trail : trails) {
        vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        sort(springs.begin(), springs.end());

        // Include the summit point which is 1 km past the last spring
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1);

        int stops = 0;
        int currentPosition = 0; // The current position of the hiker
        bool canReach = true;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            int nextPosition = springs[i];

            // If the distance to the next position exceeds what can be traveled without water, it's infeasible
            if (nextPosition - currentPosition > u) {
                canReach = false;
                break;
            }

            // If the distance to the next position exceeds current termos capacity
            if (nextPosition - currentPosition > t) {
                // This means we need to refill at the last spring we could reach
                if (i == 0 || springs[i-1] - currentPosition > t) {
                    canReach = false;
                    break;
                }
                // Refill at the last reachable spring
                currentPosition = springs[i-1];
                stops++;
            }
        }

        if (canReach) {
            // Include the final check from the last spring to the summit
            if (stops < minStops || (stops == minStops && trail.id > bestTrailId)) {
                minStops = stops;
                bestTrailId = trail.id;
            }
        }
    }

    if (minStops == INT_MAX) {
        outFile << "0";
    } else {
        outFile << minStops << " " << bestTrailId;
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes

1. **Sorting Springs**: Ensures the springs are processed in order.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Checks distances between consecutive springs and from the last spring to the summit.
3. **Refilling Logic**: Correctly handles the need to stop and refill.
4. **Final Segment**: Ensures the segment from the last spring to the summit is considered.
