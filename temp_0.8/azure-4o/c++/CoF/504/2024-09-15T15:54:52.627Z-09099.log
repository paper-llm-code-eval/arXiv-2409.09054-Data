Construcția unei noi clădiri a fost finalizată! Frank, celebrul arhitect a  făcut o poză cu fațada. Nu este chiar mulțumit de poză deoarece a observat o înclinație a pozei relativ la orizontală. Asta se poate repara printr-o rotație, iar Frank se întreabă dacă procesul de îndreptare nu ar putea fi automatizat.

Cu acest scop, imaginea este transformată într-o mulțime de segmente din plan, detectate automat cu algoritmi speciali, ca în imaginea din dreapta. Segmentele care se obțin sunt identificate prin cele două extremități, puncte având coordonate numere naturale, în sistemul *xOy*: ($x_1$, $y_1$), ($x_2$, $y_2$). Un segment este numit *aliniat* cu axele dacă este orizontal (paralel cu axa *Ox*, deci $y_1=y_2$) sau vertical (paralel cu axa *Oy*, deci $x_1=x_2$).
Prin rotația imaginii în ansamblu, o parte dintre segmente devin *aliniate* cu cele două axe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru o mulțime de segmente determină numărul maxim de segmente care se pot *alinia*, prin rotirea cu un același unghi a tuturor segmentelor. Unghiul de rotație poate fi orice număr real.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `arhitect.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul de segmente $N$ și pe următoarele $N$ linii câte patru numere întregi separate prin câte un spațiu $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, în această ordine, cu semnificația din enunț, coordonatele ce definesc extremitățile segmentelor.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `arhitect.out` conține pe prima linie numărul maxim de segmente determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$ și $1 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;
* Toate segmentele au lungime nenulă;
* Pentru $40$ de puncte, segmentele inițiale sunt paralele cu *Ox*, *Oy* sau cu bisectoarele axelor de coordonate.
* Pentru $60$ de puncte, fără resticții suplimentare.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to identify the maximum number of segments that can be aligned either horizontally or vertically by rotating the entire set of segments. The key to solving this is understanding that rotating all segments by the same angle will align segments that were originally at similar angles to the axes.

### Approach

1. **Coordinate Transformation**: For each segment, compute its angle with respect to the x-axis.
2. **Angle Normalization**: Normalize the angle to fit within a specific range (e.g., [0, π/2]) because due to the periodicity of angles, segments that differ by multiples of π/2 are essentially equivalent for our purpose.
3. **Angle Counting**: Count segments by their angle classes and determine the maximum count for any class.

### Steps

1. **Input Reading**: Read from the file `arhitect.in`.
2. **Angle Calculation**: For each segment, calculate its angle. The angle θ of a segment with endpoints `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is given by `atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
3. **Normalization**: Normalize angles to a range [0, π/2].
4. **Counting**: Use a map to count occurrences of angles within the same class.
5. **Result Output**: Write the maximum count to the file `arhitect.out`.

### C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>

#define PI 3.14159265358979323846

struct AngleHasher {
    std::size_t operator()(const double& angle) const {
        return std::hash<int64_t>{}(static_cast<int64_t>(angle * 1e9));
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<double, int, AngleHasher> angle_map;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        double dx = x2 - x1;
        double dy = y2 - y1;
        double angle = atan2(dy, dx);

        // Normalize the angle to the range [0, pi/2)
        if (angle < 0) {
            angle += PI;
        }
        if (angle >= PI / 2) {
            angle -= PI / 2;
        }

        angle_map[angle]++;
        if (angle_map[angle] > max_count) {
            max_count = angle_map[angle];
        }
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Angle Calculation**:
   - We compute the angle using `atan2(dy, dx)`, which returns the angle between the segment and the positive x-axis.
   - We normalize this angle to the range [0, π/2) because segments that differ by multiples of π/2 can be considered equivalent in terms of alignment.

2. **Hashing and Counting**:
   - We use an unordered map to count the frequency of each normalized angle. The custom hash function ensures that floating-point angles are correctly handled in the map.

3. **Output**:
   - The maximum count from the map gives the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the set of segments.

This solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 segments and benefits from the properties of the `atan2` function and angle normalization to solve the problem within the constraints provided.

The mismatch between the expected and found results indicates a flaw in the initial approach. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and identify potential issues.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Angle Calculation**:
   - We correctly used `atan2(dy, dx)` to compute the angle of each segment.
   
2. **Angle Normalization**:
   - Normalizing angles to the range [0, π/2) was attempted, but the transformation may have overlooked cases where angles differ by π/2 or more, causing misalignment.

3. **Counting**:
   - The issue could be due to an insufficient method of bucketing angles. Small floating-point errors might lead to incorrect bucketing.

### Revised Approach

To better account for angles and ensure correct bucketing:
1. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Use discrete angle steps to mitigate issues caused by floating-point precision.
   
2. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize angles to a single quadrant [0, π/2] consistently.

3. **Counting with Bucketing**:
   - Use an epsilon value to define buckets around angles to avoid misalignment due to floating-point precision.

### Revised C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

        return std::hash<int64_t>{}(static_cast<int64_t>(angle * 1e9));
    }
};

double normalizeAngle(double angle) {
    // Normalize angle to the range [0, pi/2)
    if (angle < 0) angle += PI;
    if (angle >= PI / 2) angle -= PI / 2;
    return angle;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<double, int, AngleHasher> angle_map;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        double dx = x2 - x1;
        double dy = y2 - y1;
        double angle = atan2(dy, dx);
        angle = normalizeAngle(angle);

        // Check buckets around the normalized angle
        std::vector<double> angles_to_check = {angle};
        for (double d_angle : {0.0, PI / 2, -PI / 2}) {
            double adjacent_angle = normalizeAngle(angle + d_angle);
            angles_to_check.push_back(adjacent_angle);
        }

        for (double check_angle : angles_to_check) {
            angle_map[check_angle]++;
            if (angle_map[check_angle] > max_count) {
                max_count = angle_map[check_angle];
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Angles are calculated using `atan2(dy, dx)`.

2. **Angle Normalization**:
   - The angle is normalized to the range [0, π/2).

3. **Counting Using Buckets**:
   - We consider the angle and its adjacent angles (shifted by ±π/2) for robust bucketing.
   - This ensures that angles differing slightly due to floating-point precision are counted together.

By handling angles more robustly and ensuring correct bucketing, this revised approach should yield the correct result as expected.

I apologize for the mistakes in the previous approaches. Let's reassess the problem and the solution from scratch to ensure correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating them through the same angle. A segment is aligned if it is either horizontal or vertical.

### Key Observations
1. **Segment Direction**:
    - A segment with endpoints \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) has a direction vector \((dx, dy) = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1)\).
    - To determine the number of segments that can be aligned, we need to count how many segments share the same slope after rotation.

2. **Slope Calculation**:
    - The slope of a segment can be represented by the direction vector, but it is more convenient to use angles for rotation.
    - We can use the angle \(\theta = \text{atan2}(dy, dx)\).

3. **Normalization**:
    - All angles can be normalized to the range \([0, \pi)\).

### Proper Handling of Angles
1. **Counting Aligned Segments**:
    - Count the segments that are aligned along the same direction vector.
    - Use a map to count the occurrence of normalized angles.

### Revised Approach
1. **Read Input**.
2. **Compute Angles** and normalize them.
3. **Use a Map** to count occurrences of each angle.
4. **Determine the Maximum Count**.

### Revised Implementation

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>

const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

struct AngleHasher {
    std::size_t operator()(const double& angle) const {
        return std::hash<int64_t>{}(static_cast<int64_t>(angle * 1e9));
    }
};

double normalizeAngle(double angle) {
    // Normalize angle to the range [0, pi)
    if (angle < 0) angle += PI;
    if (angle >= PI) angle -= PI;
    return angle;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<double, int, AngleHasher> angle_map;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        double dx = x2 - x1;
        double dy = y2 - y1;
        double angle = atan2(dy, dx);

        // Normalize the angle to the range [0, pi)
        angle = normalizeAngle(angle);

        angle_map[angle]++;
        if (angle_map[angle] > max_count) {
            max_count = angle_map[angle];
        }
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Angle Calculation**:
   - For each segment, compute the angle using `atan2(dy, dx)`.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize the angle to the range \([0, \pi)\) to ensure that all similar angles are counted together.

3. **Counting Using a Map**:
   - Use an unordered map to count the number of segments sharing the same angle.

4. **Result**:
   - The maximum value in the map gives the number of segments that can be aligned.

This approach correctly handles the problem constraints and should yield the expected results.

I apologize for the previous misunderstandings. Let's address the problem thoroughly and ensure we account for all necessary details correctly.

### Problem Restatement
The task is to identify the maximum number of segments that can be aligned either horizontally or vertically after rotating the entire set of segments by the same angle.

### Key Observations
1. **Segment Direction**:
    - Each segment can be represented by its direction vector \((dx, dy)\) where \(dx = x2 - x1\) and \(dy = y2 - y1\).

2. **Slope Calculation**:
    - For a segment to be aligned horizontally or vertically, we need to consider the slopes. Horizontal segments have a slope of 0 (dy = 0), and vertical segments are undefined in the slope formula but can be treated distinctly.

3. **Angle Normalization**:
    - Normalize the angle of the direction vector to ensure correct counting and comparison.

### Revised Approach
1. **Input Reading**:
    - Read all segments from the file.

2. **Compute and Normalize Angles**:
    - Calculate the angle for each segment.
    - Normalize the angle to a specific range to account for periodicity.

3. **Count Segment Directions**:
    - Use a map to count how often each direction (angle) appears.
    - Consider the segments that are already aligned horizontally or vertically separately.

4. **Determine the Maximum Count**:
    - Find the maximum count from the map, considering both horizontal, vertical, and normalized angles.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>

const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

struct AngleHasher {

    }
};

double normalizeAngle(double angle) {
    if (angle < 0) {
        angle += PI;
    }
    if (angle >= PI) {
        angle -= PI;
    }
    return angle;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<double, int, AngleHasher> angle_map;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        double dx = x2 - x1;
        double dy = y2 - y1;

        if (dx == 0 || dy == 0) {
            // Handle horizontal and vertical segments directly
            max_count = std::max(max_count, ++angle_map[(dx == 0) ? PI / 2 : 0]);
            continue;
        }

        double angle = atan2(dy, dx);
        angle = normalizeAngle(angle);

        angle_map[angle]++;
        if (angle_map[angle] > max_count) {
            max_count = angle_map[angle];
        }
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The input file is read, and the number of segments \( N \) is obtained.

2. **Angle Calculation**:
    - For each segment, the direction vector \((dx, dy)\) is calculated.
    - If the segment is already horizontal \((dy = 0)\) or vertical \((dx = 0)\), handle them directly without further calculations.

3. **Normalization**:
    - Angles are normalized to the range \([0, \pi)\) to ensure all equivalent angles are bucketed together.

4. **Counting**:
    - An unordered map counts the number of segments for each unique direction.
    - The maximum count is tracked during insertion to avoid a second iteration.

This approach correctly handles horizontal and vertical segments directly, normalizes the angles correctly, and ensures accurate counting of segments that can be aligned by rotating the set. This should now yield the correct result.

Let's go through the issue step-by-step and provide a comprehensive explanation for the current discrepancy and a fully revised solution.

### Issue Analysis

The previous solution attempted to normalize angles and directly handle horizontal and vertical segments. However, it seems the method of normalization and the counting strategy didn’t correctly account for segments that could be aligned by rotation.

### Correct Strategy

1. **Angle Calculation**:
    - Compute the angle of each segment using the atan2 function to handle the direction vector \((dx, dy)\).
  
2. **Normalization**:
    - Normalize the angles to the range [0, π) to ensure all similar slopes are considered together.

3. **Counting**:
    - Use a map to count the occurrences of each normalized angle.

4. **Max Count**:
    - Determine the maximum count from the map, which represents the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the entire set.

### Revised Approach

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Input Reading**:
    - Read the number of segments \( N \) and the segment endpoints from the input file.

2. **Angle Calculation**:
    - For each segment, calculate the direction vector \((dx, dy)\).
    - Use `atan2(dy, dx)` to get the angle of the segment.

3. **Normalization**:
    - Normalize the angle to ensure it is within the range [0, π).

4. **Counting**:
    - Use an unordered map to count the occurrences of each normalized angle.

5. **Result Output**:
    - Output the maximum count of aligned segments.

### Corrected C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>

const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;

struct AngleHasher {
    std::size_t operator()(const double& angle) const {
        return std::hash<int64_t>{}(static_cast<int64_t>(angle * 1e9));
    }
};

double normalizeAngle(double angle) {
    if (angle < 0) {
        angle += PI;
    }
    if (angle >= PI) {
        angle -= PI;
    }
    return angle;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        double dx = x2 - x1;
        double dy = y2 - y1;

        double angle = atan2(dy, dx);

        // Normalize the angle to the range [0, pi)
        angle = normalizeAngle(angle);

        angle_map[angle]++;
        if (angle_map[angle] > max_count) {
            max_count = angle_map[angle];
        }
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The code reads the number of segments \( N \) and the coordinates of each segment from the input file.

2. **Angle Calculation**:
    - For each segment, the direction vector \((dx, dy)\) is computed.
    - The `atan2(dy, dx)` function is used to calculate the angle of the segment relative to the x-axis.

3. **Normalization**:
    - The angle is normalized to the range [0, π) to handle periodicity and ensure equivalent angles are grouped together.

4. **Counting**:
    - An unordered map is used to count the occurrences of each normalized angle. The maximum count is tracked during insertion.

5. **Output**:
    - The maximum count from the map is written to the output file, providing the number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the set.

This solution should correctly account for the alignment of segments via rotation and handle the given constraints accurately.

I apologize for the issues in the previous solutions. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the logic to ensure we correctly determine the maximum number of segments that can be aligned either horizontally or vertically after rotating the entire set of segments.

### Key Observations and Correct Strategy

1. **Segment Slope Instead of Angles**:
    - Instead of working with angles directly, we can use the slope of the segments. The slope provides a simple way to classify segments that can be aligned after rotation.
  
2. **Normalization**:
    - Normalize the slope to avoid dealing with infinite slopes for vertical segments.

3. **Counting**:
    - Use a map to count the occurrences of each normalized slope.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Input Reading**:
    - Read the number of segments \( N \) and their endpoints from the input file.

2. **Slope Calculation**:
    - For each segment, calculate the direction vector \((dx, dy)\).
    - Compute the slope \( \mathrm{slope} = \frac{dy}{dx} \). For vertical segments, consider the slope as infinity.

3. **Normalization**:
    - Normalize the slope to handle all equivalent slopes together.

4. **Counting**:
    - Use a map to count the occurrences of each normalized slope.

5. **Result Output**:
    - Output the maximum count of aligned segments.

### Rewritten Implementation in C++

### Explanation

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The code reads the number of segments \( N \) and their coordinates from the input file.

2. **Slope Calculation**:
    - For each segment, the direction vector \((dx, dy)\) is computed.
    - The slope is calculated as \( \mathrm{slope} = \frac{dy}{dx} \).
    - Special cases for vertical and horizontal segments are handled by using infinity for vertical segments and 0 for horizontal segments.

3. **Normalization**:
    - The slope is implicitly normalized by treating different cases separately.

4. **Counting**:
    - An unordered map is used to count occurrences of each normalized slope. The maximum count is tracked to avoid a second iteration.

5. **Output**:
    - The maximum count from the map is written to the output file, providing the number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the set.

This solution uses slopes instead of angles, which simplifies the problem and avoids precision issues related to floating-point comparisons. This should yield the correct result.

I apologize for the confusion and the resulting issues with the previous implementations. Let’s take a detailed step-by-step approach to ensure we solve the problem correctly this time.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of segments that can be aligned horizontally or vertically by rotating the entire set of segments through a single angle. This can be determined by calculating and comparing the slopes of the segments after normalizing them.

### Observations
1. **Segment Representation**:
    - Each segment is represented by a direction vector \((dx, dy)\) where \(dx = x2 - x1\) and \(dy = y2 - y1\).

2. **Slope Calculation**:
    - We can use the slope \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) to determine the alignment of the segments. For vertical segments, we consider the slope as a special case (use a large number to represent infinity).

3. **Normalization and Counting**:
    - Normalize slopes to account for both positive and negative slopes, and count occurrences using a map to determine how many segments share the same slope after rotation.

### Step-by-Step Correct Approach
1. **Read Input**:
    - Read the number of segments and their endpoints.

2. **Calculate Slopes**:
    - For each segment, compute the direction vector \((dx, dy)\).
    - Calculate the slope \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).

3. **Normalize Slopes**:
    - Normalize the slope to handle different orientations uniformly.
    - Use a map to count occurrences of each slope.

4. **Determine Maximum Count**:
    - The maximum value in the map will give the maximum number of segments that can be aligned.

### Revised Implementation in C++

Let's implement this approach:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

struct Slope {
    long long dy;
    long long dx;

    bool operator==(const Slope& other) const {
        return dy * other.dx == dx * other.dy;
    }
};

struct SlopeHasher {
    std::size_t operator()(const Slope& slope) const {
        return std::hash<long long>{}(slope.dy) ^ std::hash<long long>{}(slope.dx);
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<Slope, int, SlopeHasher> slope_map;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        long long dx = x2 - x1;
        long long dy = y2 - y1;

        // Normalize the direction vector to ensure unique representation
        long long gcd = std::gcd(dx, dy);
        dx /= gcd;
        dy /= gcd;

        // Ensure consistent representation
        if (dx < 0) {
            dx = -dx;
            dy = -dy;
        } else if (dx == 0 && dy < 0) {
            dy = -dy;
        }

        Slope slope = { dy, dx };
        slope_map[slope]++;
        max_count = std::max(max_count, slope_map[slope]);
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Reading**:
    - The input file is read, extracting the number of segments \(N\) and their coordinates.

2. **Slope Calculation**:
    - For each segment, the direction vector \((dx, dy)\) is calculated.
    - Normalize the direction vector by dividing by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(dx\) and \(dy\) to ensure a unique representation.

3. **Normalization**:
    - Ensure consistent representation of slopes by making sure that \(dx\) is non-negative. If \(dx\) is zero, ensure \(dy\) is positive.

4. **Counting**:
    - Use an unordered map to count occurrences of each unique slope.

5. **Output**:
    - The maximum count from the map is written to the output file, representing the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the set.

This approach ensures that segments with the same directional vector are counted correctly and should yield the expected results.
