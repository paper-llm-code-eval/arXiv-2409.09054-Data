Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Let's tackle this problem step-by-step to ensure we have an efficient solution.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Read Input Efficiently**: Since the input size can be large, we should avoid using standard input/output functions like `cin` or `cout` and instead use file streams for faster I/O.
2. **Simulate the Wheel Rotation**: We need to simulate the wheel rotation and track when each client gets off.
3. **Calculate Earnings**: The total earnings are simply the sum of the number of rotations each client buys.
4. **Track Client Departure Order**: We need to keep track of the order in which clients leave the wheel.
5. **Determine Last Cabin**: Finally, determine the number of the cabin from which the last client departs.

### Plan

1. Use data structures for queue management.
2. Efficiently read the input values.
3. Simulate the wheel movement and client departures.
4. Write the results to the output file efficiently.

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    in >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        in >> rotations[i];
    }

    // Initialize variables
    int totalEarnings = 0;
    std::vector<int> departureOrder;
    std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> queue;
    int currentCabin = 1;

    // Populate initial queue with clients
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        queue.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
    }

    while (!queue.empty()) {
        auto client = queue.front();
        queue.pop();

        totalEarnings += client.second;
        currentCabin = (currentCabin + client.second) % n;
        if (currentCabin == 0) currentCabin = n;

        departureOrder.push_back(client.first);
    }

    // Output results
    out << totalEarnings << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < departureOrder.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) out << " ";
        out << departureOrder[i];
    }
    out << "\n" << currentCabin << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: We use `ifstream` to read from `roata.in` and `ofstream` to write to `roata.out`.
2. **Queue Management**:
   - We use a `queue` to manage the clients.
   - Each client is represented by a pair: the client's number and the rotations they purchased.
3. **Simulation**:
   - We iterate through the queue, updating the total earnings and tracking the current cabin position.
   - We also maintain the order in which clients depart.
4. **Output**:
   - We output the total earnings.
   - We output the departure order of the clients.
   - We output the cabin number of the last departing client.

This solution is designed to be efficient and handle the constraints provided in the problem statement.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. The difference between the expected and found results is clear:

1. **Departure order**: The order in which clients leave the wheel is incorrect.
2. **Last cabin number**: The last cabin number calculated is also incorrect.

### Analysis of the Issue

The initial solution does not correctly manage the clients' departure from the wheel. Specifically, it seems to treat the wheel as a simple round-robin queue without properly simulating the anti-clockwise rotation and client departure at the correct intervals.

Here is the revised approach:

1. **Use a priority queue** to manage clients based on their departure time.
2. **Correctly simulate when each client leaves**:
    - Track the total number of rotations.
    - Determine the exact time each client leaves based on the rotation they purchased.
    - Calculate the exact cabin number when they leave.

### Revised Solution

We need to correctly simulate when each client leaves the wheel and adjust our data structures accordingly. Here is how we can fix the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    in >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        in >> rotations[i];
    }

    // Initialize variables
    int totalEarnings = 0;
    std::vector<int> departureOrder;
    int currentCabin = 1;
    int time = 0;

    // Priority queue to manage clients by their departure time (min-heap)
    using Client = std::tuple<int, int, int>; // (departure time, client number, cabin number)
    std::priority_queue<Client, std::vector<Client>, std::greater<Client>> pq;

    // Populate initial queue with clients
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        totalEarnings += rotations[i];
        pq.push(std::make_tuple(time + rotations[i], i + 1, currentCabin));
        currentCabin = (currentCabin == n) ? 1 : currentCabin + 1;
    }

    // Process the priority queue
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [departureTime, clientNumber, cabinNumber] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        time = departureTime;
        departureOrder.push_back(clientNumber);
        currentCabin = cabinNumber;
    }

    // Output results
    out << totalEarnings << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < departureOrder.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) out << " ";
        out << departureOrder[i];
    }
    out << "\n" << currentCabin << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: We use `ifstream` to read from `roata.in` and `ofstream` to write to `roata.out`.
2. **Priority Queue**:
   - We use a `priority_queue` to manage clients based on their departure time, which ensures that clients leave the wheel in the correct order.
   - Each client is represented by a tuple containing their departure time, their order number, and the cabin number they will depart from.
3. **Simulation**:
   - We iterate through the clients, updating the total earnings and tracking the time and cabin positions.
   - We push each client into the priority queue with their corresponding departure time.
4. **Processing the Priority Queue**:
   - We pop clients from the priority queue in order of their departure times, thereby correctly simulating the order in which clients leave the wheel.
   - We also track the current cabin number as clients depart.
5. **Output**:
   - We output the total earnings.
   - We output the departure order of the clients.
   - We output the cabin number of the last departing client.

This solution ensures that the clients are processed and depart in the correct order, maintaining the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Upon further inspection, it appears the discrepancy comes from not accurately simulating the anti-clockwise rotation of the wheel and the proper management of the cabins and time. The priority queue approach did not correctly handle the cabin number at the time of departure, leading to incorrect results.

Here's a revised plan and solution to correctly simulate the wheel's operation:

### Plan

1. **Use a queue to manage the clients**: We need to keep track of the clients waiting to board the wheel.
2. **Simulate each step of the wheel's rotation**:
   - Track which client is in which cabin.
   - Update the rotation and departure times accurately.
   - Ensure clients board and depart at the correct times.
3. **Track earnings, departure order, and last cabin number**.

### Revised Solution

Let's implement the solution step-by-step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    in >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        in >> rotations[i];
    }

    // Initialize variables
    int totalEarnings = 0;
    std::vector<int> departureOrder;
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, -1); // -1 means empty cabin
    int currentTime = 0;
    int nextClient = 0;
    int lastCabinNumber = 0;

    // Priority queue to manage clients based on their departure time (min-heap)
    using Event = std::pair<int, int>; // (departure time, client number)
    std::priority_queue<Event, std::vector<Event>, std::greater<Event>> events;

    while (nextClient < p || !events.empty()) {
        // Move forward in time
        if (!events.empty()) {
            currentTime = events.top().first;
        }

        // Process all clients that need to depart at currentTime
        while (!events.empty() && events.top().first == currentTime) {
            int clientNum = events.top().second;
            events.pop();

            // Find the cabin the client is leaving from
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (cabins[i] == clientNum) {
                    departureOrder.push_back(clientNum);
                    cabins[i] = -1; // Empty the cabin
                    lastCabinNumber = (i + 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        // Board new clients
        while (nextClient < p && std::count(cabins.begin(), cabins.end(), -1) > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n && nextClient < p; ++i) {
                if (cabins[i] == -1) {
                    cabins[i] = nextClient + 1;
                    events.push({currentTime + rotations[nextClient], nextClient + 1});
                    totalEarnings += rotations[nextClient];
                    nextClient++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Move to the next time step if any client is still on the wheel
        if (!events.empty()) {
            currentTime = events.top().first;
        }
    }

    // Output results
    out << totalEarnings << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < departureOrder.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) out << " ";
        out << departureOrder[i];
    }
    out << "\n" << lastCabinNumber << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: We use `ifstream` to read from `roata.in` and `ofstream` to write to `roata.out`.
2. **Queue Management**:
   - We use a vector `cabins` to keep track of which client is in which cabin.
   - We use a priority queue `events` to manage clients based on their departure time.
3. **Simulation**:
   - We iterate over the clients, updating the total earnings and tracking the time and cabin positions.
   - We process all clients that need to depart at the current time.
   - We board new clients in available cabins.
4. **Output**:
   - We output the total earnings.
   - We output the departure order of the clients.
   - We output the cabin number of the last departing client.

This solution ensures that clients board and depart the wheel in the correct order, maintaining the constraints and requirements of the problem.

The error message indicates that `std::count` was misused. The correct function should be called from the `<algorithm>` header, which was not included. Additionally, there's no need to use `std::count` in this context because we can determine if there are empty cabins more efficiently.

Here is the revised and corrected solution with the appropriate fixes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm> // For std::fill

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("roata.in");
    std::ofstream out("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    in >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        in >> rotations[i];
    }

    // Initialize variables
    int totalEarnings = 0;
    std::vector<int> departureOrder;
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, -1); // -1 means empty cabin
    int currentTime = 0;
    int nextClient = 0;
    int lastCabinNumber = 0;

    // Priority queue to manage clients based on their departure time (min-heap)
    using Event = std::pair<int, int>; // (departure time, client number)
    std::priority_queue<Event, std::vector<Event>, std::greater<Event>> events;

    while (nextClient < p || !events.empty()) {
        // Move forward in time
        if (!events.empty()) {
            currentTime = events.top().first;
        }

        // Process all clients that need to depart at currentTime
        while (!events.empty() && events.top().first == currentTime) {
            int clientNum = events.top().second;
            events.pop();

            // Find the cabin the client is leaving from
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (cabins[i] == clientNum) {
                    departureOrder.push_back(clientNum);
                    cabins[i] = -1; // Empty the cabin
                    lastCabinNumber = (i + 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        // Board new clients
        while (nextClient < p) {
            bool boarded = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < n && nextClient < p; ++i) {
                if (cabins[i] == -1) {
                    cabins[i] = nextClient + 1;
                    events.push({currentTime + rotations[nextClient], nextClient + 1});
                    totalEarnings += rotations[nextClient];
                    nextClient++;
                    boarded = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!boarded) break;
        }

        // Move to the next time step if any client is still on the wheel
        if (!events.empty()) {
            currentTime = events.top().first;
        }
    }

    // Output results
    out << totalEarnings << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < departureOrder.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) out << " ";
        out << departureOrder[i];
    }
    out << "\n" << lastCabinNumber << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: We read the input from `roata.in` using `ifstream` and prepare to write the output to `roata.out` using `ofstream`.
2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `rotations` to store the number of rotations each client wants.
   - `totalEarnings` to sum up the earnings from all clients.
   - `departureOrder` to store the order of clients' departures.
   - `cabins` vector to track which client occupies which cabin.
   - `currentTime` to simulate the passage of time.
   - `nextClient` to keep track of the next client to board.
   - `lastCabinNumber` to store the last cabin number from which the last client departs.
3. **Priority Queue `events`**: To manage the departure times of clients in a min-heap, ensuring the client with the earliest departure time is processed first.
4. **Simulation**:
   - Move forward in time based on the next event in the priority queue.
   - Process all clients who need to depart at the current time.
   - Board new clients into empty cabins as they become available.
   - Ensure we manage time correctly as clients board and depart.
5. **Output**:
   - Write the total earnings.
   - Write the order in which clients departed.
   - Write the cabin number from which the last client departed.

This solution ensures we correctly simulate the wheel's operation and manage the clients' boarding and departures accurately.
