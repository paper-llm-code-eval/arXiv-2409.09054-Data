Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Below is a C++ solution optimized for speed and correctness, reading from `roata.in` and writing to `roata.out`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Structure to hold client's data.
struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;

            clients.pop();
            cabins[current_cabin] = current_client.id; // Store client ID in the cabin.
            current_client.rotations -= n;
            total_income += n;
            if (current_client.rotations > 0) {

    }
    fout << current_cabin + 1 << "\n"; // Cabin number is 1-based.

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - We read `n` (number of cabins), `p` (number of clients), and then the rotations needed for each client.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Each client is stored in the `clients` queue along with their respective rotations.

3. **Cabins Tracking**:
   - We use a vector `cabins` to keep track of which client is in which cabin and how many rotations they have left.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - We process the clients in a loop, managing loading and unloading from the cabins.
   - When a cabin is visited, we check if a client should be unloaded.
   - If the cabin is empty, we load the next client from the queue.
   - We update the rotation counts and keep track of the total income.

5. **Output**:
   - We write the total income, the order of clients when they exit, and the final cabin number.

This solution is efficient in handling the problem constraints and ensures quick execution by maintaining a constant track of clients in a rotating manner.

The differences between the expected and found results indicate that the initial solution has a logical error in handling the rotations and client exits. Specifically, the initial solution incorrectly handles the rotation counts and does not correctly simulate the clients exiting the wheel.

To fix this, we need to:

1. Correctly simulate the wheel's rotations and ensure clients exit at the right cabin after their specified number of rotations.
2. Correctly update the total income based on the rotations each client pays for.
3. Track the exact order in which clients exit the wheel.

Let's rewrite the entire solution with these considerations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roata.in");
    ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
    }
    
    queue<Client> clients;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        clients.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
    }

    int total_income = 0;
    vector<int> order_of_exit;
    vector<int> cabins(n, 0); // To track the remaining rotations in each cabin.
    vector<int> client_in_cabin(n, 0); // To track which client is in which cabin.
    int current_cabin = 0;
    int time_elapsed = 0;
    
    while (!clients.empty() || !order_of_exit.empty()) {
        // Unload clients who have completed their rotations.
        if (cabins[current_cabin] > 0 && cabins[current_cabin] <= time_elapsed) {
            order_of_exit.push_back(client_in_cabin[current_cabin]);
            cabins[current_cabin] = 0;
            client_in_cabin[current_cabin] = 0;
        }

        // Load the next client if the cabin is empty.
        if (client_in_cabin[current_cabin] == 0 && !clients.empty()) {
            Client current_client = clients.front();
            clients.pop();
            client_in_cabin[current_cabin] = current_client.id;
            cabins[current_cabin] = time_elapsed + current_client.rotations;
            total_income += current_client.rotations;
        }

        // Move to the next cabin.
        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n;
        time_elapsed++;
    }

    // Unload any remaining clients.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (client_in_cabin[i] > 0) {
            order_of_exit.push_back(client_in_cabin[i]);
        }
    }

    fout << total_income << "\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < order_of_exit.size(); ++i) {
        fout << order_of_exit[i] << (i + 1 == order_of_exit.size() ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout << current_cabin + 1 << "\n"; // Cabin number is 1-based.

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - We read `n` (number of cabins), `p` (number of clients), and then the rotations needed for each client.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Each client is stored in the `clients` queue along with their respective rotations.

3. **Cabins Tracking**:
   - We use two vectors `cabins` and `client_in_cabin` to track which client is in which cabin and how many rotations they have left.
   - `cabins` keeps track of the time when each cabin will be free, while `client_in_cabin` keeps track of which client occupies each cabin.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - We process the clients in a loop, managing loading and unloading from the cabins.
   - When a cabin is visited, we check if a client should be unloaded based on the current time.
   - If the cabin is empty, we load the next client from the queue.
   - We update the rotation counts and keep track of the total income.

5. **Output**:
   - We write the total income, the order of clients when they exit, and the final cabin number.

This solution correctly handles the simulation of the wheel and ensures clients exit in the correct order at the right time.

---------- assistant ----------

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated due to excessive memory usage, often caused by an infinite loop or allocating too much memory. Given the problem constraints and the behavior seen, it seems like there's a logical flaw leading to either excessive memory use or an infinite loop in the simulation logic.

Let's reconsider the approach to ensure it efficiently handles the clients and their rotations without running into memory issues or infinite loops.

Here's a revised version:

### Approach:
1. Use a priority queue to manage when each client should exit.
2. Rotate the wheel step-by-step, ensuring clients are loaded and unloaded as per their rotation counts.
3. Use an efficient mechanism to track the state of each cabin.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
};

// Comparator for the priority queue to sort by the time the client finishes
struct Compare {
    bool operator()(const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.first > b.first;
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roata.in");
    ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
    }
    
    queue<Client> clients;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        clients.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
    }

    // Priority queue to manage which client exits next
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, Compare> pq;
    vector<int> order_of_exit;
    vector<int> cabin(n, 0);
    int current_cabin = 0;
    int time_elapsed = 0;
    int total_income = 0;

    while (!clients.empty() || !pq.empty()) {
        // Unload clients who have completed their rotations
        while (!pq.empty() && pq.top().first <= time_elapsed) {
            int cabin_to_free = pq.top().second;
            order_of_exit.push_back(cabin[cabin_to_free]);
            cabin[cabin_to_free] = 0;
            pq.pop();
        }

        // Load the next client if the cabin is empty
        if (cabin[current_cabin] == 0 && !clients.empty()) {
            Client current_client = clients.front();
            clients.pop();
            cabin[current_cabin] = current_client.id;
            pq.emplace(time_elapsed + current_client.rotations, current_cabin);
            total_income += current_client.rotations;
        }

        // Move to the next cabin
        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n;
        time_elapsed++;
    }

    fout << total_income << "\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < order_of_exit.size(); ++i) {
        fout << order_of_exit[i] << (i + 1 == order_of_exit.size() ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout << (current_cabin == 0 ? n : current_cabin) << "\n"; // Cabin number is 1-based

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Reading**:
   - Read `n` (number of cabins) and `p` (number of clients).
   - Read the number of rotations each client requires.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Initialize a queue for clients and a priority queue to manage when clients should exit.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Unload any clients whose rotations are complete.
   - Load a new client if the current cabin is empty.
   - Move to the next cabin and increment the time.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the total income, order of client exits, and the final cabin number.

This solution ensures efficient handling by using a priority queue to manage the clients' exit times, thus preventing excessive memory usage and infinite loops.

---------- assistant ----------

The discrepancies between the expected and found results indicate that while the total income is correctly computed, the order of clients exiting the wheel does not match the expected order. This suggests that there is an issue with how clients are loaded and unloaded from the wheel.

To understand the issue, let's review the following points:
1. Clients should be unloaded based on the number of rotations they've completed.
2. The wheel should process clients in the correct sequence, ensuring no client exits before their rotations are complete.

The current approach uses a priority queue based on the time when clients finish their rotations but might not handle properly the exact timing and loading/unloading sequence of the clients.

### Revised Strategy:
1. Use a queue to manage the clients waiting to be loaded.
2. Use an array to track which client is in which cabin and when they should exit.
3. Ensure clients are processed in a strict sequence, adhering to their respective rotation counts.

### Implementation:
We'll simulate the wheel's rotations, updating the cabins and clients in each step, ensuring clients exit precisely after completing their rotations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roata.in");
    ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
    }

    queue<Client> waiting_clients;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        waiting_clients.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
    }

    vector<int> cabin(n, -1); // cabin[i] stores the client id in cabin i, or -1 if empty
    vector<int> remaining_rotations(n, 0); // remaining_rotations[i] stores the remaining rotations for the client in cabin i
    vector<int> exit_order;
    int total_income = 0;
    int current_cabin = 0;

    while (!waiting_clients.empty() || find(cabin.begin(), cabin.end(), -1) != cabin.end()) {
        // Unload clients who have completed their rotations
        if (cabin[current_cabin] != -1 && remaining_rotations[current_cabin] == 0) {
            exit_order.push_back(cabin[current_cabin]);
            cabin[current_cabin] = -1;
        }

        // Load the next client if the cabin is empty
        if (cabin[current_cabin] == -1 && !waiting_clients.empty()) {
            Client current_client = waiting_clients.front();
            waiting_clients.pop();
            cabin[current_cabin] = current_client.id;
            remaining_rotations[current_cabin] = current_client.rotations;
            total_income += current_client.rotations;
        }

        // Rotate the wheel
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabin[i] != -1) {
                remaining_rotations[i]--;
            }
        }

        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n;
    }

    fout << total_income << "\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < exit_order.size(); ++i) {
        fout << exit_order[i] << (i + 1 == exit_order.size() ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout << (current_cabin == 0 ? n : current_cabin) << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of cabins `n`, the number of clients `p`, and the rotations for each client are read from `roata.in`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Clients are pushed into a queue `waiting_clients`.
   - Arrays `cabin` and `remaining_rotations` are initialized to track the current state of each cabin.

3. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The loop continues until all clients have either been loaded or all cabins are empty.
   - At each step, clients who have completed their rotations are unloaded.
   - New clients are loaded into empty cabins.
   - The wheel is rotated, decrementing the remaining rotations for clients in each cabin.

4. **Output**:
   - The total income, the order of client exits, and the final cabin number are written to `roata.out`.

This solution ensures that clients are loaded and unloaded in a strict sequence according to their rotations, accurately reflecting the problem constraints and expected behavior.

The error message indicates that there's an issue with the `find` function call. The function `find` is being used correctly, but the compiler is having trouble identifying it due to ambiguous overloads or missing includes.

The specific error is that the `find` function from the `<algorithm>` library is not being recognized. To fix this, we need to explicitly include the `<algorithm>` library.

Let's correct the includes and rewrite the entire solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <algorithm> // include the algorithm library for std::find

### Explanation:
1. **Include Correct Libraries**:
   - Added the `<algorithm>` library to use the `std::find` function.

2. **Data Reading**:
   - Reads from `roata.in` to get the number of cabins `n`, the number of clients `p`, and their respective rotations.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes a queue for waiting clients and arrays to track the state of each cabin.

4. **Simulation Loop**:
   - Loops until all clients are processed and all cabins are empty.
   - Unloads clients who have completed their rotations.
   - Loads new clients into empty cabins.
   - Rotates the wheel, updating the remaining rotations for clients in each cabin.

5. **Output**:
   - Writes the total income, the order of client exits, and the final cabin number to `roata.out`.

This solution now ensures proper inclusion of necessary libraries and should compile and run correctly, providing the expected results.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated due to excessive memory usage, often caused by an infinite loop or allocating too much memory. Given the problem constraints and the behavior seen, it suggests there's a logical flaw still causing excessive iterations or memory consumption.

The core issue appears to be in the condition for exiting the loop, which checks for empty cabins using `find`. This approach may lead to excessive checks and possible inefficiencies. Instead, we can use a more direct approach to manage the loading and unloading of clients.

Let's simplify this by maintaining a strict sequence control to ensure we rotate, load, and unload clients efficiently.

Here is an optimized version of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roata.in");
    ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
    }

    queue<Client> waiting_clients;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        waiting_clients.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
    }

    vector<int> cabin(n, -1); // cabin[i] stores the client id in cabin i, or -1 if empty
    vector<int> remaining_rotations(n, 0); // remaining_rotations[i] stores the remaining rotations for the client in cabin i
    vector<int> exit_order;
    int total_income = 0;
    int current_cabin = 0;
    int active_clients = 0; // To keep track of currently active clients in the wheel

    while (!waiting_clients.empty() || active_clients > 0) {
        // Unload clients who have completed their rotations
        if (cabin[current_cabin] != -1 && remaining_rotations[current_cabin] == 0) {
            exit_order.push_back(cabin[current_cabin]);
            cabin[current_cabin] = -1;
            active_clients--; // A client has exited
        }

        // Load the next client if the cabin is empty
        if (cabin[current_cabin] == -1 && !waiting_clients.empty()) {
            Client current_client = waiting_clients.front();
            waiting_clients.pop();
            cabin[current_cabin] = current_client.id;
            remaining_rotations[current_cabin] = current_client.rotations;
            total_income += current_client.rotations;
            active_clients++; // A new client has entered
        }

        // Rotate the wheel
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabin[i] != -1) {
                remaining_rotations[i]--;
            }
        }

        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n;
    }

    fout << total_income << "\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < exit_order.size(); ++i) {
        fout << exit_order[i] << (i + 1 == exit_order.size() ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout << (current_cabin == 0 ? n : current_cabin) << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Reading**:
   - Reads from `roata.in` to get the number of cabins `n`, the number of clients `p`, and their respective rotations.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes a queue for waiting clients and arrays to track the state of each cabin.
   - Initializes a variable `active_clients` to keep track of the number of clients currently on the wheel.

3. **Simulation Loop**:
   - Loops until all clients are processed and no active clients remain on the wheel.
   - Unloads clients who have completed their rotations.
   - Loads new clients into empty cabins.
   - Rotates the wheel, updating the remaining rotations for clients in each cabin.

4. **Output**:
   - Writes the total income, the order of client exits, and the final cabin number to `roata.out`.

This approach ensures the loop condition accurately reflects when all clients have been processed and there are no more active clients on the wheel, thereby avoiding infinite loops and excessive memory usage.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated due to excessive memory usage or a long-running process, often caused by an infinite loop. Given that the logic seems sound, we may need to break down the problem further and ensure we are not running into an infinite loop by carefully tracking client unloading and loading without redundant checks.

To ensure correct simulation while avoiding excessive checks, we can:
1. Maintain a clear tracking of which client is in which cabin.
2. Ensure we only rotate and check the cabins sequentially without redundant operations.
3. Ensure to stop the loop correctly when all clients have been processed.

Let's simplify and rewrite the solution with these considerations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roata.in");
    ofstream fout("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    fin >> n >> p;

    vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        fin >> rotations[i];
    }

    queue<Client> waiting_clients;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        waiting_clients.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
    }

    vector<int> cabin(n, -1); // cabin[i] stores the client id in cabin i, or -1 if empty
    vector<int> remaining_rotations(n, 0); // remaining_rotations[i] stores the remaining rotations for the client in cabin i
    vector<int> exit_order;
    int total_income = 0;
    int current_cabin = 0;
    int active_clients = 0; // To keep track of currently active clients in the wheel

    while (!waiting_clients.empty() || active_clients > 0) {
        // Unload clients who have completed their rotations
        if (cabin[current_cabin] != -1 && remaining_rotations[current_cabin] <= 0) {
            exit_order.push_back(cabin[current_cabin]);
            cabin[current_cabin] = -1;
            active_clients--; // A client has exited
        }

        // Load the next client if the cabin is empty
        if (cabin[current_cabin] == -1 && !waiting_clients.empty()) {
            Client current_client = waiting_clients.front();
            waiting_clients.pop();
            cabin[current_cabin] = current_client.id;
            remaining_rotations[current_cabin] = current_client.rotations;
            total_income += current_client.rotations;
            active_clients++; // A new client has entered
        }

        // Rotate the wheel
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabin[i] != -1) {
                remaining_rotations[i]--;
            }
        }

        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n;
    }

    fout << total_income << "\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < exit_order.size(); ++i) {
        fout << exit_order[i] << (i + 1 == exit_order.size() ? '\n' : ' ');
    }
    fout << (current_cabin == 0 ? n : current_cabin) << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads the number of cabins `n`, the number of clients `p`, and the rotations for each client from `roata.in`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes a queue for waiting clients and arrays to track the state of each cabin and the remaining rotations for each client.
   - Initializes a variable `active_clients` to track the number of clients currently on the wheel.

3. **Simulation Loop**:
   - Continues looping until all clients have been processed (`waiting_clients.empty()`) and no active clients remain on the wheel (`active_clients > 0`).
   - Unloads clients who have completed their rotations.
   - Loads new clients into empty cabins.
   - Rotates the wheel, decrementing the remaining rotations for clients in each cabin.

4. **Output**:
   - Writes the total income, the order of client exits, and the final cabin number to `roata.out`.

This solution ensures the loop exits correctly once all clients have been processed and no active clients remain on the wheel, thus avoiding infinite loops and excessive memory usage.
