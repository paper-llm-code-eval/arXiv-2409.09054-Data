Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

Let's evaluate the differences between the expected and found results and understand why there is a discrepancy in the number of sequences with a sum divisible by \( k \).

### Explanation of Differences:
1. The part (a) of the problem, which is finding the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences, seems to be correct.
2. The issue lies in part (b). The discrepancy arises in counting the number of sequences with a sum divisible by \( k \). The current dynamic programming approach accumulates more sequences than expected because it counts subsequences where elements are not necessarily consecutive.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug for part (b), we need to ensure we count only sequences (consecutive elements) whose sum is divisible by \( k \). The current approach does not differentiate between subsequences and sequences.

We'll employ a different strategy for part (b):
1. Use a sliding window dynamic programming approach to consider only sequences with consecutive elements.

Here is the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part (a): Minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        *lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), S[i]) = S[i];
    }
    int num_inc_subseq = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), INT_MAX) - dp.begin();
    
    // Part (b): Number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    int num_sequences = 0;
    for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
            sum += S[end];
            if (sum % k == 0) {
                num_sequences = (num_sequences + 1) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << num_inc_subseq << "\n" << num_sequences << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Part (a):** The logic for finding the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences remains unchanged and is correct.
2. **Part (b):** 
   - We iterate through each possible starting point of a sequence.
   - For each starting point, we iterate through each possible ending point, forming a sequence of consecutive elements.
   - We maintain a running sum of the sequence and increment the count if the running sum is divisible by \( k \).
   - This ensures only sequences with consecutive elements are considered, fixing the over-counting issue.

This approach ensures the solution is both correct and efficient given the problem constraints.

The error message indicates that `INT_MAX` was not declared in the scope because the `<climits>` header was not included. This header is necessary for using constants like `INT_MAX`.

Let's fix the program by including the `<climits>` header and ensure the entire solution compiles and runs correctly.

Here is the corrected and complete solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part (a): Minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        *lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), S[i]) = S[i];
    }
    int num_inc_subseq = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), INT_MAX) - dp.begin();
    
    // Part (b): Number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    int num_sequences = 0;
    for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
            sum += S[end];
            if (sum % k == 0) {
                num_sequences = (num_sequences + 1) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << num_inc_subseq << "\n" << num_sequences << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Header Inclusion:** The `<climits>` header is included to make use of `INT_MAX`.
2. **Part (a):** The logic to find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences remains the same.
3. **Part (b):** The corrected logic to count the number of sequences with a sum divisible by \( k \) is applied.

It seems that the provided solution actually produces the correct output, as the found output matches the expected output. However, there might be some confusion in the explanation provided in the prompt.

Let's summarize the correct approach and ensure the solution is clean and optimal.

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **Part (a): Minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences**
   - We use a dynamic programming approach with a vector `dp` initialized to `INT_MAX`. For each element in the sequence, we find the lower bound in `dp` and replace it with the current element.
   - The length of the longest increasing subsequence is then determined by finding the first occurrence of `INT_MAX` in `dp`.

2. **Part (b): Number of sequences with sum divisible by `k`**
   - We use a nested loop to consider all possible subarrays (sequences of consecutive elements). We maintain a running sum and check if it is divisible by `k`. If it is, we increment the count.

### Correct Solution Code:

Here is the correct implementation as provided:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part (a): Minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        *lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), S[i]) = S[i];
    }
    int num_inc_subseq = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), INT_MAX) - dp.begin();
    
    // Part (b): Number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    int num_sequences = 0;
    for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
            sum += S[end];
            if (sum % k == 0) {
                num_sequences = (num_sequences + 1) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << num_inc_subseq << "\n" << num_sequences << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary:
- The solution provided correctly calculates the number of strictly increasing subsequences and the number of sequences with sums divisible by `k`.
- The found output matches the expected output.
- Ensure the test input is used correctly and the output matches the expected values. If there are different test cases or additional constraints, they should be tested similarly.

With this correct approach, the solution should consistently provide the expected results for given inputs.

Given that the program correctly produced the expected output for the provided input, the task now is to re-evaluate if the solution is optimal and robust for all potential edge cases.

We need to ensure that the solution handles larger inputs efficiently, given the constraints mentioned in the problem. We will recheck both parts of the solution:

1. **Part (a) - Minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences**: This part appears to be correct and efficient.
2. **Part (b) - Number of sequences with sum divisible by `k`**: The nested loops approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which might be suboptimal for larger inputs (close to the upper limit of \(n = 100000\)).

### Optimizing Part (b):

To count the number of sequences with sums divisible by `k`, we can use a more optimized approach with prefix sums and modular arithmetic. This approach will reduce the time complexity to \(O(n)\).

Here’s how the optimized approach works:
1. Use a prefix sum array to maintain the sum of elements up to the current index.
2. Calculate the prefix sum modulo `k` and use a hash map to count the occurrences of each modulo value.
3. If the current prefix sum modulo `k` is 0, it means the sequence from the start to the current index is divisible by `k`.
4. For each prefix sum modulo `k`, if it has been seen before, it means there are sequences between the previous occurrences and the current index that are divisible by `k`.

Here is the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part (a): Minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        *lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), S[i]) = S[i];
    }
    int num_inc_subseq = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), INT_MAX) - dp.begin();
    
    // Part (b): Number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    int num_sequences = 0;
    vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);
    unordered_map<int, int> mod_count;

    mod_count[0] = 1; // To handle the case when prefix_sum % k == 0

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i] = (prefix_sum[i-1] + S[i-1]) % k;
        if (prefix_sum[i] < 0) prefix_sum[i] += k;

        num_sequences = (num_sequences + mod_count[prefix_sum[i]]) % MOD;
        mod_count[prefix_sum[i]]++;
    }

    outfile << num_inc_subseq << "\n" << num_sequences << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Optimized Solution:
1. **Part (a)**: The solution for finding the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences remains unchanged.
2. **Part (b)**: 
   - The prefix sum array `prefix_sum` maintains the cumulative sum of elements up to the current index, modulo `k`.
   - The hash map `mod_count` keeps track of how many times each modulo value has appeared.
   - For each element, we update the count of sequences whose sums are divisible by `k` by adding the current count of the prefix sum's modulo value.
   - This approach effectively computes the result in a linear pass through the array, making it more efficient for larger inputs.

This solution should now be both correct and efficient, and it should handle large input sizes within the given constraints.

Given that the solution is producing the correct results and matches the expected output for the provided input, the issue seems to be a miscommunication regarding the evaluation differences. The solution is working as expected for the given example. However, let's ensure that the solution is robust and correct for other inputs as well.

Let's break down the solution again to make sure there are no hidden issues:

### Part (a): Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences
The solution uses an efficient dynamic programming approach with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is optimal for this problem size.

### Part (b): Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by `k`
The solution uses a prefix sum with modular arithmetic and a hash map to count the number of valid sequences, which reduces the problem to \(O(n)\) time complexity.

The solution implementation should be correct. Let's re-implement the final combined solution to ensure clarity and correctness.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part (a): Minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        *lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), S[i]) = S[i];
    }
    int num_inc_subseq = lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), INT_MAX) - dp.begin();
    
    // Part (b): Number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    int num_sequences = 0;
    vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);
    unordered_map<int, int> mod_count;

    mod_count[0] = 1; // To handle the case when prefix_sum % k == 0

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i] = (prefix_sum[i-1] + S[i-1]) % k;
        if (prefix_sum[i] < 0) prefix_sum[i] += k;

        num_sequences = (num_sequences + mod_count[prefix_sum[i]]) % MOD;
        mod_count[prefix_sum[i]]++;
    }

    outfile << num_inc_subseq << "\n" << num_sequences << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Part (a)**: 
   - The `dp` array is used to keep track of the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths. The use of `lower_bound` ensures that the algorithm runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is determined by the number of valid entries in the `dp` array.

2. **Part (b)**: 
   - The `prefix_sum` array stores cumulative sums modulo `k`.
   - The `mod_count` hash map keeps track of how many times each modulo value has been encountered.
   - For each element, the algorithm checks the current prefix sum modulo `k`. If it has been seen before, it means there are sequences between the previous occurrence(s) and the current index that are divisible by `k`.
   - This ensures that the algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time.

This solution is correct and should compile and run efficiently for the given problem constraints. The results should be consistent with the correct output for all valid inputs.

Given the output matched the expected result in your latest request, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need to ensure the solution is robust and clear. The solution appears to produce the correct results for the given input. 

Let's make sure the solution is clear and verify the correctness once more:

### Part (a): Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences
This part uses a dynamic programming approach with a binary search to maintain a list of the smallest possible end elements for increasing subsequences of different lengths. The length of this list at the end represents the number of such subsequences.

### Part (b): Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by `k`
An optimized approach uses prefix sums and a hash map to count the number of valid sequences whose sums are divisible by `k`.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read `n` (number of elements) and `k`.
   - Read the sequence `S` of `n` natural numbers.

2. **Part (a): Determining the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences**
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` initialized with `INT_MAX`.
   - For each element in `S`, find its position in `dp` using `lower_bound` and replace the value at that position.
   - The length of the valid part of `dp` (until `INT_MAX` starts) is the number of subsequences.

3. **Part (b): Counting sequences with sum divisible by `k`**
   - Use a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` to store cumulative sums modulo `k`.
   - Use a hash map `mod_count` to count occurrences of each prefix sum modulo value.
   - For each element, update the prefix sum and check the hash map to count valid sequences.
   - Increment the count in the hash map for the current prefix sum modulo value.

4. **Output Results:**
   - Write the results for both parts to the output file.

### Conclusion:
- The solution should be correct and efficient for the provided constraints.
- The output should match the expected results for the given example.

If there are still concerns regarding the correctness of the solution, you might verify it against additional test cases or edge cases to ensure robustness.
