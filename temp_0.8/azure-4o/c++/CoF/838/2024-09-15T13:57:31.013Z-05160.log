Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To address the programming challenge, we need to solve two problems:

1. Determine the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences needed to partition the sequence.
2. Calculate the number of consecutive subsequences whose sum is divisible by `k`.

### Problem (a): Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences

This problem is akin to finding the [Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)] and using it to determine the minimum number of increasing subsequences. The idea is based on the fact that the minimum number of increasing subsequences required to partition the sequence is equal to the length of the sequence minus the length of the LIS.

### Problem (b): Number of Consecutive Subsequences With Sum Divisible by k

To solve this, we can use a prefix sum array and a hash map to count the number of valid subsequences. The key observation is that if the difference between two prefix sums is divisible by `k`, then the elements between those two positions form a subsequence whose sum is divisible by `k`.

Here's the optimized C++ code implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 20011

using namespace std;

// Function to find the minimum number of increasing subsequences
int min_increasing_subsequences(vector<int>& S, int n) {
    vector<int> lis;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto it = upper_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), S[i]);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(S[i]);
        } else {
            *it = S[i];
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

// Function to count subsequences divisible by k
int count_subsequences_divisible_by_k(vector<int>& S, int n, int k) {
    vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);
    unordered_map<int, int> mod_count;
    mod_count[0] = 1;  // There's one empty subsequence with sum 0
    
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + S[i]) % k;
        if (prefix_sum[i + 1] < 0) {
            prefix_sum[i + 1] += k;
        }
        if (mod_count.find(prefix_sum[i + 1]) != mod_count.end()) {
            count = (count + mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]) % MOD;
        }
        mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("calcule.in");
    ofstream fout("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> S[i];
    }

    int result_a = n - min_increasing_subsequences(S, n);
    int result_b = count_subsequences_divisible_by_k(S, n, k);

    fout << result_a << "\n";
    fout << result_b << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: We use file streams `ifstream` and `ofstream` to read input from `calcule.in` and write output to `calcule.out`, respectively.
2. **Minimum Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a vector to maintain the end elements of each increasing subsequence found so far.
   - By using `upper_bound`, we determine the position where the current element should go to either extend an existing subsequence or start a new one.
3. **Count Subsequences Divisible by k**:
   - We maintain a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums modulo `k`.
   - An unordered map (`mod_count`) keeps track of how many times each modulo value has been encountered.
   - For each prefix sum, we calculate the number of valid subsequences that end at the current position and have a sum divisible by `k`.

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided, ensuring quick execution for large inputs.

Upon reviewing the issue, I realized that the approach for determining the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences was incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and then partitioning the array into subsequences based on the LIS.

Here's the revised solution:

1. **Problem (a): Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**
   - The correct approach uses the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) but not for the length as in the previous attempt.
   - We need to use a greedy algorithm where each element is placed in the right subsequence.

2. **Problem (b): Number of Consecutive Subsequences With Sum Divisible by k**
   - This part of the solution remains the same.

Here is the updated C++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 20011

using namespace std;

int calculate_min_subsequences(const vector<int>& S, int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    vector<int> tails;
    for (int x : S) {
        auto it = upper_bound(tails.begin(), tails.end(), x);
        if (it == tails.end()) {
            tails.push_back(x);
        } else {
            *it = x;
        }
    }
    return tails.size();
}

int count_divisible_subsequences(const vector<int>& S, int n, int k) {
    vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);
    unordered_map<int, int> mod_count;
    mod_count[0] = 1;
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + S[i]) % k;
        if (prefix_sum[i + 1] < 0) {
            prefix_sum[i + 1] += k;
        }
        if (mod_count.find(prefix_sum[i + 1]) != mod_count.end()) {
            count = (count + mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]) % MOD;
        }
        mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("calcule.in");
    ofstream fout("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> S[i];
    }

    int result_a = calculate_min_subsequences(S, n);
    int result_b = count_divisible_subsequences(S, n, k);

    fout << result_a << "\n";
    fout << result_b << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: We use file streams `ifstream` and `ofstream` to read input from `calcule.in` and write output to `calcule.out`, respectively.
2. **Minimum Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a greedy algorithm where each element is placed in the right subsequence.
   - `upper_bound` helps to find the right position to place the current element.
   - The size of the `tails` vector gives the number of such subsequences.
3. **Count Subsequences Divisible by k**:
   - This part of the solution remains the same as the previous attempt.

This should now provide the correct results for both parts of the problem.

Upon further examination, I identified the error in the approach to solving the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences. The previous approach incorrectly calculated the number of strictly increasing subsequences.

To correctly solve for the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences, we need to use a different approach. Specifically, we should use a greedy algorithm with patience sorting, where:
1. We use a list of piles each representing the top elements of increasing subsequences.
2. For each element in the sequence, place it on the leftmost pile that has a top element greater than or equal to the current element. If no such pile exists, start a new pile.

This effectively translates to finding the length of the longest decreasing subsequence.

Let's fix the code accordingly.

### Revised C++ Code

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 20011

using namespace std;

// Function to find the minimum number of increasing subsequences
int min_increasing_subsequences(const vector<int>& S, int n) {
    vector<int> piles;
    for (int x : S) {
        auto it = upper_bound(piles.begin(), piles.end(), x);
        if (it == piles.begin()) {
            piles.insert(piles.begin(), x);
        } else {
            *(it - 1) = x;
        }
    }
    return piles.size();
}

// Function to count subsequences divisible by k
int count_subsequences_divisible_by_k(const vector<int>& S, int n, int k) {
    vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);
    unordered_map<int, int> mod_count;
    mod_count[0] = 1;  // There's one empty subsequence with sum 0
    
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + S[i]) % k;
        if (prefix_sum[i + 1] < 0) {
            prefix_sum[i + 1] += k;
        }
        if (mod_count.find(prefix_sum[i + 1]) != mod_count.end()) {
            count = (count + mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]) % MOD;
        }
        mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {

    int result_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S, n);

    fout << result_b << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}

### Explanation:
1. **Minimum Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a greedy approach where each element is placed in the right subsequence.
   - Using `upper_bound` to find the appropriate pile (subsequence) for each element.

Upon careful review, I identified that the implementation for determining the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences needs correction. The correct approach involves using a patience sorting algorithm. For each element, place it on the leftmost pile that has a top element greater than or equal to the current element. If no such pile exists, start a new pile. The number of piles will be the answer.

Additionally, we need to address the issue in the `upper_bound` usage and fix the placement in piles. Let's correct the approach:

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
   - Use patience sorting to place each element in the correct pile.
   - The number of piles represents the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences.

2. **Count of Subarrays with Sum Divisible by k**:
   - This remains the same as it was correct in the previous implementation.

        } else {

The issue with our previous approach for the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences lies in the application of the patience sorting algorithm. We should clarify the requirement: the goal is to partition the array into the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences. This can be achieved using a greedy approach by assigning each number to its appropriate subsequence.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct approach to solve both parts of the problem:

1. **Minimizing the Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We need to place each element in the correct subsequence using the patience sorting technique correctly.

2. **Counting Subsequences with Sum Divisible by k**:
   - This part remains the same as it was correctly implemented.

### Corrected Approach in C++

Here's the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

    vector<int> ends;
    for (int x : S) {
        auto it = upper_bound(ends.begin(), ends.end(), x);
        if (it == ends.end()) {
            ends.push_back(x);
        } else {
            *it = x;
        }
    }
    return ends.size();
}

// Function to count subsequences divisible by k
int count_subsequences_divisible_by_k(const vector<int>& S, int n, int k) {

        if (prefix_sum[i + 1] < 0) {
            prefix_sum[i + 1] += k;
        }
        if (mod_count.find(prefix_sum[i + 1]) != mod_count.end()) {
            count = (count + mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]) % MOD;
        }
        mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]++;

    fout << result_b << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Minimum Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a vector `ends` to maintain the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences found so far.
   - For each element in the sequence, we use `upper_bound` to find the position in `ends` where this element could replace an existing end (to extend the subsequence) or add a new subsequence if it cannot extend any.
   - The size of `ends` eventually gives us the number of strictly increasing subsequences.

2. **Count Subsequences Divisible by k**:
   - This part remains unchanged because it was already correctly implemented.

This revised solution should now provide the correct results for both parts of the problem.

The discrepancy in the results for the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences arises from the misunderstanding of how to partition the sequence efficiently. The correct approach involves using a more direct greedy method that considers each element in the sequence and places it in a subsequence that can be extended or starts a new subsequence if none can be extended.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
   - Use a greedy approach to partition the sequence. We traverse the sequence and maintain a list of the smallest end elements of all active subsequences.
   - For each element in the sequence, try to place it in an existing subsequence that can be extended. If no such subsequence exists, start a new one.
   - The number of active subsequences at the end gives the required result.

2. **Number of Subarrays with Sum Divisible by k**:
   - This remains the same as before, using prefix sums and a hash map.

### Revised Solution in C++

Here's the corrected and final implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

#define MOD 20011

using namespace std;

// Function to find the minimum number of increasing subsequences

### Explanation:
1. **Minimum Increasing Subsequences**:
   - The vector `piles` maintains the smallest possible end elements of all active subsequences.
   - For each element in `S`, use `lower_bound` to find the first subsequence that can be extended by the element. If none exists, start a new subsequence.
   - The size of `piles` will be the number of strictly increasing subsequences required.

2. **Count Subsequences Divisible by k**:
   - This part remains unchanged as it was already correct.
   - We use prefix sums and a hash map to count the number of valid subsequences effectively.

By carefully implementing the greedy approach for partitioning the sequence into strictly increasing subsequences and maintaining the correct technique for counting valid subsequences, this solution should now provide the correct results for both parts of the problem.

The output now matches the expected result, which indicates that the previous solution is performing correctly. Let’s evaluate why it works and confirm its correctness.

### Explanation and Evaluation:

1. **Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
    - **Correct Approach**: The algorithm uses a greedy method where each element in the sequence is placed in the first available subsequence that can accept it (i.e., it can extend the subsequence). If no such subsequence exists, a new subsequence is started.
    - **Implementation**: This is achieved by maintaining a vector `piles` where each element represents the end of a subsequence. The element is positioned using `lower_bound` to find the first position where it can be placed or replacing an existing end element to maintain the smallest possible end.
    - **Correctness**: The size of `piles` at the end of the operation represents the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences needed to partition the array.

2. **Number of Subarrays with Sum Divisible by k**:
    - **Correct Approach**: This problem is efficiently solved using a prefix sum array and a hash map to count the occurrences of sums modulo `k`.
    - **Implementation**: For each prefix sum, calculate its modulo `k` value and maintain a count of how many times each modulo value has been seen. This allows for counting valid subarrays whose sums are divisible by `k`.
    - **Correctness**: By maintaining the counts and using the properties of modular arithmetic, the correct number of valid subarrays is computed.

With both parts of the problem addressed correctly and the outputs matching the expected results, let’s ensure the solution is properly formatted and optimized for clarity.

#include <unordered_map>

#define MOD 20011

using namespace std;

// Function to find the minimum number of increasing subsequences

    for (int x : S) {
        auto it = lower_bound(piles.begin(), piles.end(), x);
        if (it == piles.end()) {
            piles.push_back(x);
        } else {
            *it = x;
        }
    }
    return piles.size();
}

    mod_count[0] = 1;  // There's one empty subsequence with sum 0
    
    int count = 0;

        prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + S[i]) % k;
        if (prefix_sum[i + 1] < 0) {
            prefix_sum[i + 1] += k;
        }
        if (mod_count.find(prefix_sum[i + 1]) != mod_count.end()) {
            count = (count + mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]) % MOD;
        }
        mod_count[prefix_sum[i + 1]]++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("calcule.in");
    ofstream fout("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> S[i];
    }

    int result_a = min_increasing_subsequences(S, n);
    int result_b = count_subsequences_divisible_by_k(S, n, k);

    fout << result_a << "\n";
    fout << result_b << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation Recap:
1. **Minimum Increasing Subsequences**:
    - The vector `piles` maintains the smallest possible end elements of all active subsequences.
    - Use `lower_bound` to place each element in the appropriate subsequence or start a new one.
    - The size of `piles` at the end gives the required number of subsequences.

2. **Count Subsequences Divisible by k**:
    - Use prefix sums and a hash map to efficiently count the number of valid subsequences.
    - Maintain counts of prefix sums modulo `k` to find subarrays with sums divisible by `k`.

This solution addresses the challenge efficiently and correctly, providing the correct results for both parts.
