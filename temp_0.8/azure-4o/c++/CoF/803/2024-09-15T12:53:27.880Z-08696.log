Ilinca este o fetiţă căreia îi place foarte mult să deseneze; ea a făcut multe desene pe care le-a numerotat de la $1$ la $d$ şi apoi le-a multiplicat (toate copiile poartă acelaşi număr ca şi originalul după care au fost făcute). În vacanţă s-a hotărât să-şi deschidă propria expoziţie pe gardul bunicilor care are mai multe scânduri; pe fiecare scândură ea aşează o planşă (un desen original sau o copie). Ilinca ţine foarte mult la desenele ei şi doreşte ca fiecare desen să apară de cel puţin $k$ ori (folosind originalul şi copiile acestuia). Ilinca se întreabă în câte moduri ar putea aranja expoziţia. Două moduri de aranjare sunt considerate distincte dacă diferă cel puţin prin numărul unei planşe (de exemplu: $2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 3$ este aceeaşi expoziţie ca şi $2 \ 3 \ 1 \ 3$, dar este diferită de $2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 1$ şi de $1 \ 3 \ 3 \ 1$).

# Cerinţă

Cunoscând $n$ numărul de scânduri din gard, $d$ numărul desenelor originale şi $k$ numărul minim de apariţii al fiecărui desen, să se determine în câte moduri poate fi aranjată expoziţia, ştiind că Ilinca are la dispoziţie oricâte copii doreşte.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `expozitie.in` va conţine $3$ numere, $n \ d \ k$ - numărul de scânduri, numărul desenelor originale, respectiv numărul minim de aparţii.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `expozitie.out` va conţine un singur număr, $nr$, numărul modurilor distincte de aranjare a expoziţiei.


# Restricții și precizări

* $n,k,d$ sunt numere naturale
* $1 \leq n \leq 500$
* $1 \leq d \leq 500$
* $0 \leq k \leq n$

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct ways to arrange `d` different drawings on `n` boards, such that each drawing appears at least `k` times. 

Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We have `n` boards, `d` different drawings, and each drawing must appear at least `k` times.
   - This implies we must place each drawing `k` times on the boards and then we can freely place the remaining boards.

2. **Combinatorial Perspective**:
   - We start by ensuring each drawing appears `k` times. This consumes `d * k` boards.
   - The remaining boards are `n - d * k` which can be freely filled with any of the `d` drawings.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Ensure `d * k <= n` otherwise it's impossible to place all drawings `k` times.

4. **Calculating the Number of Ways**:
   - The number of ways to place the `d * k` drawings is the multinomial coefficient `n! / (k! * k! * ... * k!)` where `k!` repeats `d` times.
   - The remaining `n - d * k` boards can be filled in `d^(n - d * k)` ways.

Here's the C++ code to implement this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the boards
long long countWays(int n, int d, int k) {
    if (d * k > n) return 0; // If it's impossible to place each drawing at least k times
    
    long long ways = factorial(n);
    long long denominator = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
        denominator *= factorial(k);
    }
    ways /= denominator;
    ways *= pow(d, n - d * k);
    
    return ways;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("expozitie.in");
    ofstream outFile("expozitie.out");
    
    int n, d, k;
    inFile >> n >> d >> k;
    
    long long result = countWays(n, d, k);
    outFile << result << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The `factorial` function computes the factorial of a number, which is essential for calculating permutations and combinations.

2. **Count Ways**:
   - We first check if arranging `d` drawings each `k` times is possible.
   - If it's impossible, we return 0.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the number of ways using the multinomial coefficient and multiply by `d^(remaining boards)`.

3. **Reading and Writing Files**:
   - We read input from `expozitie.in` and write the output in `expozitie.out`.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the given constraints.

The error message indicates that the `pow` function was not recognized. This typically happens because the `cmath` library, which contains the `pow` function, has not been included. Additionally, since we are dealing with integer exponentiation, we might as well define a custom function to handle this. Here is the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath> // Include cmath for pow function

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Custom function to calculate power for integer base and exponent
long long intPow(int base, int exp) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < exp; i++) {
        result *= base;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the boards
long long countWays(int n, int d, int k) {
    if (d * k > n) return 0; // If it's impossible to place each drawing at least k times
    
    long long ways = factorial(n);
    long long denominator = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
        denominator *= factorial(k);
    }
    ways /= denominator;
    ways *= intPow(d, n - d * k);
    
    return ways;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("expozitie.in");
    ofstream outFile("expozitie.out");
    
    int n, d, k;
    inFile >> n >> d >> k;
    
    long long result = countWays(n, d, k);
    outFile << result << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Include `<cmath>`**:
   - Added `#include <cmath>` at the top to provide the `pow` function.

2. **Custom Power Function**:
   - Defined `intPow` function to calculate the power for integers directly, avoiding potential issues with floating-point arithmetic when using `pow`.

3. **Usage of `intPow`**:
   - Replaced the call to `pow` with `intPow` in the `countWays` function.

This should now correctly compile and run, providing the correct number of distinct ways to arrange the drawings on the boards.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the approach to the problem may be incorrect. Upon closer inspection, the problem can be tackled using combinatorics in a more straightforward manner by leveraging permutations and combinations.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Permutation Calculation**:
   - We need to place each drawing `k` times. This consumes `d * k` boards.
   - The remaining `n - d * k` boards can be freely filled with any of the `d` drawings.
   - We need to count the number of distinct permutations where each drawing appears at least `k` times.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - Choose `d * k` positions out of `n` for the fixed placements of the drawings.
   - Permute the remaining drawings in the remaining positions.

### Correct Approach:
1. Compute the number of ways to place exactly `k` of each drawing in `d * k` positions.
2. Multiply by the number of ways to arrange the remaining `n - d * k` positions.

### Implementation:
This implementation uses combinatorial mathematics to compute the required number of arrangements.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate combinations (n choose k)
long long comb(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n) return 0;
    if (k == 0 || k == n) return 1;
    k = min(k, n - k); // take advantage of symmetry
    long long c = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1);
    }
    return c;
}

// Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the boards
long long countWays(int n, int d, int k) {
    if (d * k > n) return 0; // If it's impossible to place each drawing at least k times
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to choose d*k positions out of n
    long long ways = comb(n, d * k);
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to place the remaining n - d*k positions
    long long remainingWays = pow(d, n - d * k);
    
    // Since each of the d drawings need to appear k times in the first d*k positions,
    // we must divide by the factorial of k for each drawing
    long long divisor = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < d; ++i) {
        divisor *= factorial(k);
    }
    
    // The total number of ways is the product of the ways to choose positions,
    // the ways to permute the remaining positions, and divide by the number of indistinguishable permutations
    return ways * remainingWays / divisor;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("expozitie.in");
    ofstream outFile("expozitie.out");
    
    int n, d, k;
    inFile >> n >> d >> k;
    
    long long result = countWays(n, d, k);
    outFile << result << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The `factorial` function computes the factorial of a number, which is used for calculating permutations.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The `comb` function calculates combinations (`n choose k`), which determines the number of ways to choose positions.

3. **Count Ways**:
   - First, compute the number of ways to choose `d * k` positions out of `n`.
   - Calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining `n - d * k` positions.
   - Compute the divisor to handle the indistinguishable permutations of repeated elements.
   - Calculate the total number of ways using the product of combinations and remaining permutations, divided by the divisor.

This implementation should now match the expected results given the constraints and the problem description.

The error in the program is due to the `pow` function being used without including the `<cmath>` library. Additionally, since we are dealing with integer exponentiation, we can implement our own power function to avoid potential floating-point inaccuracies.

Here is the corrected version of the program with the necessary adjustments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate combinations (n choose k)
long long comb(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n) return 0;
    if (k == 0 || k == n) return 1;

    long long c = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1);
    }
    return c;
}

// Custom function to calculate power for integer base and exponent
long long intPow(int base, int exp) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < exp; ++i) {
        result *= base;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the boards
long long countWays(int n, int d, int k) {
    if (d * k > n) return 0; // If it's impossible to place each drawing at least k times
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to choose d*k positions out of n
    long long ways = comb(n, d * k);
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to place the remaining n - d*k positions
    long long remainingWays = intPow(d, n - d * k);
    
    // Since each of the d drawings need to appear k times in the first d*k positions,
    // we must divide by the factorial of k for each drawing
    long long divisor = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < d; ++i) {
        divisor *= factorial(k);
    }
    
    // The total number of ways is the product of the ways to choose positions,
    // the ways to permute the remaining positions, and divide by the number of indistinguishable permutations
    return ways * remainingWays / divisor;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("expozitie.in");
    ofstream outFile("expozitie.out");
    
    int n, d, k;
    inFile >> n >> d >> k;
    
    long long result = countWays(n, d, k);
    outFile << result << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Custom Power Function**:
   - Defined the `intPow` function to calculate the power for integers directly, avoiding issues with the `pow` function from `<cmath>`.

2. **Combination and Factorial**:
   - Utilized the `comb` function to calculate combinations and the `factorial` function to handle permutations.

3. **Count Ways**:
   - Used combinatorial mathematics to compute the required number of arrangements.

This solution should now compile correctly and produce the expected results.

To better understand the discrepancy between the expected and found results, let's re-evaluate the problem and the solution approach. 

Given:
- `n` is the number of boards.
- `d` is the number of distinct drawings.
- `k` is the minimum number of times each drawing must appear.

We need to find the number of distinct ways to arrange these drawings on the boards such that each drawing appears at least `k` times.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Minimum Placement**:
   - Each of the `d` drawings must appear at least `k` times. Therefore, `d * k` boards are already consumed.
   - The remaining `n - d * k` boards can be filled with any of the `d` drawings.

2. **Calculation Steps**:
   - Choose `d * k` positions from `n` for placing each drawing `k` times.
   - Calculate the arrangements of the remaining `n - d * k` positions with `d` options per position.

### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the number of ways to place exactly `k` of each drawing in `d * k` positions.
2. Calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining `n - d * k` positions.
3. Divide by the permutations of the `k` repetitions for each drawing.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct combinatorial logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate combinations (n choose k)
long long comb(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n) return 0;
    if (k == 0 || k == n) return 1;
    k = min(k, n - k); // take advantage of symmetry
    long long c = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1);
    }
    return c;
}

// Custom function to calculate power for integer base and exponent
long long intPow(int base, int exp) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < exp; ++i) {
        result *= base;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the boards
long long countWays(int n, int d, int k) {
    if (d * k > n) return 0; // If it's impossible to place each drawing at least k times
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to choose d*k positions out of n
    long long ways = factorial(n) / (factorial(d * k) * factorial(n - d * k));
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to place the remaining n - d*k positions
    long long remainingWays = intPow(d, n - d * k);
    
    // Since each of the d drawings need to appear k times in the first d*k positions,
    // we must divide by the factorial of k for each drawing
    long long divisor = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < d; ++i) {
        divisor *= factorial(k);
    }
    
    // The total number of ways is the product of the ways to choose positions,
    // the ways to permute the remaining positions, and divide by the number of indistinguishable permutations
    return ways * remainingWays / divisor;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("expozitie.in");
    ofstream outFile("expozitie.out");
    
    int n, d, k;
    inFile >> n >> d >> k;
    
    long long result = countWays(n, d, k);
    outFile << result << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

The discrepancy seems to lie in misunderstanding the problem constraints and how to handle the placement of drawings. The issue comes from counting permutations and combinations incorrectly, as we need to ensure each drawing appears at least `k` times and account for permutations within those constraints.

Let's reanalyze the problem:
- Given `n` boards, `d` drawings, and each drawing needs to appear at least `k` times.
- We need to ensure that each drawing appears at least `k` times, and then we need to count the distinct permutations of the boards.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Constraint Check**: If `d * k > n`, it's impossible to place each drawing `k` times, so the result is `0`.
2. **Initial Placement**: Fix `k` appearances for each drawing first.
3. **Remaining Positions**: Fill the remaining `n - d * k` positions with any drawing.
4. **Combinations and Permutations**:
   - Calculate the number of ways to distribute `d * k` fixed placements.
   - Calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining positions with `d` options.
   - Divide by the repetition of `k` for each drawing.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    long long result = 1;

        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate combinations (n choose k)
long long comb(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n) return 0;
    if (k == 0 || k == n) return 1;
    k = min(k, n - k); // take advantage of symmetry
    long long c = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1);
    }
    return c;
}

}

// Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the boards
long long countWays(int n, int d, int k) {
    if (d * k > n) return 0; // If it's impossible to place each drawing at least k times
    
    // Calculate the total number of ways to arrange d indistinguishable groups of size k
    long long ways = factorial(n) / (factorial(d * k) * factorial(n - d * k));
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining n - d*k positions with d different drawings
    long long remainingWays = intPow(d, n - d * k);
    
    // Since each of the d drawings need to appear k times in the first d*k positions,
    // we must divide by the factorial of k for each drawing
    long long divisor = factorial(k);
    for (int i = 1; i < d; ++i) {
        divisor *= factorial(k);
    }
    
    // The total number of ways is the product of the ways to choose positions,
    // the ways to permute the remaining positions, and divide by the number of indistinguishable permutations
    return ways * remainingWays / divisor;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("expozitie.in");
    ofstream outFile("expozitie.out");
    
    int n, d, k;
    inFile >> n >> d >> k;

    outFile << result << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - Used `factorial` to compute permutations.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The `comb` function calculates combinations (`n choose k`).

3. **Custom Power Function**:
   - The `intPow` function calculates the integer power.

4. **Count Ways**:
   - Check if it's possible to place each drawing `k` times.
   - Calculate the number of ways to choose and place `d * k` positions.
   - Calculate the number of remaining ways to fill with `d` options.
   - Compute divisors to handle indistinguishable permutations.
   - Combine all calculations to get the final result.

To address this problem correctly and ensure that the solution matches the expected output, we need to reconsider our approach. The key issue here is correctly accounting for the distinct permutations given the constraints.

### Analysis:
1. **Minimum Requirement**:
   - Each drawing must appear at least `k` times.
   - This consumes `d * k` boards. If `d * k` exceeds `n`, it's impossible to satisfy the constraints.

2. **Remaining Boards**:
   - After placing each drawing `k` times, we are left with `n - d * k` boards. These can be filled with any of the `d` drawings.

3. **Distinct Arrangements**:
   - The number of ways to arrange the boards such that each drawing appears at least `k` times.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Initial Placement**: Fix `k` appearances for each drawing first. This ensures that the minimum requirement is met.
2. **Remaining Positions**: Count the ways to fill the remaining positions with any drawing, then compute the permutations.

Given the constraints and the need to manage distinct permutations, we can simplify the solution by leveraging dynamic programming or combinatorics directly.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the revised implementation using a simpler combinatorial approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial
long long factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Function to calculate combinations (n choose k)
long long comb(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n) return 0;
    if (k == 0 || k == n) return 1;
    long long c = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1);
    }
    return c;
}

// Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the boards
long long countWays(int n, int d, int k) {
    if (d * k > n) return 0; // If it's impossible to place each drawing at least k times
    
    long long result = 1;
    int remaining = n - d * k;
    
    // Number of ways to choose which boards get the initial k copies for each drawing
    result = comb(n, d * k);
    
    // Number of ways to arrange the remaining boards among d drawings
    result *= pow(d, remaining);
    
    // Divide by the factorial of k for each drawing to avoid overcounting permutations
    for (int i = 0; i < d; ++i) {
        result /= factorial(k);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("expozitie.in");
    ofstream outFile("expozitie.out");
    
    int n, d, k;
    inFile >> n >> d >> k;
    
    long long result = countWays(n, d, k);
    outFile << result << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - Used the `factorial` function to compute permutations of repeated elements.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The `comb` function calculates combinations (`n choose k`).

3. **Handling Remaining Boards**:
   - Calculated the number of ways to place remaining boards using exponentiation.

4. **Count Ways**:
   - First, check if it's possible to place each drawing `k` times.
   - Calculate the number of ways to choose `d * k` initial positions.
   - Multiply by the ways to fill remaining positions.
   - Divide by the factorial of `k` for each drawing to correct overcounting.

This solution should now correctly reflect the constraints and produce the expected results.
