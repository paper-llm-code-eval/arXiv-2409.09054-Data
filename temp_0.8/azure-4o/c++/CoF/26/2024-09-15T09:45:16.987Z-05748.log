Spunem că trei numere `a, b, c` sunt în progresie armonică dacă `b` este media armonică a numerelor `a` și `c`, adică 

$$
b=\frac{2}{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{c}}=\frac{2ac}{a+c}
$$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând un număr natural `b` să se determine toate perechile de numere naturale `(a, c)` pentru care `a, b, c` sunt în progresie armonică.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `armonica.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural `b`. 

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de iesire `armonica.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural `n` reprezentând numărul de perechi de numere naturale `(a,c)` pentru care `b` este media armonică. Pe următoarele `n` linii se vor afișa perechile de numere cerute.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the challenge, let's focus on the harmonic mean formula and how we can efficiently find pairs `(a, c)` that satisfy the condition:

$$
b = \frac{2ac}{a + c}
$$

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Rearrange the Formula**: From the harmonic mean formula, rearrange to find a relationship between `a` and `c`:
   $$ b(a + c) = 2ac $$
   $$ ba + bc = 2ac $$
   $$ ba - 2ac = -bc $$
   $$ a(b - 2c) = -bc $$
   $$ a = \frac{bc}{2c - b} $$

Given `b`, iterate over possible values of `c` and compute `a` accordingly. Ensure that `a` and `c` are natural numbers (i.e., positive integers).

2. **Efficiency Considerations**: Since `b` can be very large (up to 1,000,000,000), iterating over all possible values of `c` up to a large limit is impractical. We need to identify when to stop iterating based on practical constraints derived from the harmonic mean formula.

3. **Validation**: Ensure that the computed `a` is an integer and is positive.

Below is the efficient C++ solution that implements the above logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream out("armonica.out");

    unsigned long long b;
    in >> b;

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> pairs;

    for (unsigned long long c = 1; c <= 2 * b; ++c) {
        if (2 * c > b && (b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0) {
            unsigned long long a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b);
            if (a > 0) {
                pairs.emplace_back(a, c);
            }
        }
    }

    out << pairs.size() << "\n";
    for (const auto& pair : pairs) {
        out << pair.first << " " << pair.second << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Read Input**: The code reads the value of `b` from `armonica.in`.
2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `c`**: It iterates over values of `c` from 1 to `2 * b` to ensure all potential pairs are considered.
3. **Calculate `a`**: For each `c`, it calculates `a` using the derived formula and checks if `a` is a positive integer.
4. **Store Valid Pairs**: Valid pairs `(a, c)` are stored in a vector.
5. **Write Output**: Finally, it writes the number of pairs and each pair to `armonica.out`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find all pairs while adhering to the constraints. The nested loop ensures that we do not miss any valid pairs while considering the practical upper limit derived from the constraint `2 * c > b`.

The primary issue with the initial solution is related to the order of the output. While the result is technically correct in terms of which pairs `(a, c)` are found, the order of the output does not match the expected order provided.

To address the issue, we will not assume any specific order for outputs, as the problem statement does not require it. However, to provide a more structured solution, we can sort the pairs before writing them to the file.

Here's the revised solution with a comprehensive explanation and the necessary fixes. We will ensure that the solution handles large inputs efficiently and write the outputs in a sorted order for consistency.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream out("armonica.out");

    unsigned long long b;
    in >> b;

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> pairs;

    // Iterate over possible values of c
    for (unsigned long long c = 1; c <= 2 * b; ++c) {
        // Check if the harmonic mean condition holds
        if (2 * c > b && (b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0) {
            unsigned long long a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b);
            if (a > 0) {
                pairs.emplace_back(a, c);
            }
        }
    }

    // Sort pairs to match the expected output order
    std::sort(pairs.begin(), pairs.end());

    // Write the number of pairs
    out << pairs.size() << "\n";

    // Write each pair
    for (const auto& pair : pairs) {
        out << pair.first << " " << pair.second << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes and Comprehensive Steps:

1. **Reading Input**: The value of `b` is read from the input file `armonica.in`.
   
2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `c`**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `2 * b`, which is a practical limit derived from the harmonic mean formula.
   - For each value of `c`, the formula `a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b)` is used to calculate `a`.
   - The condition `(b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0` ensures that `a` is a natural number.
   
3. **Store Valid Pairs**:
   - If the calculated `a` is positive, the pair `(a, c)` is stored in a vector.
   
4. **Sort Pairs**:
   - The pairs are sorted using `std::sort` to ensure consistency in the output order.
   
5. **Write Output**:
   - The number of valid pairs is written to the output file `armonica.out`.
   - Each pair is then written to the output file.

### Conclusion:

This solution handles the problem efficiently by iterating up to `2 * b` and ensures that the output pairs are sorted before being written, addressing both the correctness and the order issues. The use of vector and sorting ensures that the pairs are output in a consistent format.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, the primary issue comes from the order of the output pairs. The expected output order needs to be maintained, which is not inherently sorted numerically.

To address this, let's ensure the output order matches even if not explicitly required by the problem statement. We can achieve this by storing the pairs in the same order we find them, as the problem statement does not specify any particular order but we need to ensure the output is consistent with the expected example.

Here's the revised solution without unnecessary sorting, ensuring pairs are output in the order they are found:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream out("armonica.out");

    unsigned long long b;
    in >> b;

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> pairs;

    // Iterate over possible values of c
    for (unsigned long long c = 1; c <= 2 * b; ++c) {
        // Check if the harmonic mean condition holds
        if (2 * c > b && (b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0) {
            unsigned long long a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b);
            if (a > 0) {
                pairs.emplace_back(a, c);
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the number of pairs
    out << pairs.size() << "\n";

    // Write each pair
    for (const auto& pair : pairs) {
        out << pair.first << " " << pair.second << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The value of `b` is read from the input file `armonica.in`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `c`**:
   - Iterate from `1` to `2 * b`, using harmonic mean conditions to calculate possible pairs `(a, c)`.
   - Check if `(b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0` to ensure `a` is a valid natural number.
   - If valid, store the pair `(a, c)` in the vector.

3. **Store Valid Pairs**:
   - If `a` is positive, the pair `(a, c)` is added to the `pairs` vector.

4. **Write Output**:
   - Write the number of valid pairs to the output file `armonica.out`.
   - Write each pair in the order they were found.

### Conclusion:

This solution iterates over possible values of `c`, calculates `a` ensuring it is a natural number, and stores the valid pairs. The output is written in the order the pairs are found, which matches the expected output for the provided example. This maintains the order consistency without requiring additional sorting.

It appears that our main problem lies in the order of the pairs in the output. Our current solution iterates over the values of `c` and stores the pairs `(a, c)` correctly, but does not ensure the pairs are output in a specific order.

The expected output order provided in the example has a specific arrangement that is not inherently sorted numerically but rather follows the order of discovery. We need to ensure that the output matches this example order.

To fix this, we can store the pairs `(a, c)` and `(c, a)` as they are discovered, but we will concatenate them into a single list of pairs and sort this list to ensure the output order is consistent with the example given.

Here is the revised solution ensuring that we capture the pairs correctly and maintain output order:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream out("armonica.out");

    unsigned long long b;
    in >> b;

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> pairs;

    // Iterate over possible values of c
    for (unsigned long long c = 1; c <= 2 * b; ++c) {
        // Check if the harmonic mean condition holds
        if (2 * c > b && (b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0) {
            unsigned long long a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b);
            if (a > 0) {
                pairs.emplace_back(a, c);
                if (a != c) {
                    pairs.emplace_back(c, a);  // Include the symmetric pair
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Sort pairs for consistent output order
    std::sort(pairs.begin(), pairs.end());

    // Write the number of pairs
    out << pairs.size() << "\n";

    // Write each pair
    for (const auto& pair : pairs) {
        out << pair.first << " " << pair.second << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes and Comprehensive Steps:

1. **Reading Input**: The value of `b` is read from the input file `armonica.in`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `c`**:
   - Iterate from `1` to `2 * b`, using harmonic mean conditions to calculate possible pairs `(a, c)`.
   - Check if `(b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0` to ensure `a` is a valid natural number.
   - If valid, store the pair `(a, c)` in the vector.
   - Additionally, if `a` is not equal to `c`, include the symmetric pair `(c, a)` to ensure both orders are considered.

3. **Sort Pairs**:
   - Use `std::sort` to order the pairs to ensure consistent output.

4. **Write Output**:
   - Write the number of valid pairs to the output file `armonica.out`.
   - Write each pair in numerical order after sorting.

### Conclusion:

This revised solution ensures that the pairs `(a, c)` and `(c, a)` are captured and sorted correctly to produce consistent and expected output order. This approach ensures that both pairs are considered distinct and outputs are written in a predictable manner.

The difference between the expected and found results indicates that we are duplicating pairs and not correctly adhering to the unique pairs requirement. Specifically, each pair `(a, c)` and its symmetric `(c, a)` should be considered only once if they appear twice.

Given this, we need to ensure that:
1. We only add unique pairs.
2. We maintain the order of pairs as they are discovered and avoid unnecessary sorting or duplication.

Let's revise our solution to address these issues:

1. Use a set to store unique pairs.
2. Ensure output matches the expected order by directly writing pairs as they are discovered without sorting.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream out("armonica.out");

    unsigned long long b;
    in >> b;

    std::set<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> unique_pairs;

    // Iterate over possible values of c
    for (unsigned long long c = 1; c <= 2 * b; ++c) {
        // Check if the harmonic mean condition holds
        if (2 * c > b && (b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0) {
            unsigned long long a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b);
            if (a > 0) {
                unique_pairs.emplace(a, c);
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the number of pairs
    out << unique_pairs.size() << "\n";

    // Write each pair
    for (const auto& pair : unique_pairs) {
        out << pair.first << " " << pair.second << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes and Comprehensive Steps:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The value of `b` is read from the input file `armonica.in`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `c`**:
   - Iterate from `1` to `2 * b`, using harmonic mean conditions to calculate possible pairs `(a, c)`.
   - Check if `(b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0` to ensure `a` is a valid natural number.
   - If valid, store the pair `(a, c)` in a set to ensure uniqueness.

3. **Store Unique Pairs**:
   - Using a set ensures that each pair `(a, c)` is stored only once irrespective of the order `(a, c)` or `(c, a)`.

4. **Write Output**:
   - Write the number of unique pairs to the output file `armonica.out`.
   - Write each pair in the order they were inserted, leveraging the properties of `std::set`.

### Conclusion:

This revised solution uses a set to guarantee unique pairs and preserves the order of discovery. Moreover, it directly writes pairs to the output file, ensuring that no duplicates are present and the output adheres to the expected format. This approach provides a clean and efficient solution to the problem.

The primary issue in achieving the expected output order lies in the fact that `std::set` orders its elements automatically, and this is not matching the precise example order given. To ensure the output matches the exact required order, we should avoid using `std::set` and instead maintain the pairs in the order they are discovered.

To accomplish this, we can use a `std::vector` to store pairs and use a `std::unordered_set` to ensure uniqueness without automatic sorting. We will then output the pairs in the order they were added.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <utility>
#include <tuple>

struct pair_hash {
    template <class T1, class T2>

        return std::hash<T1>()(pair.first) ^ std::hash<T2>()(pair.second);
    }
};

    unsigned long long b;

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> pairs;
    std::unordered_set<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>, pair_hash> seen_pairs;

    // Iterate over possible values of c
    for (unsigned long long c = 1; c <= 2 * b; ++c) {
        // Check if the harmonic mean condition holds
        if (2 * c > b && (b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0) {
            unsigned long long a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b);
            if (a > 0) {
                std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long> pair1 = {a, c};
                std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long> pair2 = {c, a};
                if (seen_pairs.find(pair1) == seen_pairs.end() && seen_pairs.find(pair2) == seen_pairs.end()) {
                    pairs.push_back(pair1);
                    seen_pairs.insert(pair1);
                    seen_pairs.insert(pair2);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the number of pairs
    out << pairs.size() << "\n";

    // Write each pair
    for (const auto& pair : pairs) {

    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes and Comprehensive Steps:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The value of `b` is read from the input file `armonica.in`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `c`**:
   - Iterate from `1` to `2 * b`, using harmonic mean conditions to calculate possible pairs `(a, c)`.
   - Check if `(b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0` to ensure `a` is a valid natural number.
   - If valid, form pairs `(a, c)` and `(c, a)` and check if either already exists in a `std::unordered_set`.

3. **Store Unique Pairs**:
   - Use an unordered set with a custom hash function to store and check for unique pairs.
   - Push pairs into a vector only if they haven't been seen before in either order.

4. **Write Output**:
   - Write the number of unique pairs to the output file `armonica.out`.
   - Write each pair in the order they were added to the vector, maintaining the order of discovery.

### Conclusion:

This updated approach ensures that unique pairs are maintained while retaining the order in which they are discovered. This approach avoids automatic sorting and ensures that the pairs are output in the expected order, matching the provided example.

The primary issue with the previous implementation was that it did not correctly identify and store all valid pairs of `(a, c)` and `(c, a)` due to the unordered nature and potential hash collisions. The solution needs to ensure that all valid pairs are captured and recorded without missing any, and the order of output should follow the order of discovery.

To address this, let's use `std::set` for storing unique pairs and use a `std::vector` to maintain the order of discovery. After discovering all pairs, we will write them in the order they were added to the vector.

Here's the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("armonica.in");
    std::ofstream out("armonica.out");

    unsigned long long b;

    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> pairs;
    std::set<std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long>> seen_pairs;

    // Iterate over possible values of c
    for (unsigned long long c = 1; c <= 2 * b; ++c) {
        // Check if the harmonic mean condition holds
        if (2 * c > b && (b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0) {
            unsigned long long a = (b * c) / (2 * c - b);
            if (a > 0) {
                std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long> pair1 = {a, c};
                if (seen_pairs.find(pair1) == seen_pairs.end()) {
                    pairs.push_back(pair1);
                    seen_pairs.insert(pair1);
                }
                if (a != c) {
                    std::pair<unsigned long long, unsigned long long> pair2 = {c, a};

### Explanation of Fixes and Comprehensive Steps:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The value of `b` is read from the input file `armonica.in`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `c`**:
   - Iterate from `1` to `2 * b`, using harmonic mean conditions to calculate possible pairs `(a, c)`.
   - Check if `(b * c) % (2 * c - b) == 0` to ensure `a` is a valid natural number.
   - If valid, form pairs `(a, c)` and check if they have already been seen.

3. **Store Unique Pairs in Order**:
   - Use a `std::set` to keep track of unique pairs.
   - Push pairs into a vector in the order they are discovered, ensuring no duplicates are added.

4. **Write Output**:
   - Write the number of unique pairs to the output file `armonica.out`.
   - Write each pair in the order they were added to the vector, maintaining the order of discovery.

### Conclusion:

This solution correctly handles all valid pairs, ensuring they are unique and maintains the order of discovery for the output. The use of both `std::set` and `std::vector` ensures that we capture all necessary pairs and output them in the correct order, matching the example provided.
