Se consideră $N$ puncte colorate dispuse în plan. Ele sunt identificate prin coordontele lor întregi, pe axele OX și OY. Fiecare punct are asociat un număr natural între $1$ și $C$ reprezentând codul culorii lui. Un dreptunghi se numește *corect* dacă îndeplinește simultan următoarele condiții:

* toate cele patru vârfuri se regăsesc printre cele N puncte date;
* are laturile paralele cu axele OX, OY;
* are vârfurile colorate în aceeași culoare.

# Cerință

Să se determine numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri *corecte* care se pot forma cu cele $N$ puncte din plan.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.in` se găsesc două numere $N, MaxC$ reprezentând numărul de puncte din plan și numărul de culori asociate punctelor. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se citesc câte trei numere $x \ y \ c$ reprezentând în ordine coordonata pe axa OX (abscisa), coordonata pe axa OY (ordonata) și codul culorii asociate punctului.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.out` se va scrie un singur număr cu semnificația numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri corecte.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, you need to account for the constraints and the specific requirements. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - We need to read the input from a file, `dreptc.in`.
   - The first two integers are `N` (number of points) and `MaxC` (number of colors).
   - The next `N` lines contain three integers each: `x`, `y`, and `c`.

2. **Data Structuring**:
   - Use a map to group points by color. This will allow us to efficiently handle points of the same color together.
   - For each color, store the points in a coordinate-sorted manner to facilitate searching for rectangles.

3. **Rectangle Formation**:
   - For each color, identify pairs of points that can form the diagonals of a rectangle.
   - This condition is satisfied if the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of two points are distinct.
   - Use these pairs to infer potential rectangles and check if the necessary corner points exist.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Since `N` can be up to 1000, we aim for an approach that is roughly O(N^2) per color to stay within feasible limits.

Here is an efficient C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("dreptc.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("dreptc.out");

    int N, MaxC;
    infile >> N >> MaxC;

    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<Point>> colorPoints;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x, y, c;
        infile >> x >> y >> c;
        colorPoints[c].push_back({x, y});
    }

    int maxRectangles = 0;

    for (const auto& [color, points] : colorPoints) {
        int numPoints = points.size();
        std::unordered_map<int, std::set<int>> byX, byY;

        // Group points by x-coordinates and y-coordinates
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            byX[point.x].insert(point.y);
            byY[point.y].insert(point.x);
        }

        // Count rectangles
        for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numPoints; ++j) {
                if (points[i].x != points[j].x && points[i].y != points[j].y) {
                    // Check if the other two corners exist
                    if (byX[points[i].x].count(points[j].y) && byX[points[j].x].count(points[i].y)) {
                        maxRectangles++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Each rectangle is counted 4 times (once per each pair of diagonal points), so divide by 4
    outfile << maxRectangles / 4 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `dreptc.in`.
   - We read `N` and `MaxC`.
   - We read the points and categorize them by color in a `std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<Point>>`.

2. **Data Structuring**:
   - Points are grouped by their color.
   - We use additional maps to organize these points by their x and y coordinates.

3. **Finding Rectangles**:
   - For each pair of points, check if they can form the diagonal of a rectangle.
   - Ensure that the remaining two corners exist by checking our maps.

4. **Output**:
   - We write the result to `dreptc.out`.

This solution efficiently counts all valid rectangles and adheres to the constraints provided. The complexity should be manageable within the provided limits.

The initial solution miscalculates the number of rectangles because it counts each potential rectangle based on distinct x and y coordinates without properly checking all four vertices of the rectangle.

We need to ensure that all four corners of each rectangle are properly checked. Specifically, we need to check for every pair of points if they can be the opposite corners of a rectangle and if the other two corners exist within the set of points for the same color.

Here is a corrected implementation using a slightly different approach, ensuring all conditions are checked properly:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("dreptc.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("dreptc.out");

    int N, MaxC;
    infile >> N >> MaxC;

    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<Point>> colorPoints;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x, y, c;
        infile >> x >> y >> c;
        colorPoints[c].push_back({x, y});
    }

    int maxRectangles = 0;

    for (const auto& [color, points] : colorPoints) {
        int numPoints = points.size();
        std::unordered_set<std::string> pointSet;

        // Store points in a set for quick lookup
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            pointSet.insert(std::to_string(point.x) + "," + std::to_string(point.y));
        }

        // Find pairs of points that can form rectangles
        for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numPoints; ++j) {
                if (points[i].x != points[j].x && points[i].y != points[j].y) {
                    // Check if the other two corners exist
                    std::string corner1 = std::to_string(points[i].x) + "," + std::to_string(points[j].y);
                    std::string corner2 = std::to_string(points[j].x) + "," + std::to_string(points[i].y);
                    if (pointSet.count(corner1) && pointSet.count(corner2)) {
                        maxRectangles++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Each rectangle is counted once accurately
    outfile << maxRectangles << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `dreptc.in`.
   - We read `N` and `MaxC`.
   - We read the points and categorize them by color in a `std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<Point>>`.

I understand the issue with the previous solution. The problem arises from the fact that the solution counts each valid rectangle twice, once for each pair of diagonal points (i, j) and (j, i). To fix this, we'll ensure each rectangle is counted only once.

Additionally, I'll rework the approach to make the algorithm more understandable:

1. Use a hash map to store points by their color.
2. For each color, use nested loops to find valid rectangles.
3. Ensure each rectangle is counted only once.

Here’s the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <tuple>

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("dreptc.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("dreptc.out");

    int N, MaxC;
    infile >> N >> MaxC;

    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<Point>> colorPoints;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x, y, c;
        infile >> x >> y >> c;
        colorPoints[c].push_back({x, y});
    }

    int maxRectangles = 0;

    for (const auto& [color, points] : colorPoints) {
        int numPoints = points.size();
        std::unordered_set<std::string> pointSet;

        // Store points in a set for quick lookup
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            pointSet.insert(std::to_string(point.x) + "," + std::to_string(point.y));
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numPoints; ++j) {
                if (points[i].x != points[j].x && points[i].y != points[j].y) {
                    // Check if the other two corners exist
                    std::string corner1 = std::to_string(points[i].x) + "," + std::to_string(points[j].y);
                    std::string corner2 = std::to_string(points[j].x) + "," + std::to_string(points[i].y);
                    if (pointSet.count(corner1) && pointSet.count(corner2)) {
                        maxRectangles++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Each rectangle was counted twice, so divide by 2
    outfile << maxRectangles / 2 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `dreptc.in`.
   - We read `N` and `MaxC`.
   - We read the points and categorize them by color in a `std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<Point>>`.

2. **Data Structuring**:
   - Points are grouped by their color.
   - We also store the points in a `std::unordered_set<std::string>` to facilitate quick lookup.

3. **Finding Rectangles**:
   - For each pair of points, check if they can form opposite corners of a rectangle.
   - Ensure that the remaining two corners exist by checking our set.
   - Only count each rectangle once by ensuring each pair of diagonal points is considered only once.

4. **Output**:
   - We write the result to `dreptc.out`.

This revised solution should now correctly count the expected number of rectangles, considering each rectangle only once. The main fix was to ensure that we divide the total count by 2 to account for counting each rectangle twice.
