_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp

using namespace std;

// The number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9

    }

    outFile << largestNumber << endl;

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Reading Input:** The input is read from `imprimanta.in` using `ifstream`.
- **Digit Analysis:**
  - The solution converts the number `N` to a string and iterates through each digit.
  - For each digit, it checks the number of points required to print it and compares it to find the digit with the minimal points. The digit with the minimal points is also the largest one in case of a tie.
- **Printing with Exact Points:** 
  - The solution constructs the largest number that can be printed exactly with `K` points. It greedily picks the largest digit that doesn't exceed the remaining points until no more points are left.
- **Writing Output:** The results are written to `imprimanta.out` using `ofstream`.

This approach ensures minimal and efficient operations, fitting the constraints of the challenge perfectly.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated due to excessive memory usage, possibly because of an inefficient algorithm or excessive recursion. Given the constraints, the issue might be with handling large computations.

To resolve this, we can optimize our approach. Here is the fixed solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// The number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9
const int points[10] = { 6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6 };

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream outFile("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    inFile >> N >> K;

    // Determine the largest digit in N with the minimum number of points
    string s = to_string(N);
    int minPoints = INT_MAX;
    int minDigit = -1;

    for (char c : s) {
        int digit = c - '0';
        if (points[digit] < minPoints || (points[digit] == minPoints && digit > minDigit)) {
            minPoints = points[digit];
            minDigit = digit;
        }
    }

    outFile << minDigit << endl;

    // Determine the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
    // To be efficient, we need to use dynamic programming or a greedy approach
    string largestNumber = "";

    // Use a greedy approach for simplicity
    while (K > 0) {
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (K >= points[i]) {
                largestNumber += char('0' + i);
                K -= points[i];
                break;
            }
        }
        // If no digit can be placed, break the loop
        if (largestNumber.empty() || largestNumber.back() == '0') {
            break;
        }
    }

    outFile << largestNumber << endl;

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Memory Optimization:**
   - The loop for determining the largest digit with minimum points is optimized to avoid excessive memory usage.

2. **Efficient Greedy Algorithm:**
   - Uses a greedy approach to construct the largest number that can be printed exactly with `K` points.
   - Iterates from the largest digit to the smallest to maximize the number being constructed.

3. **Check for Infinite Loop:**
   - Added a condition to break the loop if no feasible digit is found, ensuring it doesn't run indefinitely.

This revised solution should be efficient and handle the given constraints effectively.

Exit code 137 is still indicating a problem related to memory usage or execution time. Given the constraints, this might be due to excessive iterations or accumulating too large a string in memory.

To resolve this, we need to ensure our solution efficiently handles large inputs and limits potential memory issues. Here is a refined and optimized version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// The number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9
const int points[10] = { 6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6 };

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream outFile("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    inFile >> N >> K;

    // Determine the largest digit in N with the minimum number of points
    string s = to_string(N);
    int minPoints = INT_MAX;
    int minDigit = -1;

    for (char c : s) {
        int digit = c - '0';
        if (points[digit] < minPoints || (points[digit] == minPoints && digit > minDigit)) {
            minPoints = points[digit];
            minDigit = digit;
        }
    }

    outFile << minDigit << endl;

    // Determine the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
    // Use a vector to store the number in reverse order for efficiency
    vector<int> largestNumber;

    while (K > 0) {
        bool found = false;
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (K >= points[i]) {
                largestNumber.push_back(i);
                K -= points[i];
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            break;
        }
    }

    // Write the largest number in correct order to the file
    for (auto it = largestNumber.rbegin(); it != largestNumber.rend(); ++it) {
        outFile << *it;
    }
    outFile << endl;

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - Using a `vector<int>` to store the digits of the largest number in reverse order to avoid excessive string manipulation.

2. **Efficient Loop Handling:**
   - Added a `found` flag to ensure the loop exits if no feasible digit can be placed, preventing potential infinite loops.

3. **Output Writing:**
   - Writes the largest number in the correct order by iterating through the vector in reverse.

This solution ensures efficient use of memory and handles large inputs more effectively, addressing the potential causes of the previous issues.

It appears the issue is with the algorithm for constructing the largest number with exactly `K` points. The current approach is greedy but doesn't account for the possibility that choosing a larger digit early on might not leave enough points to complete a valid number later.

### Analysis:

- The first part correctly identifies the digit with the minimum points.
- The second part needs a more nuanced approach to ensure that the total points exactly match `K`.

### Steps to Reimplement:
1. **Find the smallest digit using minimal points in `N` correctly (this part is already correct).**
2. **Create a new number using exactly `K` points.**
    - Start by determining how many digits can be constructed with the given points.
    - Ensure the total number of points used equals `K` exactly by backtracking if necessary.

Here is the corrected and reimplemented solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// The number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9
const int points[10] = { 6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6 };

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream outFile("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    inFile >> N >> K;

    // Determine the largest digit in N with the minimum number of points
    string s = to_string(N);
    int minPoints = INT_MAX;
    int minDigit = -1;

    for (char c : s) {
        int digit = c - '0';
        if (points[digit] < minPoints || (points[digit] == minPoints && digit > minDigit)) {
            minPoints = points[digit];
            minDigit = digit;
        }
    }

    outFile << minDigit << endl;

    // Determine the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string largestNumber = "";
    
    int minDigitPoints = *min_element(points, points + 10);
    int numDigits = K / minDigitPoints;

    for (int i = 0; i < numDigits; ++i) {
        largestNumber += '0';
    }

    K -= numDigits * minDigitPoints;

    for (int i = 0; i < numDigits; ++i) {
        for (int d = 9; d >= 0; --d) {
            if (K + minDigitPoints >= points[d]) {
                largestNumber[i] = '0' + d;
                K -= (points[d] - minDigitPoints);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    outFile << largestNumber << endl;

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Calculate Number of Digits:**
   - Compute the maximum number of digits (`numDigits`) that can be printed with the available points (`K`) using the digit with the minimum points.

2. **Initial Fill:**
   - Initialize the number with the smallest digit (`0`) to ensure the maximum length.

3. **Backtrack to Largest:**
   - Adjust each digit in the initialized number from the largest possible value downwards ensuring the total points match `K`.

This approach ensures that the solution constructs the largest possible number under the given constraints, and backtracks properly to ensure the total number of points used is exactly `K`.

The incorrect result arises from a flawed logic in the `largestNumber` construction. Specifically, the approach initializes the number with the minimum possible digits but doesn't correctly adjust these digits to form the largest possible number that uses exactly `K` points. 

To solve this, I will:

1. **Recalculate the entire strategy for constructing the largest number with exactly `K` points.** Instead of initializing with '0' and then adjusting, a better approach would be to build the number from the most significant digit downwards while ensuring the remaining points can still form a valid digit.

2. **Ensure backtracking logic is precise.** If a larger digit can't be used without exceeding `K`, it should use the next possible digit and continue.

Here's the rewritten solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// The number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9
const int points[10] = { 6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6 };

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream outFile("imprimanta.out");

    long long N;
    int K;
    inFile >> N >> K;

    // Determine the largest digit in N with the minimum number of points
    string s = to_string(N);
    int minPoints = INT_MAX;
    int minDigit = -1;

    for (char c : s) {
        int digit = c - '0';
        if (points[digit] < minPoints || (points[digit] == minPoints && digit > minDigit)) {
            minPoints = points[digit];
            minDigit = digit;
        }
    }

    outFile << minDigit << endl;

    // Determine the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string largestNumber = "";
    
    // This time we need to build the number carefully
    while (K > 0) {
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (K >= points[i]) {
                largestNumber += char('0' + i);
                K -= points[i];
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // If the number is malformed (like multiple `0`s), we need to backtrack
    // Ensure the number is the largest possible
    reverse(largestNumber.begin(), largestNumber.end());
    for (int i = largestNumber.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int d = 9; d >= 0; --d) {
            if (points[d] <= points[largestNumber[i] - '0'] + K) {
                K += points[largestNumber[i] - '0'];
                K -= points[d];
                largestNumber[i] = char('0' + d);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the result number reversed back
    reverse(largestNumber.begin(), largestNumber.end());
    outFile << largestNumber << endl;

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **String Construction:** 
   - Construct the number directly from the most significant to the least significant digit while ensuring that the total points used don't exceed `K`.

2. **Backtracking Adjustment:**
   - After constructing the number, a reverse pass ensures that each digit is the largest possible value that still maintains the total points equal to `K`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The constructed number is reversed twice to ensure correct order for final output.

This algorithm should now produce the correct results, adhering to the constraints and problem requirements. Let's test it against the provided example to ensure it works as expected.

The compilation error is due to a missing include directive for `<climits>`, which is required for using `INT_MAX`. Here's the fixed code with the necessary inclusion and some adjustments to ensure correctness:

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Include `<climits>`:**

The persistent exit code 137 indicates a memory or execution time problem. Given that the issue remains even with previous adjustments, it's clear that a more efficient and robust approach is needed.

### Revised Approach:

1. **First Requirement - Finding the Largest Digit with Minimum Points:**
   - This part is straightforward and is already handled correctly.

2. **Second Requirement - Constructing the Largest Number with Exactly K Points:**
   - Instead of directly constructing the number and then adjusting, we can use a more efficient method to build the largest possible number from the start.

3. **Efficient Constructing the Largest Number:**
   - Determine the number of digits that can be constructed with the given points.
   - Use a loop to construct the largest possible number by carefully deciding each digit from left to right.

Here's the fully revised solution:

#include <iostream>

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Efficient Initialization:**
   - Removed unnecessary parts and simplified the logic.

2. **Efficient Number Construction:**
   - The algorithm now directly constructs the number from the highest possible digit to the lowest without intermediate steps that could lead to memory issues.

3. **Corrected `minPoints` Initialization:**
   - Used `numeric_limits<int>::max()` for `minPoints` initialization for better practice.

This approach ensures that the program remains within memory and execution time constraints while correctly solving the problem.
