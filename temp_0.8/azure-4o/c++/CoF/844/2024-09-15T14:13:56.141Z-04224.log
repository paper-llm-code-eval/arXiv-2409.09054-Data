_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

// Array to store the number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9

    max_digits[0] = 0;

    // Determine the maximum number that can be printed with exactly K points

    }
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading the input**: The code reads the input values from the file `imprimanta.in`. It reads the number `N` and the value `K`.
2. **Finding the digit with the minimum points**:
   - Convert the number `N` to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Iterate through each digit of `N` and find the one with the minimum points. If multiple digits have the same minimum points, the largest of them is chosen.
3. **Finding the largest number that can be printed with exactly `K` points**:
   - Use dynamic programming to find the largest number that can be formed using exactly `K` points. `max_digits[i]` stores the largest number that can be formed with `i` points.
   - Iterate through each possible point value from 1 to `K` and each digit from 0 to 9.
   - Update `max_digits` if a valid number can be formed using the current digit.
4. **Writing the output**: The results are written to the file `imprimanta.out`.

This solution should be efficient and correct given the constraints in the problem.

I see where the issue is: the algorithm for constructing the largest number using exactly `K` points doesn't consider the constraint of wanting the largest number possible. The current dynamic programming approach constructs numbers in an increasing manner, which results in numbers like `11111111`. Instead, we need to prioritize larger digits first to ensure the largest number is formed.

Let's rewrite the solution with a different algorithm that prioritizes forming the largest number possible.

### Plan:
1. Read input from the file.
2. Find the digit with the minimum points for the given number `N`.
3. Construct the largest number with exactly `K` points by prioritizing larger digits first.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// Array to store the number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9
const int points_per_digit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
string construct_largest_number(int K) {
    // Digits sorted by their points in descending order of digit value
    vector<pair<int, int>> digit_points;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 9; ++i) {
        digit_points.push_back({points_per_digit[i], i});
    }
    sort(digit_points.begin(), digit_points.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.second > b.second; // Sort by digit value in decreasing order
    });

    string result;
    while (K > 0) {
        for (const auto& dp : digit_points) {
            if (K >= dp.first) {
                result.push_back('0' + dp.second);
                K -= dp.first;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Open input file
    ifstream infile("imprimanta.in");
    long long N;
    int K;
    infile >> N >> K;
    infile.close();

    // Convert N to string to easily access each digit
    string num_str = to_string(N);
    int min_points = INT_MAX;
    int largest_digit_with_min_points = -1;

    // Find the digit with the minimum number of points and track the largest such digit
    for (char ch : num_str) {
        int digit = ch - '0';
        if (points_per_digit[digit] < min_points) {
            min_points = points_per_digit[digit];
            largest_digit_with_min_points = digit;
        } else if (points_per_digit[digit] == min_points) {
            largest_digit_with_min_points = max(largest_digit_with_min_points, digit);
        }
    }

    // Construct the largest number with exactly K points
    string largest_number = construct_largest_number(K);

    // Write output to file
    ofstream outfile("imprimanta.out");
    outfile << largest_digit_with_min_points << endl;
    outfile << largest_number << endl;
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `imprimanta.in`.
- **Finding the Digit with Minimum Points**: This part remains the same as the previous solution where we determine the largest digit among those which require the minimum number of points.
- **Constructing the Largest Number with Exactly `K` Points**:
  - The algorithm sorts the digits based on their point values but in descending order of digit value, so larger digits are considered first.
  - It iteratively picks the largest possible digit that can be formed with the remaining points `K` and appends it to the result, reducing `K` accordingly.
- **Output**: The results are written to the file `imprimanta.out`.

This approach ensures that we always form the largest possible number given the constraints. This should produce the correct and expected output.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated due to excessive memory usage or a segmentation fault. Given the problem context, it is more likely caused by the memory constraints. We need to handle the problem more efficiently without causing excessive memory usage.

The primary concern is the loop for constructing the largest number with exactly `K` points, which might be consuming a lot of memory if not managed properly.

Let's implement a more memory-efficient solution:

1. **Find the digit with the minimum points for `N`**.
2. **Construct the largest number with exactly `K` points**:
   - Use a greedy approach to construct the largest number by starting from the largest digit possible.

        digit_points.push_back({points_per_digit[i], i});

                result.push_back('0' + dp.second);
                K -= dp.first;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {

    infile.close();

    int largest_digit_with_min_points = -1;

    // Find the digit with the minimum number of points and track the largest such digit
    for (char ch : num_str) {
        int digit = ch - '0';
        if (points_per_digit[digit] < min_points) {
            min_points = points_per_digit[digit];
            largest_digit_with_min_points = digit;
        } else if (points_per_digit[digit] == min_points) {
            largest_digit_with_min_points = max(largest_digit_with_min_points, digit);
        }
    }

    // Construct the largest number with exactly K points
    string largest_number = construct_largest_number(K);

    // Write output to file
    ofstream outfile("imprimanta.out");
    outfile << largest_digit_with_min_points << endl;
    outfile << largest_number << endl;
    outfile.close();

The exit code 137 indicates that the program is being killed due to excessive memory usage. Given that `K` can be as large as 100,000, constructing a string directly in a loop might cause memory issues.

To address this, we need a more efficient approach to manage memory without constructing excessively large intermediate results. Here's a refined approach:

1. **Find the digit with the minimum points for `N`**.
2. **Construct the largest number with exactly `K` points** using a greedy algorithm but with careful memory management:
   - Track the remaining points and the current part of the result.
   - Append digits one at a time without constructing large intermediate results.

It appears the program is still being killed due to excessive memory usage or some other issue related to resource limits. Given the constraints, we need to handle the memory management more carefully and ensure that our solution is efficient.

Let's reassess the solution and ensure we are not causing any undue memory or computational overhead.

### Plan:
1. **Read the input values**.
2. **Find the digit with the minimum points for `N`**.
3. **Construct the largest number with exactly `K` points** efficiently:
   - Use a greedy approach to ensure we always use larger digits first to maximize the resulting number.
   - Manage memory usage carefully to avoid excessive allocations.

Here is the revised and optimized solution:

            largest_digit_with_min_points = digit;
        } else if (points_per_digit[digit] == min_points) {
            largest_digit_with_min_points = max(largest_digit_with_min_points, digit);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read from the file `imprimanta.in`.
2. **Finding the Digit with Minimum Points**: This part identifies the digit within `N` that requires the minimum number of points and ensures it tracks the largest such digit.
3. **Constructing the Largest Number**:
   - The digits along with their points are sorted in descending order of digit value.
   - The program constructs the largest number by using the largest possible digits first, while ensuring it stays within the point limit `K`.
   - This is done efficiently by iteratively selecting the largest digit that fits within the remaining points and appending it to the result.

This approach ensures minimal memory usage and efficient computation, thus avoiding any resource constraints.

The issue lies in the second part of the problem where we need to construct the largest number with exactly `K` points. The result should be `74` but the code generates `997`. This indicates the greedy approach is not correctly optimizing for the largest possible number considering all constraints.

### Evaluation:
### Problem:
The current greedy approach constructs the largest number by appending the largest possible digits within the remaining points. However, it doesn't account for the optimal combination of digits that would yield the largest number. 

### Solution:
To construct the largest possible number with exactly `K` points, we should use a different strategy:
1. **Find the digit with the minimum points for `N`**.
2. **Determine the number of digits we can print with `K` points**.
3. **Iteratively build the largest number by selecting appropriate digits**.

### Steps:
1. **Read the input values**.
2. **Compute the minimum points and the largest digit**.
3. **Determine the optimal number construction using a dynamic approach.**

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

// Array to store the number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9

### Explanation:
- **Reading Input**: The input values are read from the file `imprimanta.in`.
- **Finding the Digit with Minimum Points**: This part identifies the digit within `N` that requires the minimum number of points and ensures it tracks the largest such digit.
- **Determine the Number of Digits**:
  - Calculate the maximum length of the number that can be formed with `K` points by iteratively subtracting the smallest point value.
- **Construct the Largest Number**:
  - Sort the digits based on their point values.
  - Construct the result by choosing the largest possible digit that fits within the remaining points and ensures that the remaining points can still form a valid number.

This approach ensures that the largest possible number is constructed while correctly managing the point constraints.

The incorrect output indicates that the logic for constructing the largest number using exactly \( K \) points is still not correctly implemented. Specifically, the code is prioritizing digits incorrectly, leading to repeated digits like `11111111` instead of an optimal solution like `74`.

### Evaluation:
- The key issue is in the logic where we attempt to construct the largest number by iterating through digits in descending order of value. However, the constraints and the calculation result in non-optimal digit combinations.

### Solution:
We need a more robust strategy for constructing the largest number. Here's a revised approach:
1. **Find the digit with the minimum points for `N`**.
2. **Determine the maximum number of digits that can be printed with `K` points**.
3. **Iteratively construct the largest number digit by digit by ensuring the remaining points can still form the remaining digits optimally**.

### Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// Array to store the number of points needed to print each digit from 0 to 9
const int points_per_digit[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

int main() {
    // Open input file
    ifstream infile("imprimanta.in");
    long long N;
    int K;
    infile >> N >> K;
    infile.close();

    // Convert N to string to easily access each digit
    string num_str = to_string(N);
    int min_points = INT_MAX;
    int largest_digit_with_min_points = -1;

    // Find the digit with the minimum number of points and track the largest such digit
    for (char ch : num_str) {
        int digit = ch - '0';
        if (points_per_digit[digit] < min_points) {
            min_points = points_per_digit[digit];
            largest_digit_with_min_points = digit;
        } else if (points_per_digit[digit] == min_points) {
            largest_digit_with_min_points = max(largest_digit_with_min_points, digit);
        }
    }

    // Array to store the sorted digits by points and then by value
    vector<pair<int, int>> digit_points;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 9; ++i) {
        digit_points.push_back({points_per_digit[i], i});
    }
    sort(digit_points.begin(), digit_points.end());

    // Calculate the maximum length of the number we can form with K points
    int max_length = 0;
    int remaining_points = K;
    while (remaining_points >= digit_points[0].first) {
        remaining_points -= digit_points[0].first;
        max_length++;
    }

    // Construct the largest number with exactly K points
    string result;
    remaining_points = K;
    for (int i = 0; i < max_length; ++i) {
        for (auto it = digit_points.rbegin(); it != digit_points.rend(); ++it) {
            if (remaining_points >= it->first && (remaining_points - it->first) / digit_points[0].first >= max_length - i - 1) {
                result.push_back('0' + it->second);
                remaining_points -= it->first;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write output to file
    ofstream outfile("imprimanta.out");
    outfile << largest_digit_with_min_points << endl;
    outfile << result << endl;
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Reading Input**: The input values are read from the file `imprimanta.in`.
- **Finding the Digit with Minimum Points**: This part identifies the digit within `N` that requires the minimum number of points and ensures it tracks the largest such digit.
- **Determine the Number of Digits**:
  - Calculate the maximum length of the number that can be formed with `K` points by iteratively subtracting the smallest point value.
- **Construct the Largest Number**:
  - The digits along with their points are sorted in ascending order of points.
  - Construct the result by choosing the largest possible digit that fits within the remaining points and ensures that the remaining points can still form a valid number.

This approach ensures that the largest possible number is constructed while correctly managing the point constraints. The key difference here is the loop where we ensure the remaining points are sufficient to form the remaining digits, thus avoiding suboptimal results like `11111111`.
