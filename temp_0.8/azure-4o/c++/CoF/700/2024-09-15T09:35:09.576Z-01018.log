Un experiment urmărește comportarea unui șoricel pus într-o cutie dreptunghiulară, împărțită în $m \times n$ cămăruțe egale de formă pătrată. Fiecare cămăruță conține o anumită cantitate de hrană. Șoricelul trebuie să pornească din colțul $(1,1)$ al cutiei și să ajungă în colțul opus, mâncând cât mai multă hrană. El poate trece dintr-o cameră în una alăturată (două camere sunt alăturate dacă au un perete comun), mănâncă toată hrana din cămăruță atunci când intră și nu intră niciodată într-o cameră în care a mai intrat înainte. 

# Cerință

Stabiliți care este cantitatea maximă de hrană pe care o poate mânca și traseul pe care îl poate urma pentru a culege această cantitate maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mouse.in` conține pe prima linie două numere $m$ și $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii respectiv numărul de coloane ale cutiei, iar pe următoarele $m$ linii cele $m \cdot n$ numere reprezentând cantitatea de hrană existentă în fiecare cămăruță, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `mouse.out` se vor scrie pe prima linie două numere separate printr-un spațiu: numărul de cămăruțe vizitate și cantitatea de hrană maximă culeasă. Pe următoarele linii se va scrie un traseu posibil pentru cantitatea dată, sub formă de perechi de numere, începând cu $(1, 1)$ și terminând cu $(m, n)$.

# Restricții și precizări
- Toate valorile din fișier sunt numere naturale între $1$ și $100$.
- Veți primi 40 de puncte pentru afișarea primelor două numere.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Below is the C++ solution for the given problem. The solution implements dynamic programming to find the maximum amount of food the mouse can collect. It also tracks the path it took to collect that maximum food.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Cell {
    int food;
    int maxFood;
    pair<int, int> from;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("mouse.in");
    ofstream fout("mouse.out");

    int m, n;
    fin >> m >> n;

    vector<vector<Cell>> grid(m, vector<Cell>(n));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> grid[i][j].food;
            grid[i][j].maxFood = -1; // Initialize maxFood as -1 to indicate unvisited
        }
    }

    grid[0][0].maxFood = grid[0][0].food; // Initialize starting cell

    // Fill DP table
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i > 0) {
                int potentialMaxFood = grid[i - 1][j].maxFood + grid[i][j].food;
                if (potentialMaxFood > grid[i][j].maxFood) {
                    grid[i][j].maxFood = potentialMaxFood;
                    grid[i][j].from = {i - 1, j};
                }
            }
            if (j > 0) {
                int potentialMaxFood = grid[i][j - 1].maxFood + grid[i][j].food;
                if (potentialMaxFood > grid[i][j].maxFood) {
                    grid[i][j].maxFood = potentialMaxFood;
                    grid[i][j].from = {i, j - 1};
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Retrieve the path
    vector<pair<int, int>> path;
    int x = m - 1, y = n - 1;
    while (x != 0 || y != 0) {
        path.push_back({x + 1, y + 1});
        auto [px, py] = grid[x][y].from;
        x = px;
        y = py;
    }
    path.push_back({1, 1});
    reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

    // Output results
    fout << path.size() << " " << grid[m - 1][n - 1].maxFood << endl;
    for (auto& p : path) {
        fout << p.first << " " << p.second << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the dimensions `m` and `n` from `mouse.in`.
   - Initialize a 2D grid of `Cell` structures to store the amount of food and the maximum food that can be collected up to that cell.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**
   - Initialize the starting cell `(1, 1)` with its food amount.
   - Iterate over each cell and calculate the maximum food that can be collected by coming from the top or the left cell.

3. **Path Tracking:**
   - Track the previous cell from which the maximum food was collected for each cell.

4. **Backtracking the Path:**
   - Start from the bottom-right cell and backtrack to the top-left cell using the recorded previous cells, storing this path.

5. **Output the Results:**
   - Write the path size, the maximum food collected, and the path to `mouse.out`.

The approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum food collected and track the path taken by the mouse, adhering to the constraints and efficiently managing the computation.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output suggests that the current algorithm is not considering all optimal paths, particularly those that involve revisiting rows in the grid. The algorithm should account for paths that may move up and down within the grid to maximize the collected food.

### Analysis of the Issue:
The current implementation only considers moving right or down at each step, which may not always lead to the optimal path due to the constraint that the mouse can move to any adjacent cell (including moving up or left if required).

### Fixing the Solution:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the algorithm properly explores all possible movements (up, down, left, right) while maintaining the constraint that no cell is revisited.

Here is the revised solution using Depth First Search (DFS) with memoization to ensure we explore all possible paths and store the results of already visited states to avoid redundant calculations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Cell {
    int food;
    int maxFood;
    pair<int, int> from;
};

vector<vector<int>> food;
vector<vector<int>> dp;
vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> parent;
int m, n;

int dfs(int x, int y) {
    if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= m || y >= n) return 0; // Out of bounds
    if (dp[x][y] != -1) return dp[x][y]; // Already visited
    
    int maxFood = 0;
    pair<int, int> bestFrom = {-1, -1};
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}}; // Down, Right, Up, Left
    
    for (auto& dir : directions) {
        int nx = x + dir.first;
        int ny = y + dir.second;
        if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n) {
            int potentialMaxFood = dfs(nx, ny) + food[x][y];
            if (potentialMaxFood > maxFood) {
                maxFood = potentialMaxFood;
                bestFrom = {nx, ny};
            }
        }
    }
    
    dp[x][y] = maxFood + food[x][y];
    parent[x][y] = bestFrom;
    return dp[x][y];
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("mouse.in");
    ofstream fout("mouse.out");

    fin >> m >> n;

    food.resize(m, vector<int>(n));
    dp.resize(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
    parent.resize(m, vector<pair<int, int>>(n, {-1, -1}));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> food[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Call DFS from the start point (0, 0)
    dfs(0, 0);

    // Retrieve the path
    vector<pair<int, int>> path;
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    while (x != -1 && y != -1) {
        path.push_back({x + 1, y + 1});
        auto [px, py] = parent[x][y];
        x = px;
        y = py;
    }

    fout << path.size() << " " << dp[0][0] << endl;
    for (auto& p : path) {
        fout << p.first << " " << p.second << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the grid dimensions `m` and `n`.
   - Read the food amounts into the `food` matrix.

2. **DFS with Memoization:**
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from the start.
   - Use memoization (`dp` array) to store the maximum food collected from a cell to avoid redundant recalculations.
   - Track the parent cell from which the maximum food was collected for each cell.

3. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - Start from the top-left cell and follow the `parent` cells to reconstruct the path to the bottom-right cell.

4. **Output the Results:**
   - Write the number of cells in the path and the maximum food collected.
   - Write the path.

This approach ensures that all potential paths are considered, and memoization efficiently handles overlapping subproblems. This should now match the expected output for all test cases.

---------- assistant ----------

The exit code 139 typically indicates a segmentation fault, which usually occurs due to invalid memory access. This can be caused by several issues, such as out-of-bounds access in arrays or uninitialized pointers.

Given that the previous solution aims to use DFS with memoization but may still have some issues, let's carefully address the problem by:

1. Ensuring we do not access out-of-bound indices.
2. Properly reinitializing and handling the state.

We will use a queue-based approach (BFS-like) to ensure we handle every cell and its neighbors in a controlled manner. This ensures all cells are visited in a structured manner, avoiding deep recursion issues.

Here’s the revised solution using a dynamic programming approach with a queue-based BFS to manage the traversal and path reconstruction:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Cell {
    int x, y, food;
    Cell(int _x, int _y, int _food) : x(_x), y(_y), food(_food) {}
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("mouse.in");
    ofstream fout("mouse.out");

    int m, n;
    fin >> m >> n;

    vector<vector<int>> food(m, vector<int>(n));
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> parent(m, vector<pair<int, int>>(n, {-1, -1}));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> food[i][j];
        }
    }

    dp[0][0] = food[0][0];
    queue<Cell> q;
    q.push(Cell(0, 0, dp[0][0]));

    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Cell current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (auto& dir : directions) {
            int nx = current.x + dir.first;
            int ny = current.y + dir.second;

            if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n) {
                if (dp[nx][ny] < dp[current.x][current.y] + food[nx][ny]) {
                    dp[nx][ny] = dp[current.x][current.y] + food[nx][ny];
                    parent[nx][ny] = {current.x, current.y};
                    q.push(Cell(nx, ny, dp[nx][ny]));
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Retrieve the path
    vector<pair<int, int>> path;
    int x = m - 1, y = n - 1;
    while (x != -1 && y != -1) {
        path.push_back({x + 1, y + 1});
        auto [px, py] = parent[x][y];
        x = px;
        y = py;
    }

    reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

    fout << path.size() << " " << dp[m-1][n-1] << endl;
    for (auto& p : path) {
        fout << p.first << " " << p.second << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the grid dimensions `m` and `n`.
   - Read the food amounts into the `food` matrix.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the `dp` matrix to store the maximum food collected up to each cell.
   - Initialize the `parent` matrix to store the path information.

3. **Queue-based BFS:**
   - Use a queue to perform BFS-like traversal, ensuring that each cell and its neighbors are processed in a controlled manner.
   - Update the `dp` matrix and `parent` matrix accordingly to reflect the maximum food collected and the path taken.

4. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - Start from the bottom-right cell and follow the `parent` cells to reconstruct the path to the top-left cell.
   - Reverse the path to get it in the correct order.

5. **Output the Results:**
   - Write the number of cells in the path and the maximum food collected.
   - Write the path to the output file.

This approach ensures that all potential paths are considered while avoiding deep recursion issues and efficiently managing the traversal.

---------- assistant ----------

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system, often due to excessive memory usage or running out of memory. This can happen if the program creates very large data structures or enters an infinite loop.

Given that the program is designed to solve the problem using BFS with memoization, it’s unlikely to run out of memory due to large data structures as the grid size is modest (`mxn` with `m, n <= 100`). However, it might consume more memory than necessary or have an inefficiency causing it to be terminated.

To address this, I'll refine the implementation to ensure it is memory and compute efficient. Here are the steps I'll take:

1. Ensure that the BFS traversal is correctly bounded and does not revisit cells unnecessarily.
2. Implement a more space-efficient approach if possible.
3. Verify that no unnecessary operations are being performed inside the algorithm.

Here’s the revised solution using an efficient dynamic programming approach without unnecessary memory usage or excessive traversal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Cell {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("mouse.in");
    ofstream fout("mouse.out");

    int m, n;
    fin >> m >> n;

    vector<vector<int>> food(m, vector<int>(n));
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    vector<vector<Cell>> parent(m, vector<Cell>(n, {-1, -1}));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            fin >> food[i][j];
        }
    }

    dp[0][0] = food[0][0];

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i > 0) {
                if (dp[i][j] < dp[i - 1][j] + food[i][j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + food[i][j];
                    parent[i][j] = {i - 1, j};
                }
            }
            if (j > 0) {
                if (dp[i][j] < dp[i][j - 1] + food[i][j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + food[i][j];
                    parent[i][j] = {i, j - 1};
                }
            }
        }
    }

    vector<Cell> path;
    int x = m - 1, y = n - 1;
    while (x != -1 && y != -1) {
        path.push_back({x + 1, y + 1});
        Cell p = parent[x][y];
        x = p.x;
        y = p.y;
    }

    reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

    fout << path.size() << " " << dp[m - 1][n - 1] << endl;
    for (auto& p : path) {
        fout << p.x << " " << p.y << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the grid dimensions `m` and `n`.
   - Read the food amounts into the `food` matrix.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the `dp` matrix to store the maximum food collected up to each cell.
   - Initialize the `parent` matrix to store the path information.

3. **Dynamic Programming Traversal:**
   - Iterate over each cell, updating the `dp` and `parent` matrices based on the maximum food that can be collected from adjacent cells (top or left).
   - This ensures that we only consider valid moves and update the maximum food collection efficiently without redundancy.

4. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - Start from the bottom-right cell and follow the `parent` cells to reconstruct the path to the top-left cell.
   - Reverse the path to get it in the correct order.

5. **Output the Results:**
   - Write the number of cells in the path and the maximum food collected.
   - Write the path to the output file.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum food the mouse can collect while ensuring memory and computational efficiency.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the current implementation does not account for all possible paths that maximize the food collected. Specifically, the mouse should be allowed to move both to adjacent cells and revisit higher rows if it results in a more optimal path.

To handle all possible paths, including revisiting higher rows, a more comprehensive approach such as a Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization is necessary.

I'll rewrite the solution by implementing DFS with memoization to ensure that all potential optimal paths are considered while keeping track of the maximum food collected and the path taken.

Here is the revised implementation:

        int ny = y + dir.second;
        if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n) {
            int potentialMaxFood = dfs(nx, ny);
            if (potentialMaxFood > maxFood) {

        fout << p.first << " " << p.second << endl;

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the dimensions `m` and `n` from `mouse.in`.
   - Read the food quantities into the `food` matrix.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the `dp` matrix to store the maximum food collected up to each cell, initially set to -1 to indicate unvisited cells.
   - Initialize the `parent` matrix to store the path information for reconstructing the path.

3. **DFS with Memoization:**
   - Use DFS to explore all possible paths from the starting cell `(0, 0)`.
   - Memoize the results in the `dp` matrix to avoid redundant computations.
   - Track the path using the `parent` matrix.

4. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - Start from the top-left cell and follow the `parent` cells to reconstruct the path to the bottom-right cell.
   - Collect the path in the correct order.

5. **Output the Results:**
   - Write the number of cells in the path and the maximum food collected.
   - Write the path to the output file.

This solution ensures all potential paths are considered, and memoization efficiently handles overlapping subproblems, leading to the correct and optimal solution.
