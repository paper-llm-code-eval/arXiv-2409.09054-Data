Un elev în clasa a V-a, Rareş, s-a gândit să studieze mersul trenurilor ce trec prin gara din oraşul său, într-o zi. Gara are $2$ linii, numerotate cu $1$ şi $2$, pe care sosesc şi pleacă trenurile. În acea zi, în gară sosesc $T$ trenuri. Pentru fiecare tren din cele $T$, Rareş cunoaşte linia $L$ pe care va sosi, momentul sosirii, adică ora $H$ şi minutul $M$, precum şi durata de timp $S$ de staţionare (exprimată în minute). El a decis ca perioada de studiu a celor $T$ trenuri să înceapă cu momentul sosirii primului tren în gară din cele $T$ şi să se încheie odată cu momentul plecării ultimului tren din cele $T$.

Din sala de aşteptare Rareş poate vedea cele $2$ linii. Rareş are însă o problemă: atunci când un tren se află în gară pe linia $1$, el nu poate vedea trenul staţionat în acelaşi timp pe linia $2$. De exemplu, dacă un tren ajunge în gară pe linia $1$ la ora $14:21$ şi staţionează $5$ minute atunci trenul va pleca din gară la ora $14:26$. Astfel, în intervalul de timp [$14:21-14:26$], Rareş nu poate vedea ce se întâmplă pe linia $2$. Trenul de pe linia $2$ va putea fi vizibil începând cu minutul următor, adică de la $14:27$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine pentru un număr $T$ de trenuri care trec prin gară în perioada de studiu din acea zi:

* numărul maxim de trenuri $Z$ care au staţionat pe aceeaşi linie;
* numărul $X$ de trenuri pe care Rareş le vede;
* durata de timp maximă $Y$ (exprimată în număr de minute consecutive), din perioada de studiu, în care Rareş nu a văzut niciun tren.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `tren.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $T$ de trenuri şi pe fiecare din următoarele $T$ linii, în ordinea sosirii trenurilor în gară, câte patru numere naturale $L$, $H$, $M$ şi $S$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, ce reprezintă linia $L$ pe care soseşte trenul, momentul sosirii trenului (ora $H$ şi minutul $M$) şi durata de timp $S$ de staţionare.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `tren.out` conţine pe prima linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu, valorile cerute $Z$, $X$ și $Y$ (în această ordine).

# Restricții și precizări


* $2 \leq T \leq 100$; $0 \leq H \leq 23$; $0 \leq M \leq 59$; $1 \leq S \leq 9$;
* în acelaşi moment de timp nu pot pleca/sosi mai multe trenuri;
* în acelaşi moment de timp nu poate pleca un tren şi altul să sosească;
* pe aceeaşi linie nu pot staţiona mai multe trenuri în acelaşi moment de timp;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $Z$ se acordă 20% din punctajul pe test;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $X$ se acordă 40% din punctajul pe test;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $Y$ se acordă 40% din punctajul pe test.

## Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read from the file `tren.in`.
   - The number of trains `T` is read, and then for each train, its line (`L`), arrival time (`H` and `M`), and duration (`S`) are read.
   - The arrival time is converted into the number of minutes from the start of the day using the `timeToMinutes` function.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - The details of each train are stored in a `struct Train`.
   - The arrival and departure times for each train are calculated and stored.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The trains are sorted by their arrival times to process them in chronological order.

4. **Processing Trains:**
   - Various counters track the number of trains on each line, the number of visible trains, and the maximum number of trains on the same line.
   - The overlapping periods between the two lines are checked to count the number of visible trains.
   - The longest period during which no trains are visible to Rareș is calculated.

5. **Output:**
   - The results are written to the file `tren.out`.

This solution ensures that the trains are processed efficiently and the required values (Z, X, Y) are computed correctly in accordance with the given constraints.

Let's break down the discrepancies between the expected and found results, understand the issues, and propose a solution.

### Evaluation of Differences

1. **Visible Trains (X) Count Mismatch**:
   - Expected: 5
   - Found: 4

2. **Longest No-See Period (Y) Mismatch**:
   - Expected: 11
   - Found: 860

### Issues Identified

1. **Visible Trains Calculation**:
   - The code does not correctly account for overlapping visibility between lines.
   - It only checks if the last departure time of one line is before the arrival time of the other line, which is insufficient.

2. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - The large value of 860 suggests there is a logic error in calculating the no-see period.
   - The calculation of the no-see period needs to be adjusted to correctly reflect periods where no trains are visible on either line.

### Plan to Fix the Solution

1. **Visible Trains Calculation**:
   - Use two separate lists to track occupied periods for both lines and ensure correct overlap detection.
   - Use a timeline approach to mark visibility periods.

2. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - Track periods when no trains are present on either line properly.
   - Use sorting and interval merging techniques to determine periods of no visibility accurately.

### Rewritten Solution

Let's implement the solution with these improvements:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

    for (const auto &train : trains) {
        if (train.line == 1) {
            periodsLine1.push_back({train.arrival, train.departure});
            countLine1++;
            maxTrainsOnSameLine = std::max(maxTrainsOnSameLine, countLine1);

    int lastEnd = allPeriods[0].second;

    for (const auto &period : allPeriods) {
        if (period.first > lastEnd) {

    fout << maxTrainsOnSameLine << " " << visibleTrains << " " << maxNoSeeTime << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Rewritten Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Same as before: read the number of trains and store each train's details after converting the arrival time to minutes from the start of the day.

2. **Sorting and Counting**:
   - Trains are sorted by arrival time.
   - Counters for trains on each line are maintained separately.
   - Two separate vectors store periods of visibility for each line.

3. **Visibility Calculation**:
   - For each train, check against periods of the other line to determine visibility.
   - Increase the visible trains count if no overlap is found.

4. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - Combine periods of visibility from both lines.
   - Sort and merge these periods, tracking gaps to determine the longest no-see period accurately.

This solution should now correctly calculate the required values Z, X, and Y.

Upon further analysis, the previous solution has issues in the visibility calculation and the merging of periods to find the longest no-see period. Let's identify where the errors might be and propose a new implementation that correctly handles the requirements.

### Issues Identified

1. **Visible Trains Calculation**:
   - The logic for determining if a train is visible is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle situations where partial overlaps occur.
   
2. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - The merging of periods and calculating the no-see period isn't robust enough.

### New Approach

1. **Visible Trains Calculation**:
   - Use a more robust method to determine if a train on one line blocks the view of trains on the other line.

2. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - Use event-based simulation to track when trains are visible and determine the longest period without visibility.

### Rewritten Solution

Let's implement the new solution with these corrections:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Train {
    int line;
    int arrival;
    int departure;
};

struct Event {
    int time;
    int type; // 1 for arrival, -1 for departure
    int line;
};

// Convert time (H, M) to minutes from the start of the day
int timeToMinutes(int H, int M) {
    return H * 60 + M;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("tren.in");
    std::ofstream fout("tren.out");

    int T;
    fin >> T;

    std::vector<Train> trains(T);
    std::vector<Event> events;

    for (int i = 0; i < T; ++i) {
        int L, H, M, S;
        fin >> L >> H >> M >> S;
        int arrival = timeToMinutes(H, M);
        int departure = arrival + S;
        trains[i] = {L, arrival, departure};
        events.push_back({arrival, 1, L});
        events.push_back({departure, -1, L});
    }

    // Process for max trains on the same line
    int maxTrainsOnSameLine = 0, countLine1 = 0, countLine2 = 0;
    for (const auto &train : trains) {
        if (train.line == 1) {
            countLine1++;
            maxTrainsOnSameLine = std::max(maxTrainsOnSameLine, countLine1);
        } else {
            countLine2++;
            maxTrainsOnSameLine = std::max(maxTrainsOnSameLine, countLine2);
        }
    }

    // Process for visible trains and no-see periods
    std::sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const Event &a, const Event &b) {
        return a.time < b.time || (a.time == b.time && a.type < b.type);
    });

    int visibleTrains = 0;
    int lastTime = events[0].time;
    int maxNoSeeTime = 0;
    bool line1Occupied = false, line2Occupied = false;

    for (const auto &event : events) {
        // Check if there was a no-see period
        if (!line1Occupied && !line2Occupied) {
            maxNoSeeTime = std::max(maxNoSeeTime, event.time - lastTime);
        }

        // Update the occupancy status
        if (event.line == 1) {
            line1Occupied = (event.type == 1);
        } else {
            line2Occupied = (event.type == 1);
        }

        // Check if the train is visible
        if (event.type == 1) {
            if ((event.line == 1 && !line2Occupied) || (event.line == 2 && !line1Occupied)) {
                visibleTrains++;
            }
        }

        lastTime = event.time;
    }

    fout << maxTrainsOnSameLine << " " << visibleTrains << " " << maxNoSeeTime << "\n";

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the New Implementation

1. **Input Reading**:
   - As before, read the number of trains and store each train's details.

2. **Events Creation**:
   - Create events for arrivals and departures of all trains. Each event contains the time, type (arrival or departure), and the line number.

3. **Sorting Events**:
   - Sort the events in chronological order. If two events occur at the same time, departure events are processed before arrival events to handle transitions correctly.

4. **Calculating Maximum Trains on Same Line**:
   - Count the total trains on each line and keep track of the maximum number encountered.

5. **Simulating Events**:
   - Traverse the sorted events to manage the occupancy status of both lines.
   - Track the periods when both lines are unoccupied to calculate the longest no-see period.
   - Check visibility conditions to count the number of visible trains.

This approach ensures accurate calculation of the maximum number of trains on the same line, the number of visible trains, and the longest period without visibility.

Given that the previous solution still has discrepancies with the expected output, let's reassess the approach and identify potential issues in the logic:

### Issues Identified

1. **Visible Trains Calculation**:
   - The code incorrectly determines the visibility of trains. It should check continuous periods of visibility rather than individual events.

2. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the longest no-see period might not be capturing all edge cases correctly.

### Revised Plan

1. **Visible Trains Calculation**:
   - Use a timeline and maintain a status to more accurately check if a train is visible when it arrives, considering the occupancy of the other line.

2. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - Use a more precise timeline-based simulation to accurately determine gaps in visibility.

### Rewritten Solution

```

### Explanation of the Revised Implementation

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Read the number of trains and store each train's details.
   - Create events for arrivals and departures with their respective times.

2. **Event Sorting**:
   - Sort events in chronological order. Arrivals are processed before departures if they occur at the same time.

3. **Max Trains on Same Line Calculation**:
   - Count the number of trains on each line and keep track of the maximum number encountered.

4. **Simulating Events**:
   - Traverse the sorted events to manage the occupancy status of both lines.
   - Track the periods when both lines are unoccupied to calculate the longest no-see period.
   - Check visibility conditions using flags to count the number of visible trains accurately.

This approach ensures accurate calculation of the maximum number of trains on the same line (Z), the number of visible trains (X), and the longest period without visibility (Y), addressing the issues found in the previous solutions.

Let's analyze the results and figure out why they are not matching the expected output. 

### Issues Identified

1. **Max Trains on Same Line Calculation (Z)**:
   - The result indicates `1`, which is incorrect.
   - The logic to update the maximum number of trains on the same line is flawed.

2. **Visible Trains Calculation (X)**:
   - The result indicates `4`, which is incorrect.
   - The logic to determine visibility doesn't account for edge cases properly.

3. **Longest No-See Time Calculation (Y)**:
   - The result indicates `12`, which is incorrect.
   - The logic to determine the no-see period might be capturing incorrect intervals.

### Revised Plan

1. **Max Trains on Same Line Calculation (Z)**:
   - Use proper counters for each line and update the maximum count as we iterate through the events.

2. **Visible Trains Calculation (X)**:
   - Maintain flags for both lines to check if a train is visible when it arrives.

3. **Longest No-See Time Calculation (Y)**:
   - Track visibility intervals more accurately using a timeline-based approach.

### Rewritten Solution

Here is the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Train {
    int line;
    int arrival;
    int departure;

        if (a.first == b.first)

        // Update the max no-see time if both lines are not occupied

                line2Occupied = (countLine2 > 0);
            }
        }

        lastTime = currentTime;
    }

    fout << maxTrainsOnSameLine << " " << visibleTrains << " " << maxNoSeeTime << "\n";

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Implementation

1. **Input Reading**:
   - We read the number of trains and their details as before.
   - We also create events for the arrival and departure of each train.

2. **Event Sorting**:
   - Events are sorted in chronological order. Arrivals are processed before departures if they occur at the same time.

3. **Max Trains on Same Line Calculation (Z)**:
   - We maintain counters `countLine1` and `countLine2` to track the number of trains on each line.
   - The maximum number of trains on the same line is updated during each arrival event.

4. **Visible Trains Calculation (X)**:
   - We use flags `line1Occupied` and `line2Occupied` to track the occupancy of each line.
   - Visibility is determined based on the occupancy status of the other line during each arrival event.

5. **Longest No-See Time Calculation (Y)**:
   - We track periods when neither line is occupied and calculate the longest such period.

This revised code should correctly calculate the maximum number of trains on the same line (Z), the number of visible trains (X), and the longest period without visibility (Y).

Thank you for your patience. Let's reevaluate the solution step by step to address any discrepancies and ensure correctness.

### Evaluation and Analysis of Differences

1. **Max Trains on Same Line (Z)**:
   - The value `1` indicates that the code does not correctly count the maximum number of trains present simultaneously on the same line.

2. **Visible Trains (X)**:
   - The value `4` suggests that the visibility logic is flawed.

3. **Longest No-See Time (Y)**:
   - The value `12` is incorrect, indicating that the calculation of periods where no trains are visible is not accurate.

### Corrective Measures

1. **Max Trains on Same Line (Z)**:
   - We need to correctly track the maximum number of trains on each line over time, ensuring that we count overlapping intervals accurately.

2. **Visible Trains (X)**:
   - Implement a more precise logic that properly handles train visibility based on the occupancy of the other line.

3. **Longest No-See Time (Y)**:
   - Use a simulation approach to accurately measure the periods when no trains are visible on either line.

### Rewritten Solution

Here is the corrected implementation, ensuring we address the issues identified:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

        if (a.first == b.first)
            return a.second > b.second;
        return a.first < b.first;
    });

    int maxTrainsOnSameLine = 0;

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Comprehensive Explanation

1. **Input Reading**:
   - We read the number of trains and their details as before.
   - We also create events for the arrival and departure of each train. Each event is represented by a pair where the first element is the time in minutes and the second element is the line number (positive for arrival, negative for departure).

2. **Event Sorting**:
   - Events are sorted in chronological order. Arrivals are processed before departures if they occur at the same time, achieved by sorting based on the second element in descending order.

3. **Max Trains on Same Line Calculation (Z)**:
   - We maintain counters `countLine1` and `countLine2` to track the number of trains on each line.
   - The maximum number of trains on the same line is updated during each arrival event.

4. **Visible Trains Calculation (X)**:
   - We use flags `line1Occupied` and `line2Occupied` to track the occupancy of each line.
   - Visibility is determined based on the occupancy status of the other line during each arrival event.

5. **Longest No-See Time Calculation (Y)**:
   - We track periods when neither line is occupied and calculate the longest such period, updating the maximum no-see time if both lines are not occupied.

This revised implementation should now correctly calculate the maximum number of trains on the same line (Z), the number of visible trains (X), and the longest period without visibility (Y).

Given the consistent discrepancies in the output despite several attempts to fix the code, we need to re-evaluate the entire approach. The core issues appear to be in the way visibility and maximum no-see periods are calculated. Let's start fresh and use event-based simulation more effectively.

### Plan

1. **Event Handling**:
   - Use events for train arrivals and departures.
   - Maintain counters for trains on each line and track the maximum count.
   - Use a timeline to track visibility and no-see periods accurately.

2. **Visibility Calculation**:
   - Check visibility based on the occupancy status of the other line at each event.

3. **Longest No-See Period Calculation**:
   - Track periods when neither line is occupied and determine the longest such period.

### Fresh Implementation

Here's the revised solution with a detailed approach to fixing the visibility and no-see period calculations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Train {
    int line;
    int arrival;
    int departure;
};

// Convert time (H, M) to minutes from the start of the day
int timeToMinutes(int H, int M) {
    return H * 60 + M;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("tren.in");
    std::ofstream fout("tren.out");

    int T;
    fin >> T;

    std::vector<Train> trains(T);
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> events;

    for (int i = 0; i < T; ++i) {
        int L, H, M, S;
        fin >> L >> H >> M >> S;
        int arrival = timeToMinutes(H, M);
        int departure = arrival + S;
        trains[i] = {L, arrival, departure};
        events.push_back({arrival, L});
        events.push_back({departure, -L});
    }

    // Sort events by time, then by type (arrivals before departures if the times are the same)
    std::sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const std::pair<int, int> &a, const std::pair<int, int> &b) {
        if (a.first == b.first)
            return a.second > b.second;
        return a.first < b.first;
    });

    int maxTrainsOnSameLine = 0;
    int visibleTrains = 0;
    int maxNoSeeTime = 0;

    int countLine1 = 0, countLine2 = 0;
    int lastTime = events[0].first;
    bool line1Occupied = false, line2Occupied = false;

    for (const auto &event : events) {
        int currentTime = event.first;
        int line = std::abs(event.second);
        int type = event.second > 0 ? 1 : -1;

        // Update the max no-see time if both lines are not occupied
        if (!line1Occupied && !line2Occupied) {
            maxNoSeeTime = std::max(maxNoSeeTime, currentTime - lastTime);
        }

        // Update the occupancy status
        if (line == 1) {
            if (type == 1) {
                countLine1++;
                line1Occupied = true;
                if (!line2Occupied) {
                    visibleTrains++;
                }
                maxTrainsOnSameLine = std::max(maxTrainsOnSameLine, countLine1);
            } else {
                countLine1--;
                line1Occupied = (countLine1 > 0);
            }
        } else {
            if (type == 1) {
                countLine2++;
                line2Occupied = true;
                if (!line1Occupied) {
                    visibleTrains++;
                }
                maxTrainsOnSameLine = std::max(maxTrainsOnSameLine, countLine2);
            } else {
                countLine2--;
                line2Occupied = (countLine2 > 0);
            }
        }

        lastTime = currentTime;
    }

    fout << maxTrainsOnSameLine << " " << visibleTrains << " " << maxNoSeeTime << "\n";

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Reading**:
   - We read the number of trains and their details.
   - We create events for the arrival and departure of each train.

2. **Event Sorting**:
   - Events are sorted chronologically. Arrivals are processed before departures if they occur at the same time.

3. **Max Trains on Same Line Calculation (Z)**:
   - We maintain counters (`countLine1`, `countLine2`) to track the number of trains on each line.
   - The maximum number of trains on the same line is updated during each arrival event.

4. **Visible Trains Calculation (X)**:
   - We use flags (`line1Occupied`, `line2Occupied`) to track the occupancy of each line.
   - Visibility is determined based on the occupancy status of the other line during each arrival event.

5. **Longest No-See Time Calculation (Y)**:
   - We track periods when neither line is occupied and calculate the longest such period.

### Detailed Corrections

- The previous solution might not correctly handle visibility at the exact moment of train departure due to the order of events.
- We ensure that events are sorted such that arrivals are processed before departures when they occur at the same time.
- We properly maintain flags to track the occupancy status of each line and ensure correct visibility checks.

This comprehensive approach should now produce the correct results for the given problem.
