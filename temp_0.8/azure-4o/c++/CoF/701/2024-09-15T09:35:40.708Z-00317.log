A fost o dată un balaur cu $6$ capete. Într-o zi, Făt-Frumos s-a supărat și i-a tăiat un cap. Peste noapte i-au crescut alte $6$ capete în loc. Pe același gât! A doua zi, Făt-Frumos iar i-a tăiat un cap, dar peste noapte balaurului i-au crescut în loc alte $6$ capete... și tot așa timp de $n$ zile. În cea de a ($n+1$)-a zi, Făt-Frumos s-a plictisit și a plecat acasă!

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de zile, și calculează câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `balaur.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `balaur.out` va conține un singur număr reprezentînd câte capete avea balaurul după $n$ zile.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 400 \ 000 \ 000$

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage the fact that each day, the dragon loses 1 head and gains 6 heads. This results in a net gain of 5 heads per day. Given that initially, the dragon has 6 heads, we can compute the number of heads after \( n \) days using a simple formula:

\[ \text{heads} = 6 + 5 \times n \]

Here is the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("balaur.in");
    std::ofstream fout("balaur.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    // Initial heads + (net gain per day * number of days)
    long long heads = 6 + 5LL * n;
    
    fout << heads << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. We use `ifstream` to read from the input file `balaur.in`.
2. We use `ofstream` to write to the output file `balaur.out`.
3. We read the value of `n` from the input file.
4. We calculate the number of heads after \( n \) days using the formula:
   \[ \text{heads} = 6 + 5 \times n \]
   - `5LL` ensures that the multiplication is done in `long long` to avoid overflow for large values of `n`.
5. We write the computed number of heads to the output file.
6. We close the input and output file streams.

This approach is optimal with a time complexity of \( O(1) \), ensuring it runs efficiently even for the upper limit of \( n = 400,000,000 \).

I apologize for the mistake in the initial analysis. The miscalculation comes from misunderstanding the problem's setup. Let's reevaluate the problem carefully:

- Initially, the dragon has 6 heads.
- Each day:
  - Făt-Frumos cuts off 1 head.
  - 6 new heads grow back.
- This results in a net increase of 5 heads per day.

So, if we start with 6 heads, here’s the step-by-step transformation:
- Day 0: 6 heads (initial)
- Day 1: 6 - 1 + 6 = 11 heads
- Day 2: 11 - 1 + 6 = 16 heads
- Day 3: 16 - 1 + 6 = 21 heads

Thus, the pattern is actually:
\[ \text{initial heads} + 5 \times n \]

Let's rewrite the solution considering this logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("balaur.in");
    std::ofstream fout("balaur.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    // Initial heads + (net gain per day * number of days)
    long long heads = 6 + 5LL * n;

    fout << heads << std::endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Read the value of \( n \) from the input file.
2. Calculate the number of heads after \( n \) days using the formula:
   \[ \text{heads} = \text{initial heads} + (\text{net gain per day} \times \text{number of days}) \]
   Here, initial heads = 6 and net gain per day = 5.
3. Write the result to the output file.

By applying this correct formula, the output for the input `3` will be:
\[ 6 + 5 \times 3 = 21 \]

This revised approach ensures the correct handling and efficient computation of the needed result.
