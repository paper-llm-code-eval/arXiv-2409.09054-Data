# Cerință

Fratele cel mic al lui Gigel primise de la Moş Crăciun un joc de cuburi colorate. Gigel tocmai terminase clasa a V-a şi nu se mai juca cu aşa ceva, dar când nu se uitau ceilalţi parcă l-ar fi însoţit pe cel mic la joc, mai ales când acesta înşira cele $n$ cuburi unul după altul, iar lui îi treceau prin cap tot felul de cerinţe pe care proful său de info le-ar fi putut scorni:

1. să vedem câte culori sunt în total;
2. care culoare este folosită pentru cele mai multe cuburi;
3. pozitiile de unde ar trebui scos un cub din şir astfel încât să se formeze din cuburile rămase un şir cât mai lung de cuburi alăturate de aceeaşi culoare.

# Date de intrare

Se citesc din fisierul `cuburi.in` $n$, numărul de cuburi, şi apoi, pe urmatoarea linie, o succesiune de $n$ numere de culori, separate prin spaţii. Culorile sunt numerotate începând cu $1$. Se cere să se afişeze pe ecran câte un răspuns pe o câte o linie nouă pentru fiecare cerinţă.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `cuburi.out` va conține câte o linie pentru răspunsul/răspunsurile fiecărei cerințe.

# Restricții și precizări

* $N$ este numar natural mai mic decât $200 \ 000$, iar culorile sunt în număr de maximum $10$, numerotate de la $1$ la $10$.
* Pentru teste in valoare de $40$ de puncte, $N \leq 100$;
* Pentru teste in valoare de alte $40$ de puncte, $N \leq 2\ 000$;
* Dacă la cerinţele $2$, $3$ sunt mai multe soluţii se vor preciza toate, in ordine crescatoare.
* Testele si restricțiile au fost modificate.

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of cubes `n`.
   - We read the colors of the cubes into the vector `colors`.
   - We maintain a count of each color using an `unordered_map` called `color_count`.

2. **Requirement 1:**
   - The number of unique colors is given by the size of `color_count`.

3. **Requirement 2:**
   - We find the maximum count of any color.
   - We gather all colors that have this maximum count and sort them.
   - We then output these colors.

4. **Requirement 3:**
   - We aim to find the longest sequence of cubes of the same color that can be formed by removing at most one cube.
   - For each color, we iterate through the sequence and count the length of the sequence of that color, while accounting for the possibility of removing one cube to maximize the sequence length.
   - We keep track of the maximum sequence length encountered.

### Notes:
- The solution avoids using `cin >>`, `cout <<`, `printf()`, or `scanf()` for reading and writing data, adhering to the problem constraints.
- The algorithm is designed to be efficient, with time complexity approximately `O(n)`, which is suitable given the constraints (`n` up to 200,000).

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy in the output. I have carefully evaluated the differences between the expected and found results.

The primary issue lies in the logic to determine the longest sequence of contiguous cubes of the same color after removing at most one cube. The initial approach didn't correctly handle the removal of one cube to maximize the sequence length.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct logic for this step.

Here is the updated code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cuburi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cuburi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> colors(n);
    std::unordered_map<int, int> color_count;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> colors[i];
        ++color_count[colors[i]];
    }

    // Requirement 1: Number of unique colors
    fout << color_count.size() << '\n';

    // Requirement 2: Color with the most cubes
    int max_count = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second > max_count) {
            max_count = entry.second;
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> most_frequent_colors;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second == max_count) {
            most_frequent_colors.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }
    std::sort(most_frequent_colors.begin(), most_frequent_colors.end());

    for (int color : most_frequent_colors) {
        fout << color << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    // Requirement 3: Longest sequence of cubes of the same color
    int max_sequence = 0;
    for (int color = 1; color <= 10; ++color) {
        int current_length = 0;
        int max_length = 0;
        int previous_length = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (colors[i] == color) {
                current_length++;
            } else {
                if (previous_length + current_length > max_length) {
                    max_length = previous_length + current_length;
                }
                previous_length = current_length;
                current_length = 0;
            }
        }

        if (previous_length + current_length > max_length) {
            max_length = previous_length + current_length;
        }

        max_sequence = std::max(max_sequence, max_length);
    }

    fout << max_sequence << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the New Logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of cubes `n`.
   - We read the colors of the cubes into the vector `colors`.
   - We maintain a count of each color using an `unordered_map` called `color_count`.

2. **Requirement 1:**
   - The number of unique colors is given by the size of `color_count`.

3. **Requirement 2:**
   - We find the maximum count of any color.
   - We gather all colors that have this maximum count and sort them.
   - We then output these colors.

4. **Requirement 3:**
   - For each color from 1 to 10 (as colors are numbered from 1 to 10), we traverse the sequence of cubes.
   - We keep track of the longest sequence of contiguous cubes of the current color, allowing for the removal of at most one cube.
   - We use `current_length` to track the current segment length and `previous_length` to track the previous segment length.
   - We update the `max_length` whenever the sequence is broken by a different color, considering the removal of one cube.
   - Finally, we update `max_sequence` with the longest sequence found for any color.

This updated approach ensures the correct calculation of the longest sequence of contiguous cubes of the same color after possibly removing one cube.

Thank you for your patience. Upon further evaluation, I realize that the logic for determining the longest sequence of contiguous cubes of the same color after removing at most one cube is incorrect. The solution needs to be rethought to correctly handle this problem.

We need to consider the longest sequence of the same colored cubes after removing one cube. To achieve this, we can use a sliding window approach to count and determine the maximum length.

Let's rewrite the solution from scratch.

Here is the corrected approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cuburi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cuburi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> colors(n);
    std::unordered_map<int, int> color_count;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> colors[i];
        ++color_count[colors[i]];
    }

    // Requirement 1: Number of unique colors
    fout << color_count.size() << '\n';

    // Requirement 2: Color with the most cubes
    int max_count = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second > max_count) {
            max_count = entry.second;
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> most_frequent_colors;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second == max_count) {
            most_frequent_colors.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }
    std::sort(most_frequent_colors.begin(), most_frequent_colors.end());

    for (int color : most_frequent_colors) {
        fout << color << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    // Requirement 3: Longest sequence of cubes of the same color
    int max_sequence = 0;
    for (int color = 1; color <= 10; ++color) {
        int current_length = 0;
        int max_length = 0;
        int prev_length = 0;
        int max_with_removal = 0;
        bool used_removal = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (colors[i] == color) {
                current_length++;
                if (used_removal) {
                    max_with_removal++;
                } else {
                    prev_length++;
                }
            } else {
                if (used_removal) {
                    max_length = std::max(max_length, max_with_removal);
                    max_with_removal = prev_length + 1;
                    prev_length = 0;
                    used_removal = false;
                } else {
                    used_removal = true;
                    max_with_removal = prev_length + 1;
                    prev_length = current_length;
                }
                current_length = 0;
            }
        }

        if (used_removal) {
            max_length = std::max(max_length, max_with_removal);
        }
        max_length = std::max(max_length, prev_length + current_length);

        max_sequence = std::max(max_sequence, max_length);
    }

    fout << max_sequence << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

Thank you for your patience. Based on the mistakenly found outputs, it's clear that the previous attempts did not correctly handle the sequence calculation after the removal of one cube.

The primary issue is that the logic for determining the maximum sequence length after the removal of one cube needs to be more robust and correctly track the segments of contiguous colors.

Let's re-implement the solution with a different approach to correctly handle this problem:

1. **Track contiguous segments of each color.**
2. **Determine the maximum combined segment length after removing one cube.**

Here is the corrected approach:

        }
    }

    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second == max_count) {
            most_frequent_colors.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }
    std::sort(most_frequent_colors.begin(), most_frequent_colors.end());

                    max_length = std::max(max_length, previous_length + current_length);
                    previous_length = current_length;
                    current_length = 0;
                    used_removal = false;
                } else {
                    used_removal = true;
                    previous_length = current_length;
                    current_length = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        max_length = std::max(max_length, previous_length + current_length);

    }

    fout << max_sequence << '\n';

   - We then output these colors.

4. **Requirement 3:**
   - For each color from 1 to 10, we traverse the sequence of cubes.
   - We maintain `current_length` for the current segment length of the color.
   - We maintain `previous_length` to track the previous segment length.
   - We handle the removal of one cube by setting `used_removal` to true upon encountering a different color.
   - We update `max_length` whenever necessary and finally update `max_sequence` with the longest sequence found for any color.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle the removal of one cube to maximize the sequence length, addressing the issue that was previously encountered.

Thank you for your patience. I understand that there has been consistent trouble with the longest contiguous sequence calculation after removing one cube. Let's rethink the approach more methodically.

### Analysis of Previous Mistakes:
The previous attempts failed to correctly account for removing one element to maximize the sequence of same-colored cubes. The logic for merging segments wasn't sufficiently robust.

### Comprehensive Plan:
1. **Read input and count cubes by color.**
2. **Identify the unique colors and the most frequent color(s).**
3. **Calculate the longest contiguous sequence of the same color after removing one cube.**

For the longest sequence calculation:
- Iterate through each color.
- Track contiguous segments of the current color.
- Determine the maximum sequence length that can be obtained by removing one cube and merging two segments.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cuburi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cuburi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> colors(n);
    std::unordered_map<int, int> color_count;

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of cubes `n`.
   - We read the colors of the cubes into the vector `colors`.
   - We maintain a count of each color using an `unordered_map` called `color_count`.

2. **Requirement 1:**
   - The number of unique colors is given by the size of `color_count`.

3. **Requirement 2:**
   - We find the maximum count of any color.
   - We gather all colors that have this maximum count and sort them.
   - We then output these colors.

4. **Requirement 3:**
   - For each color from 1 to 10 (as colors are numbered from 1 to 10), we traverse the sequence of cubes.
   - We maintain `current_length` for the current segment length of the color.
   - We gather contiguous segments of the same color in the `segments` vector.
   - We handle the removal of one cube by merging two adjacent segments with one element in between.
   - We update `max_sequence` with the longest sequence found for any color.

This revised approach ensures that we correctly handle the removal of one cube to maximize the sequence length, addressing the previously encountered issues.

Thank you for your patience. It appears that the logic for correctly calculating the maximum length of contiguous cubes with one removal still has issues. Let's re-evaluate and fix this problem step-by-step.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of cubes `n` and their colors.
   - Maintain a count of each color using an unordered map.

2. **Requirement 1:**
   - Output the number of unique colors.

3. **Requirement 2:**
   - Find the color(s) with the maximum count and output them in ascending order.

4. **Requirement 3:**
   - Calculate the longest contiguous sequence of same-colored cubes after removing one cube:
     - Track all segments of contiguous cubes of each color.
     - Merge segments considering the removal of one cube and find the maximum length.

Let's implement this step-by-step approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cuburi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cuburi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    std::vector<int> colors(n);
    std::unordered_map<int, int> color_count;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> colors[i];
        ++color_count[colors[i]];
    }

    // Requirement 1: Number of unique colors
    fout << color_count.size() << '\n';

    // Requirement 2: Color with the most cubes
    int max_count = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second > max_count) {
            max_count = entry.second;
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> most_frequent_colors;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second == max_count) {
            most_frequent_colors.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }
    std::sort(most_frequent_colors.begin(), most_frequent_colors.end());

    for (int color : most_frequent_colors) {
        fout << color << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    // Requirement 3: Longest sequence of cubes of the same color
    int max_sequence = 0;

    for (int color = 1; color <= 10; ++color) {
        int current_length = 0;
        std::vector<int> segments;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (colors[i] == color) {
                current_length++;
            } else {
                if (current_length > 0) {
                    segments.push_back(current_length);
                }
                current_length = 0;
            }
        }

        if (current_length > 0) {
            segments.push_back(current_length);
        }

        if (!segments.empty()) {
            if (segments.size() == 1) {
                max_sequence = std::max(max_sequence, segments[0]);
            } else {
                for (size_t i = 0; i < segments.size() - 1; ++i) {
                    max_sequence = std::max(max_sequence, segments[i] + segments[i + 1] + 1);
                }
                max_sequence = std::max(max_sequence, *std::max_element(segments.begin(), segments.end()));
            }
        }
    }

    fout << max_sequence << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of cubes `n` and their colors into the vector `colors`.
   - Use an unordered map `color_count` to count occurrences of each color.

2. **Requirement 1:**
   - Output the size of `color_count`, representing the number of unique colors.

3. **Requirement 2:**
   - Iterate through `color_count` to find the maximum count.
   - Collect all colors with this maximum count, sort them, and output them.

4. **Requirement 3:**
   - For each color (1 to 10), we:
     - Track contiguous segments of this color in `segments`.
     - Calculate the longest sequence by considering all possible ways of merging segments with one cube removal.
   - Update `max_sequence` with the longest sequence found for any color.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle the removal of one cube to maximize the sequence length, addressing the previously encountered issues.

The discrepancy in the results indicates that the logic for calculating the longest contiguous sequence after removing one cube was still flawed. Specifically, the previous solution did not account correctly for the possibility of merging contiguous segments separated by a single different cube.

Let's reevaluate the problem step by step, ensuring we address all requirements correctly:

1. **Count unique colors.**
2. **Identify the most frequent color(s).**
3. **Calculate the longest contiguous sequence after potentially removing one cube.**

**Approach for Requirement 3:**
- Use a sliding window approach to evaluate segments of the same color and the effect of removing one cube.
- Maintain two lengths: one for the current contiguous segment and one for the longest sequence formed by merging two segments separated by one cube.

Let's implement this revised approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("cuburi.in");
    std::ofstream fout("cuburi.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> colors(n);
    std::unordered_map<int, int> color_count;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> colors[i];
        ++color_count[colors[i]];
    }

    // Requirement 1: Number of unique colors
    fout << color_count.size() << '\n';

    // Requirement 2: Color with the most cubes
    int max_count = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second > max_count) {
            max_count = entry.second;
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> most_frequent_colors;
    for (const auto& entry : color_count) {
        if (entry.second == max_count) {
            most_frequent_colors.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }
    std::sort(most_frequent_colors.begin(), most_frequent_colors.end());

    for (int color : most_frequent_colors) {
        fout << color << ' ';
    }
    fout << '\n';

    // Requirement 3: Longest sequence of cubes of the same color
    int max_sequence = 0;

    for (int color = 1; color <= 10; ++color) {
        int current_length = 0;
        int max_length = 0;
        int prev_length = 0;
        bool used_removal = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (colors[i] == color) {
                current_length++;
            } else {
                if (!used_removal) {
                    used_removal = true;
                    prev_length = current_length;
                    current_length = 0;
                } else {
                    max_length = std::max(max_length, prev_length + current_length + 1);
                    prev_length = current_length;
                    current_length = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        max_length = std::max(max_length, prev_length + current_length + (used_removal ? 1 : 0));
        max_sequence = std::max(max_sequence, max_length);
    }

    fout << max_sequence << '\n';

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of cubes `n`.
   - We read the colors of the cubes into the vector `colors`.
   - We maintain a count of each color using an `unordered_map` called `color_count`.

2. **Requirement 1:**
   - The number of unique colors is given by the size of `color_count`.

3. **Requirement 2:**
   - We find the maximum count of any color.
   - We gather all colors that have this maximum count and sort them.
   - We then output these colors.

4. **Requirement 3:**
   - For each color from 1 to 10 (as colors are numbered from 1 to 10), we traverse the sequence of cubes.
   - We use `current_length` to track the current segment length.
   - We use `prev_length` to track the previous segment length.
   - If a different color is encountered:
     - If it's the first different color (`used_removal` is `false`), we mark `used_removal` as `true` and save the `current_length` to `prev_length`.
     - If it's the second different color (`used_removal` is `true`), we calculate the potential maximum length by merging the previous and current segments with one cube removed.
   - We update `max_length` accordingly to ensure it holds the longest sequence considering the removal of one cube.
   - Finally, we update `max_sequence` with the longest sequence found for any color.

This approach should correctly handle the removal of one cube to maximize the sequence length and produce the expected results.
