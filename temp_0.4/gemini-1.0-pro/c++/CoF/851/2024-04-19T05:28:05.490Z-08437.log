Gigel este un pasionat al triunghiurilor. El colectează beţişoare de diferite lungimi şi le asamblează în diferite triunghiuri. Ieri, el avea $6$ beţişoare de lungimi $5$, $2$, $7$, $3$, $12$ şi $3$. Din aceste bețișoare, Gigel a construit un triunghi de laturi $3$, $3$ şi $5$, iar beţişoarele de lungimi $2$, $7$, $12$ au rămas nefolosite pentru că aceste lungimi nu pot forma laturile unui triunghi.

~[0.png]

Din acest motiv, Gigel s-a hotărât să facă o colecţie de beţişoare, dintre care oricum ar alege $3$ elemente, acestea să nu poată forma laturile unui triunghi, proprietate pe care o vom numi în continuare proprietate anti-triunghi. Gigel, pornind de la setul iniţial de lungimi $2, 7, 12$, s-a gândit la două metode de realizare a unei colecţii de $5$ beţişoare cu proprietatea anti-triunghi, şi anume:

1. Păstrează cel mai scurt beţişor, cel de lungime $2$, şi creează un set nou adăugând alte beţişoare de lungime mai mare sau egală cu cel iniţial. De exemplu, următoarele $5$ lungimi sunt corecte: $2, 2, 12, 50, 30$.
2. Păstreză toate beţişoarele, şi anume $2, 7, 12$, pe care le va completa cu alte beţişoare de diferite lungimi (mai scurte sau mai lungi), astfel ca proprietatea anti-triunghi să se păstreze. Următoarele $5$ lungimi respectă proprietatea anti-triunghi: $2, 7, 12, 4, 1$.

# Cerinţă

Cunoscând un şir de $n$ numere naturale nenule $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ având proprietatea anti-triunghi, şi un număr $k$ ($k>n$), se cere să construiţi un şir de $k$ numere naturale având proprietatea anti-triunghi, în conformitate cu una dintre următoarele două restricţii

1. **Varianta 1**: Cel mai mic element este identic cu cel mai mic element din şirul iniţial.
2. **Varianta 2**: Printre cele $k$ elemente ale şirului construit se regăsesc toate elementele şirului iniţial.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `triunghi.in` conţine pe prima linie valorile numerelor $v, n$ şi $k$, separate prin spaţiu. Linia următoare conţine $n$ numere naturale separate prin spaţiu, ce formează un şir cu propietatea anti-triunghi.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `triunghi.out` va conţine $k$ numere pe o singură linie. 

Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $1$, atunci fişierul va conţine $k$ numere naturale cu proprietatea anti-triunghi, separate prin spaţiu, în care cel mai mic element este identic cu minimul şirului dat în fişierul de intrare. 

Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $2$, atunci fişierul va conţine $k$ numere naturale cu proprietatea anti-triunghi, separate prin spaţiu, printre care se regăsesc toate elementele şirului iniţial. 


# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq n < k \leq 46$
* $1 \leq$ lungimea unui beţişor $\leq 2 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerinţe se acordă $30$ de puncte, iar pentru cerinţa a doua se acordă $70$ de puncte.
* Se garantează că întotdeauna există soluţie.
* Soluţia nu este unică - se admite orice răspuns corect.

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the output sequence must have the anti-triangle property. The anti-triangle property means that any three elements in the sequence cannot form the sides of a triangle.

To fix this issue, we can modify the solution as follows:

```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("triunghi.in");
    ofstream fout("triunghi.out");

    int v, n, k;
    fin >> v >> n >> k;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());

    if (v == 1) {
        int min_val = a[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            fout << min_val << " ";
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fout << a[i] << " ";
        }
        int remaining = k - n;
        int next_val = a[n - 1] + 1;
        while (remaining > 0) {
            if (next_val <= 2 * a[n - 1]) {
                fout << next_val << " ";
                remaining--;
            }
            next_val++;
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution first sorts the input sequence in ascending order. Then, it checks the value of `v`. If `v` is 1, it means that the output sequence must have the same minimum value as the input sequence. In this case, the solution simply outputs the minimum value `k` times.

If `v` is 2, it means that the output sequence must contain all the elements of the input sequence. In this case, the solution first outputs the elements of the input sequence. Then, it calculates the remaining number of elements that need to be added to the output sequence. The solution then iterates through the remaining elements and adds them to the output sequence one by one, starting from the smallest possible value that does not violate the anti-triangle property.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input sequence. The sorting operation takes O(n log n) time, and the remaining operations take O(n) time.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), since it uses a vector to store the input sequence.
