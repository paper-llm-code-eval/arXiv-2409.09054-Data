Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `fotbal.in` and write to `fotbal.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Cei $N$ copii de la școala generală vor să formeze o echipă de fotbal compusă din $K$ elevi, dintre care cel puțin unul stângaci și cel puțin unul dreptaci. Pentru fiecare copil $i$ (de la $0$ la $N-1$) se cunoaște intervalul de timp în care acesta este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, sub forma unei perechi, $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$, cât și dacă este stângaci sau dreptaci. $K$ copii pot juca în aceeași echipa dacă intervalele de timp în care aceștia sunt disponibili se suprapun în cel puțin un punct (moment de timp).

# Cerință

Se cere numărul de moduri în care se poate alcătui o echipă cu $K$ dintre cei $N$ elevi; deoarece acest număr poate să fie foarte mare, el se va afișa modulo $10^9+9$.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `fotbal.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc câte 3 numere naturale, $start_{i}$, $end_{i}$, $f_{i}$, unde $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$ reprezintă intervalul de timp în care al $i$-lea copil este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, iar $f_{i}$ reprezintă piciorul cu care joacă al $i$-lea copil, $f_{i}=1$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este dreptaci și $f_{i}=0$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este stângaci.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `fotbal.out` va conține doar numărul de moduri cerut, în forma precizată în cerință. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq start_{i} \leq end_{i} \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* $f_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $K = 2$ și $2 \le N \le 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $K = 2$ și există cel mult $5$ copii care sunt stângaci;
* Pentru $33$ de puncte, $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

1 8 0
2 5 1
3 7 0
0 9 1
6 12 0

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Evaluate the error message. Think of a solution to fix the program and return the entire source code with the fix.

---

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.
