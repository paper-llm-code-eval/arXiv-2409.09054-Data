Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `urgenta.in` and write to `urgenta.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Autorităţile dintr-o zonă de munte intenţionează să stabilească un plan de urgenţă, pentru a reacţiona mai eficient la frecventele calamităţi naturale din zonă. În acest scop au identificat $N$ puncte de interes strategic şi le-au numerotat distinct de la $1$ la $N$. Punctele de interes strategic sunt conectate prin $M$ căi de acces având priorităţi în funcţie de importanţă. Între oricare două puncte de interes strategic există cel mult o cale de acces ce poate fi parcursă în ambele sensuri şi cel puţin un drum (format din una sau mai multe căi de acces) ce le conectează. 

În cazul unei calamităţi unele căi de acces pot fi temporar întrerupte şi astfel între anumite puncte de interes nu mai există legătură. Ca urmare pot rezulta mai multe grupuri de puncte în aşa fel încât între oricare două puncte din acelaşi grup să existe măcar un drum şi între oricare două puncte din grupuri diferite să nu existe drum. 

Autorităţile estimează gravitatea unei calamităţi ca fiind suma priorităţilor căilor de acces distruse de aceasta şi doresc să determine un scenariu de gravitate maximă, în care punctele de interes strategic să fie împărţite într-un număr de $K$ grupuri.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `urgenta.in` are următorul format:
$N\ M\ K$
$i_1 \; j_1 \; p_1 $ – între punctele $i_1$ şi $j_1$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_1$
$i_2 \; j_2 \; p_2 $ – între punctele $i_2$ şi $j_2$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_2$
...
$i_M \; j_M \; p_M $ – între punctele $i_M$ şi $j_M$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_M$

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `urgenta.out` va avea următorul format:
$\text{gravmax}$ – gravitatea maximă
$C$	– numărul de căi de acces întrerupte de calamitate
$k_1 \; h_1$ – între punctele $k_1$ şi $h_1$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
$k_2 \; h_2$ – între punctele $k_2$ şi $h_2$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
...
$k_C \; h_C$ – între punctele $k_C$ şi $h_C$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 \leq N \leq 255$
* $N - 1 \leq M \leq 32 \ 384$
* $1 \leq K \leq N$
* Priorităţile căilor de acces sunt întregi strict pozitivi mai mici decât $256$.
* Un grup de puncte poate conţine între $1$ şi $N$ puncte inclusiv.
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul va determina una singură.

```

Evaluate the error message. Think of a solution to fix the program and return the entire source code with the fix.

---

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.
