În anul $2214$ a izbucnit primul război interstelar. Pământul a fost atacat de către $n$ civilizații extraterestre, pe care le vom numerota pentru simplicitate de la $1$ la $n$.

Pentru a se apăra, pământenii au inventat o armă specială ce poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, fabricate dintr-un material special denumit narun. Dacă arma este programată la nivelul $p$, atunci un proiectil de greutate $k$ va ajunge exact la distanța $k^p$ km ($k$ la puterea $p$) față de Pământ și dacă în acel punct se află cartierul general al unui atacator, acesta va fi distrus. De exemplu, dacă arma este programată la nivelul $2$, un proiectil de greutate 10 va distruge cartierul general al extratereștrilor situat la distanța $10^2 = 100$ km de Pământ.
Arma poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, dar cum narunul este un material foarte rar și foarte scump, pământenii vor să folosească proiectile cât mai ușoare pentru a distruge cartierele generale inamice.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se $n$, numărul atacatorilor, precum și cele $n$ distanțe până la cartierele generale ale acestora, să se scrie un program care determină:

1. Cantitatea minimă de narun necesară pentru a distruge toate cartierele generale inamice;
2. Nivelurile la care trebuie programată arma, pentru a distruge fiecare cartier general inamic cu o cantitate minimă de narun.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arma.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $c$ reprezentând cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Pe cea de a doua linie se află numărul natural $n$, reprezentând numărul atacatorilor. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se află $n$ numere naturale, câte un număr pe o linie; pe cea de a $i$-a linie dintre cele $n$ se află distanța față de Pământ a cartierului general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre

# Date de ieșire

Dacă cerința $c = 1$, atunci pe prima linie a fișierului `arma.out` va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cantitatea minimă de narun necesară distrugerii tuturor cartierelor generale inamice.

Dacă cerința este $c = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `arma.out` va conține $n$ linii. Pe a $i$-a linie se va scrie nivelul la care trebuie programată arma pentru a distruge cartierul general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Distanțele până la cartierele generale inamice sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru $50$% dintre teste cerința este $1$.

The error message indicates that the `sqrt` function was not declared in the current scope. To fix this, we need to include the necessary header file that declares the `sqrt` function. In this case, the header file is `<cmath>`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("arma.in");
  ofstream out("arma.out");

  int c;
  in >> c;

  int n;
  in >> n;

  vector<long long> dist(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    in >> dist[i];
  }

  sort(dist.begin(), dist.end());

  if (c == 1) {
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long sqrt_dist = (long long)sqrt(dist[i]);
      if (sqrt_dist * sqrt_dist == dist[i]) {
        sum += sqrt_dist;
      } else {
        sum += sqrt_dist + 1;
      }
    }
    out << sum << endl;
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long sqrt_dist = (long long)sqrt(dist[i]);
      if (sqrt_dist * sqrt_dist == dist[i]) {
        out << sqrt_dist << endl;

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result is much larger than the expected result. This is because the program is not correctly calculating the minimum amount of narun needed to destroy all the enemy headquarters.

The program is currently calculating the sum of the square roots of the distances to each enemy headquarters. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the minimum amount of narun needed. The correct way to calculate the minimum amount of narun needed is to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $k^2$ is greater than or equal to the distance to each enemy headquarters.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream in("arma.in");
  ofstream out("arma.out");

  int c;
  in >> c;

  int n;
  in >> n;

  vector<long long> dist(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    in >> dist[i];
  }

  sort(dist.begin(), dist.end());

  if (c == 1) {
    long long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long k = (long long)ceil(sqrt(dist[i]));
      sum += k;
    }
    out << sum << endl;
  } else {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      long long k = (long long)ceil(sqrt(dist[i]));
      out << k << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
