Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `alinieri.in` and write to `alinieri.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră modelul unui sistem solar format din $N$ planete care se rotesc în jurul unei stele $S$, în sens trigonometric. Traiectoriile planetelor se consideră circulare și de raze diferite, iar vitezele de rotație ale planetelor în jurul stelei sunt numere naturale și sunt exprimate în grade pe zi ($\degree$/zi).

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de planete $N$ și vitezele lor de rotație $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, precum și două numere naturale $P$ și $Z$, să se determine numărul $A$ de alinieri a câte minimum $P$ planete, pe o dreaptă ce trece prin centrul stelei $S$, după trecerea celor $Z$ zile. Evoluția sistemului solar începe cu toate planetele așezate orizontal, în dreapta stelei $S$.
\
Spre exemplu, pentru $N=4$, $P=3$, $Z=365$ și $V = [20, 11, 8, 6]$, alinierea a minimum $3$ planete din cele $4$ se va face la finalul zilelor $60$, $90$, $120$, $180$, $240$, $270$, $300$, $360$. După $365$ de zile vor exista $A=8$ alinieri. În imaginea din dreapta se observă poziția planetelor la prima aliniere.
~[1.jpg|align=center|width=55em]

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `alinieri.in` conține pe prima linie, în această ordine, numerele naturale $N$, $P$ și $Z$, iar pe a doua linie, $N$ numere naturale $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$ cu semnificația de mai sus. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `alinieri.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul $A$, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq P \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Z \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq V_i \leq 10^3$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq Z \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $2 \leq P \leq 9$.
- Se vor lua în considerare doar alinierile de la sfârșitul fiecărei zile (ora 24:00), când planetele și-au încheiat parcursul zilnic.

The bug in the previous solution was that it only counted the number of days when at least `p` planets were aligned, but it didn't take into account the fact that the planets could be aligned multiple times on the same day.

Here is the fixed solution:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

ifstream in("alinieri.in");
ofstream out("alinieri.out");

int main() {
    int n, p, z;
    in >> n >> p >> z;
    vector<int> v(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) in >> v[i];
    map<int, int> cnt;
    for (int i = 0; i < z; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) cnt[i * v[j] % 360]++;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (auto it : cnt) {
        if (it.second >= p) ans++;
    }
    out << ans << '\n';
    return 0;
}

The previous output of `96` was incorrect because it counted the number of times that at least `p` planets were aligned, regardless of whether or not they were aligned on the same day. The correct output is `8`, which is the number of days when at least `p` planets are aligned on the same day.
