Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `exponent.in` and write to `exponent.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

---

Se dă un număr natural $n$ și o cifră $k$ din mulțimea $\{2, 3, 5, 7\}$.

# Cerință

Se cere să se afișeze exponentul lui $k$ în descompunerea în factori primi a produsului $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `exponent.in` conține pe prima linie $n$ și $k$.


# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `exponent.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural, adică exponentul cerut de problemă.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $k = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$;

---

Example:
`exponent.in`
```
6 3
```

`exponent.out`
```
2
```

The exit code 137 is caused by a segmentation fault. This means that the program tried to access memory that it was not allowed to access. In this case, the most likely cause is that the vector `p` is out of bounds.

To fix the program, we need to make sure that we only access valid indices of the vector `p`. We can do this by checking the size of the vector before accessing any of its elements.

Here is the fixed code:
```c++
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream in("exponent.in");
    ofstream out("exponent.out");
    int n, k;
    in >> n >> k;
    vector<int> p = {2, 3, 5, 7};
    int exp = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++) {
        if (p[i] == k) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                while (j % p[i] == 0) {
                    exp++;
                    j /= p[i];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    out << exp << "\n";
    return 0;
}
