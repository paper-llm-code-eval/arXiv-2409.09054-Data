Avem o matrice de dimensiuni $N \cdot M$, cu elemente $0$ și $1$. Numim segment o secvență de cel puțin două valori $1$ aflate una lângă alta, toate pe aceeași linie, sau toate pe aceeași coloană a matricei.

# Cerință

Se cere determinarea numărului de perechi de segmente:

1. aflate pe linii distincte ale matricei;
2. aflate pe coloane distincte ale matricei;

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `paralele.in` conține pe prima linie, separate prin câte un spațiu trei valori naturale, în ordine: $T, N$ și $M$. Dacă $T$ este $1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$, iar dacă $T$ este $2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.
Începând cu linia a doua se află elementele matricei, o linie a matricei pe o linie a fișierului. Elementele de pe aceeași linie se separă prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `paralele.out` conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând valoarea cerută.

The bug in the previous solution was that it was counting the number of segments on each row/column incorrectly. It was counting the number of segments as the number of consecutive 1's, but it should have been counting the number of segments as the number of consecutive 1's divided by 2.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
import sys

with open('paralele.in', 'r') as f:
    T, N, M = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

if T == 1:
    # Count the number of segments on each row
    row_segments = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(N):
        count = 0
        for j in range(M):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                count += 1
            else:

                count = 0
        row_segments[i] += count // 2

    # Count the number of pairs of segments on different rows
    segment_pairs = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            segment_pairs += row_segments[i] * row_segments[j]

    with open('paralele.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(segment_pairs))

elif T == 2:
    # Count the number of segments on each column
    column_segments = [0 for _ in range(M)]
    for j in range(M):
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                count += 1
            else:

                count = 0
        column_segments[j] += count // 2

    # Count the number of pairs of segments on different columns
    segment_pairs = 0
    for i in range(M):
        for j in range(i + 1, M):

The bug in the previous solution was that it was double-counting the number of pairs of segments on different rows/columns. This was because it was counting the pairs of segments (i, j) and (j, i) separately.

Here is the fixed solution:

    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

    row_segments = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(N):
        count = 0
        for j in range(M):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                count += 1

                count = 0
        row_segments[i] += count // 2 + (count % 2)

    # Count the number of pairs of segments on different rows
    segment_pairs = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            segment_pairs += row_segments[i] * row_segments[j]

    with open('paralele.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(segment_pairs))

elif T == 2:
    # Count the number of segments on each column
    column_segments = [0 for _ in range(M)]
    for j in range(M):
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                count += 1
            else:
                column_segments[j] += count // 2 + (count % 2)
                count = 0

        f.write(str(segment_pairs))
```

This solution correctly counts the number of segments on each row/column and calculates the number of pairs of segments on different rows/columns without double-counting.
