Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `leftmax.in` and write to `leftmax.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În clasa lui *Dexter* sunt $N$ elevi de înălțimi distincte. La ora de sport, ei sunt așezați în linie, de la stânga la dreapta. Profesorul lor, *Johnny*, va selecta pentru un exercițiu elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive în linie, astfel încât cel mai înalt elev dintre cei selectați să se afle în prima jumătate a acestora.

De exemplu, dacă elevii au, în ordine, înălțimile $1$, $5$, $4$, atunci profesorul poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $5$ și $4$, dar nu poate să îi selecteze pe cei cu înălțimile $1$ și $5$. Desigur, există mai multe moduri de a selecta elevii astfel încât să fie satisfăcută condiția de mai sus. Profesorul *Johnny* ar vrea să afle în câte moduri se poate face acest lucru.

# Cerinţă
Dându-se $N$ și înălțimile elevilor din clasă, aflați în câte moduri pot fi selectați oricâți elevi aflați pe poziții consecutive, astfel încât să fie îndeplinită condiția din enunț.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `leftmax.in` conține, pe prima linie, numărul $N$, iar pe a doua linie înălțimile elevilor în ordinea în care sunt așezați în linie.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `leftmax.out` conține pe prima linie răspunsul la cerință, sub formă de rest al împărțirii la $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$ ($\text{modulo }1\ 000\ 000\ 007$).

# Restricţii și precizări
- $1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Înălțimea oricărui elev este un număr întreg cuprins între $1$ și $N$, inclusiv.
- Dacă se selectează un număr impar de elevi, atunci considerăm că cel din mijlocul selecției se află în prima jumătate a elevilor selectați.
- Pentru 10 puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$ și elevii sunt ordonați descrescător după înălțime.
- Pentru alte 35 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru alte 20 de puncte, $N \leq 30\ 000$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open("leftmax.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    heights = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

dp = [0] * n
dp[0] = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if heights[i] >= heights[i - 1]:
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
    else:
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

with open("leftmax.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(dp[n - 1] % 1000000007))

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the height of the current student is less than the height of the previous student. In this case, the number of ways to select students is the sum of the number of ways to select students ending with the previous student and the number of ways to select students ending with the student before the previous student.

Here is the corrected solution:
```python
with open("leftmax.in", "r") as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    heights = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

dp = [0] * n
dp[0] = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if heights[i] >= heights[i - 1]:
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
    else:
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007

with open("leftmax.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(dp[n - 1]))

The issue with the previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when the height of the current student is equal to the height of the previous student. In this case, the number of ways to select students is the same as the number of ways to select students ending with the previous student.
