Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `panglica.in` and write to `panglica.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Gigel are o panglică alcătuită din benzi de $1 cm$ lăţime, colorate în diverse culori. Panglica are $N$ benzi, fiecare colorată cu una din $C$ culori, culori pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $C$. Gigel vrea ca la ambele capete ale panglicii să aibă aceeaşi culoare, dar cum nu poate schimba culorile benzilor, singura posibilitate rămâne tăierea unor bucăţi de la capete. 

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine modul de tăiere a panglicii astfel încât la cele două capete să fie benzi de aceeaşi culoare, iar lungimea panglicii obţinute să fie maximă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `panglica.in` conţine:

- pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ şi $C$ separate printr-un spaţiu;
- pe următoarele $N$ linii descrierea panglicii: pe fiecare linie un număr natural de la $1$ la $C$, reprezentând în ordine culorile fâşiilor ce alcătuiesc panglica.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `panglica.out` va conţine următoarele $4$ numere:

- pe prima linie numărul de fâşii rămase;
- pe linia a doua numărul culorii care se află la capete;
- pe linia a treia câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la începutul panglicii iniţiale;
- pe linia a patra câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la sfârşitul panglicii iniţiale

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq C \leq 200$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii alegeţi pe cea în care se taie cât mai puţin din partea de început a panglicii.

The program exited with code 1 because the file `panglica.out` was closed before trying to write to it. To fix this, we need to keep the file open until after we have finished writing to it.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('panglica.in') as f, open('panglica.out', 'w') as g:
    n, c = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = [int(f.readline()) for _ in range(n)]

    freq = [0] * (c + 1)
    for x in a:
        freq[x] += 1

    for i in range(1, c + 1):
        if freq[i] > 0:
            start = i
            break

    for i in range(c, 0, -1):
        if freq[i] > 0:
            end = i
            break

    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == start:
            cnt += 1
        elif a[i] == end:
            break

    g.write(f'{n - cnt}\n{start}\n{cnt}\n{n - cnt - freq[start]}')

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result has the start and end colors swapped. This is because the code was incorrectly finding the start color as the first non-zero color in the frequency array, and the end color as the last non-zero color in the frequency array. However, the start color should be the first non-zero color in the array, and the end color should be the last non-zero color in the array.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('panglica.in') as f, open('panglica.out', 'w') as g:
    n, c = map(int, f.readline().split())
    a = [int(f.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
