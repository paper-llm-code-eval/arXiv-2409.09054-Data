Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `cod.in` and write to `cod.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Dexter a moștenit o avere fabuloasă, dar este închisă într-un seif. Unchiul său, cel care i-a lăsat averea, a dorit să îl pună la încercare astfel: a umplut o cutie foarte mare cu bilețele pe care sunt scrise numere naturale din mulțimea $\{0, 1, 2, \dots, 99\}$. Pe fiecare bilețel este scris un singur număr. Dexter trebuie să formeze perechi de bilețele care au scrise pe ele același număr. La sfârșit, vor rămâne câteva bilețele fără pereche. Codul de acces la seif este format din numerele rămase pe bilețelele fără pereche, așezate în ordine crescătoare și fără spațiu între ele.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să furnizeze codul de acces la seif.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural n, reprezentând numărul bilețelelor aflate în cutie. Pe următoarea linie a fișierului se află cele n numere scrise pe bilețele, separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` va conține pe prima linie numerele din care este compus codul, în ordine crescătoare și fără spații între ele.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 90 \ 000$;

Example:
`cod.in`
```
10
11 3 11 11 12 2 11 12 3 11
```

`cod.out`
```
211
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open('cod.in') as fin, open('cod.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    nums = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    nums.sort()
    fout.write(''.join(map(str, nums[i] for i in range(n) if nums[i] != nums[(i + 1) % n])))
```

Program exited with code 1.
stdout:
```

```
stderr:
```
  File "/app/app.py", line 5
    fout.write(''.join(map(str, nums[i] for i in range(n) if nums[i] != nums[(i + 1) % n])))
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Generator expression must be parenthesized

```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.
Implement a solution to fix the program

The error is caused by a syntax error in the line:

```python
fout.write(''.join(map(str, nums[i] for i in range(n) if nums[i] != nums[(i + 1) % n])))
```

The generator expression `nums[i] for i in range(n) if nums[i] != nums[(i + 1) % n]` must be parenthesized.

The correct code is:

```python
with open('cod.in') as fin, open('cod.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    nums = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    nums.sort()
    fout.write(''.join(map(str, (nums[i] for i in range(n) if nums[i] != nums[(i + 1) % n]))))

Program result did not match expected result.
Input data:
```
10
11 3 11 11 12 2 11 12 3 11
```
Expected output:
```
211
```
Found output:
```

Evaluate the differences between the expected and found result.
Write a comprehensive explanation of why the results differ.
If the solution has a bug fix it, else reimplement it using a different algorithm or data structure.

The difference between the expected and found result is that the found result includes the number `3` twice, while the expected result includes it only once.

The reason for this is that the code does not correctly handle the case when the last element in the list is not paired with the first element.

The correct code is:

```python
with open('cod.in') as fin, open('cod.out', 'w') as fout:
    n = int(fin.readline())
    nums = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    nums.sort()
    fout.write(''.join(map(str, (nums[i] for i in range(n) if nums[i] != nums[(i + 1) % n] or i == n - 1))))
```

This code adds a check to see if the last element in the list is not paired with the first element. If it is not paired, then the last element is included in the output.
