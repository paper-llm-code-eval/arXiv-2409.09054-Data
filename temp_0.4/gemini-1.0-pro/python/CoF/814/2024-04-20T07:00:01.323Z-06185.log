Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `comp.in` and write to `comp.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Locuitorii planetei Eudora folosesc o reprezentare mai ciudată a numerelor naturale, astfel că orice număr natural va fi scris notând câte mii, sute, zeci, respectiv unități conține acesta. De exemplu, numărul $3207$ se poate reprezenta în mai multe moduri echivalente: $3m2s7u$ ($3$ mii $2$ sute și $7$ unități), $32s0z7u$ ($32$ sute $0$ zeci și $7$ unități), $32s7u$, $3207u$, etc.

Pentru a compara două numere naturale, eudorienii folosesc semnele `<` și `>`, acestea având semnificația cunoscută și pe Terra, iar pentru a calcula suma a două numere naturale utilizează semnul `+`.

Pentru a testa abilitățile pământenilor în privința lucrului cu numere naturale, eudorienii au trimis pe Terra un fișier text ce conține $N$ linii, fiecare linie fiind o comparație de forma: `expresie1 > expresie2` sau `expresie1 < expresie2`.

Observați că o comparație este constituită din două expresii separate prin semnul < sau prin semnul >.

O expresie este compusă dintr-un număr natural sau dintr-o sumă de două sau mai multe numere naturale, toate scrise în forma eudoriană. Fișierul nu conține caractere spațiu.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină câte dintre comparațiile date utilizează semnul <, precum și valoarea de adevăr a fiecărei comparații dintre cele $N$ date (afișând $0$ dacă acea comparație e falsă, respectiv $1$ dacă acea comparație e adevărată).

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `comp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural nenul $N$, reprezentând numărul de comparații, iar pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii câte un șir de caractere corespunzător unei comparații.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `comp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de comparații în care se utilizează semnul <. Urmează $N$ linii, fiecare linie conținând doar valoarea $0$ sau valoarea $1$. Valoarea de pe a i-a linie dintre cele $N$ este $0$, dacă cea de-a i-a comparație din fișierul de intrare este falsă, respectiv $1$ în caz contrar.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Numerele din fișier nu depășesc în valoare numărul eudorian $1000m1000s1000z1000u$.
* Lungimea fiecărei linii din fișier este cel mult $250$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
with open('comp.in', 'r') as f_in, open('comp.out', 'w') as f_out:
    N = int(f_in.readline())
    count_less = 0
    for line in f_in:
        a, b = line.split('>')
        if a < b:
            count_less += 1
            f_out.write('1\n')
        else:
            f_out.write('0\n')
    f_out.write(str(count_less) + '\n')
```

The error message:
```
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```
means that the line:
```python
a, b = line.split('>')
```
is trying to unpack two values from the result of `line.split('>')`, but the result contains only one value. This happens when the line does not contain the `>` character.

To fix this, we can add a check to make sure that the line contains the `>` character before splitting it:
```python
if '>' in line:
    a, b = line.split('>')
else:
    a, b = line.split('<')
```

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('comp.in', 'r') as f_in, open('comp.out', 'w') as f_out:
    N = int(f_in.readline())
    count_less = 0
    for line in f_in:
        if '>' in line:
            a, b = line.split('>')
        else:
            a, b = line.split('<')
        if a < b:
            count_less += 1
            f_out.write('1\n')
        else:
            f_out.write('0\n')
    f_out.write(str(count_less) + '\n')

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found output incorrectly claims that the second comparison is true, when it is actually false.

The reason for this is that the code does not correctly handle the case where the two expressions in a comparison have different numbers of terms. In the second comparison, the left-hand side has 4 terms, while the right-hand side has 5 terms. The code incorrectly compares the first 4 terms of the left-hand side to the first 4 terms of the right-hand side, and since the first 4 terms are equal, it incorrectly concludes that the comparison is true.

To fix this, the code needs to compare the two expressions term by term, and only consider the comparison to be true if all of the terms are equal.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
with open('comp.in', 'r') as f_in, open('comp.out', 'w') as f_out:
    N = int(f_in.readline())
    count_less = 0
    for line in f_in:
        if '>' in line:
            a, b = line.split('>')
        else:
            a, b = line.split('<')
        a_terms = a.split('+')
        b_terms = b.split('+')
        if len(a_terms) != len(b_terms):
            f_out.write('0\n')
            continue
        for i in range(len(a_terms)):
            if a_terms[i] != b_terms[i]:
                f_out.write('0\n')
                break
        else:
            f_out.write('1\n')
            if '>' in line:
