Construcția unei noi clădiri a fost finalizată! Frank, celebrul arhitect a  făcut o poză cu fațada. Nu este chiar mulțumit de poză deoarece a observat o înclinație a pozei relativ la orizontală. Asta se poate repara printr-o rotație, iar Frank se întreabă dacă procesul de îndreptare nu ar putea fi automatizat.

Cu acest scop, imaginea este transformată într-o mulțime de segmente din plan, detectate automat cu algoritmi speciali, ca în imaginea din dreapta. Segmentele care se obțin sunt identificate prin cele două extremități, puncte având coordonate numere naturale, în sistemul *xOy*: ($x_1$, $y_1$), ($x_2$, $y_2$). Un segment este numit *aliniat* cu axele dacă este orizontal (paralel cu axa *Ox*, deci $y_1=y_2$) sau vertical (paralel cu axa *Oy*, deci $x_1=x_2$).
Prin rotația imaginii în ansamblu, o parte dintre segmente devin *aliniate* cu cele două axe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru o mulțime de segmente determină numărul maxim de segmente care se pot *alinia*, prin rotirea cu un același unghi a tuturor segmentelor. Unghiul de rotație poate fi orice număr real.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `arhitect.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul de segmente $N$ și pe următoarele $N$ linii câte patru numere întregi separate prin câte un spațiu $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, în această ordine, cu semnificația din enunț, coordonatele ce definesc extremitățile segmentelor.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `arhitect.out` conține pe prima linie numărul maxim de segmente determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$ și $1 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;
* Toate segmentele au lungime nenulă;
* Pentru $40$ de puncte, segmentele inițiale sunt paralele cu *Ox*, *Oy* sau cu bisectoarele axelor de coordonate.
* Pentru $60$ de puncte, fără resticții suplimentare.

The bug in the previous solution was that it did not handle the case when the last segment had the same angle as the previous segment. This caused the `max_aligned` variable to be updated incorrectly.

Here is the fixed solution:

            x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, fin.readline().split())
            segments.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))

    # Calculate the angle of rotation for each segment
    angles = []
    for segment in segments:
        dx, dy = segment[1][0] - segment[0][0], segment[1][1] - segment[0][1]
        if dx == 0:
            angles.append(pi / 2)
