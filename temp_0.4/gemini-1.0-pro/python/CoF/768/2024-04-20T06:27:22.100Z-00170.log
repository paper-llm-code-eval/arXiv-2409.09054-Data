Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `alee.in` and write to `alee.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Parcul oraşului a fost neglijat mult timp, astfel că acum toate aleile sunt distruse. Prin urmare, anul acesta Primăria şi-a propus să facă reamenajări. 

Parcul are forma unui pătrat cu latura de $n$ metri şi este înconjurat de un gard care are exact două porţi. Proiectanţii de la Primărie au realizat o hartă a parcului şi au trasat pe hartă un caroiaj care împarte parcul în $n \times n$ zone pătrate cu latura de $1$ metru. Astfel harta parcului are aspectul unei matrice pătratice cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane. Liniile şi respectiv coloanele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$. Elementele matricei corespund zonelor pătrate de latură $1$ metru. O astfel de zonă poate să conţină un copac sau este liberă.

Edilii oraşului doresc să paveze cu un număr minim de dale pătrate cu latura de $1$ metru zonele libere (fără copaci) ale parcului, astfel încât să se obţină o alee continuă de la o poartă la alta.

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine numărul minim de dale necesare pentru construirea unei alei continue de la o poartă la cealaltă.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `alee.in` conţine pe prima linie două valori naturale $n$ şi $m$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând dimensiunea parcului, respectiv numărul de copaci care se găsesc în parc. Fiecare dintre următoarele $m$ linii conţine câte două numere naturale $x$ şi $y$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând poziţiile copacilor în parc ($x$ reprezintă linia, iar $y$ reprezintă coloana zonei în care se află copacul). Ultima linie a fişierului conţine patru numere naturale $x_1 \ y_1 \ x_2 \ y_2$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând poziţiile celor două porţi ($x_1$, $y_1$ reprezintă linia şi respectiv coloana zonei ce conţine prima poartă, iar $x_2$, $y_2$ reprezintă linia şi respectiv coloana zonei ce  conţine cea de a doua poartă). 

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `alee.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural care reprezintă numărul minim de dale necesare pentru construirea aleii. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 175$
* $1 \leq m < n \cdot n$
*	Aleea este continuă dacă oricare două plăci consecutive au o latură comună.
*	Aleea începe cu zona unde se găseşte prima poartă şi se termină cu zona unde se găseşte cea de a doua poartă. 
*	Poziţiile porţilor sunt distincte şi corespund unor zone libere.
*	Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not correctly handle the case where the starting and ending points were on opposite sides of the park. In this case, the minimum number of tiles needed is the sum of the distances from the starting point to the left or right edge of the park and from the ending point to the opposite edge of the park, but the previous solution would output the minimum of these two distances.

Here is a fixed version of the solution:

This solution correctly handles the case where the starting and ending points are on opposite sides of the park by finding the minimum of the distances from the starting point to the left or right edge of the park and from the ending point to the opposite edge of the park.
