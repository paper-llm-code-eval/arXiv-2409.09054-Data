Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `puncte.in` and write to `puncte.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Andrei se descurcă foarte bine la geometrie și de aceea născocește tot felul de jocuri pe care le testează cu Alexandru, colegul său de bancă. Pentru a pregăti noul joc cu trei niveluri, Andrei desenează pe o foaie de matematică reperul cartezian xOy și mai multe puncte distincte. Fiecare punct desenat are atât abscisa $x$, cât și ordonata $y$, numere întregi.

La primul nivel, Alexandru determină numărul maxim de puncte (dintre cele desenate) aflate pe una dintre axele sistemului cartezian sau pe o dreaptă paralelă cu una dintre cele două axe.

La al doilea nivel, Alexandru consideră toate punctele desenate a căror abscisă $x$ și ordonată $y$ verifică cel puțin una dintre relațiile $x = y$ sau $x + y = 0$ și apoi calculează câte drepte distincte trec prin cel puțin două dintre aceste puncte.

La al treilea nivel, Alexandru numără și șterge punctele din $3$ în $3$ (primul, al $4$-lea, al $7$-lea etc.), începând cu cel mai din stânga punct desenat și continuând către dreapta. Dacă două sau mai multe puncte au aceeași abscisă, el le numără pe acestea de jos în sus (începând de la punctul cu ordonata cea mai mică). Când a ajuns cu număratul la cel mai din dreapta punct continuă cu cel mai din stânga punct rămas.

Alexandru se oprește cu numărarea și ștergerea când rămâne un singur punct desenat pe foaie.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește numărul natural nenul $N$, apoi cele $2 \cdot N$ numere întregi ce reprezintă coordonatele celor $N$ puncte și determină:

* $NRP$, numărul maxim de puncte (dintre cele desenate) aflate pe una dintre axele sistemului cartezian sau pe o dreaptă paralelă cu una dintre cele două axe;
* $NRD$, numărul de drepte distincte care trec prin cel puțin două dintre punctele desenate a căror abscisa $x$ și ordonată $y$ verifică cel puțin una dintre relațiile $x = y$ sau $x + y = 0$
* $XP$ reprezentând abscisa punctului rămas pe foaie la sfârșitul celui de-al treilea nivel al jocului.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `puncte.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $N$ de puncte, iar pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii, câte două numere întregi, despărțite printr-un spațiu, reprezentând, în ordine, abscisa și ordonata unui punct din plan.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `puncte.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul natural $NRP$, pe a doua linie numărul natural $NRD$, iar pe a treia linie numărul întreg ce reprezintă coordonata $XP$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $5 \leq N \leq 250 \ 000$;
* coordonatele punctelor sunt numere întregi ce au maximum $3$ cifre;
* Se acordă $20$ % din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a punctului a), $20$ % din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a punctului b) și $60$ % din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a punctului c).

The bug in the previous solution was that it didn't correctly update the `remaining_point` variable when deleting points in groups of 3. Specifically, it didn't consider the case where the leftmost point was also the bottommost point in a group of 3.

Here is the fixed version of the code:
```python
import sys

# Read input data
with open('puncte.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    points = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

max_on_line = 0
num_lines = 0
num_deleted = 0
remaining_point = None

# Iterate over points and count points on lines
for point in points:
    x, y = point
    if x == 0 or y == 0 or x == y or x + y == 0:
        max_on_line = max(max_on_line, 1)

# Count lines through points on diagonals

    x, y = point
    if x == y or x + y == 0:
        num_lines += 1

# Delete points in groups of 3
while num_deleted < n:
    # Find the leftmost point
    leftmost_point = None
    for point in points:
        if leftmost_point is None or point[0] < leftmost_point[0]:
            leftmost_point = point

    # Find the bottommost point in the group of 3
    bottommost_point = leftmost_point
    for point in points:
