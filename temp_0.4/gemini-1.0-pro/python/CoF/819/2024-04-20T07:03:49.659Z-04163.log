Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `alice.in` and write to `alice.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Într-o zi frumoasă de vară, Alice se juca în parc. Deodată, văzu un iepure cu ceas, numit Iepurele Alb, sărind grăbit în scorbura unui copac. Curioasă, Alice îl urmări şi sări şi ea în scorbură. Spre mirarea ei, ajunse într-o sală mare cu $N$ uşi încuiate. Pe fiecare uşă era scris câte un număr natural. Într-o clipă, lângă ea apăru Iepurele Alb şi-i spuse că doar uşile cu numere magice pot fi deschise dacă are cheile potrivite. Pentru a o ajuta, Iepurele Alb i-a explicat că un număr magic este un număr natural care poate fi redus la o cifră prin complementarea cifrelor acestuia faţă de cifra sa maximă din scrierea zecimală, apoi prin complementarea cifrelor numărului obţinut faţă de cifra sa maximă şi aşa mai departe până când se obţine o cifră. Evident, nu toate numerele naturale sunt numere magice. De exemplu, uşa cu numărul $1234$ poate fi deschisă cu cheia inscripţionată cu cifra $1$ deoarece $1234$ este un număr magic ce poate fi redus la cifra $1$ prin complementări repetate ($1234 \rightarrow 3210 \rightarrow 123 \rightarrow 210 \rightarrow 12 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 1$), iar uşa cu numărul $1204$ nu poate fi deschisă deoarece $1204$ nu este un număr magic (indiferent de câte ori s-ar repeta complementarea nu poate fi redus la o cifră: $1204 \rightarrow 3240 \rightarrow 1204 \rightarrow 3240 \rightarrow 1204 \rightarrow ...$ ).

Înainte să dispară, Iepurele Alb îi dădu o cheie aurie inscripţionată cu cifra $K$ şi o avertiză că poate deschide cu această cheie doar uşile cu numere magice ce pot fi reduse la cifra $K$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să citească numerele naturale $N$, $K$ şi cele $N$ numere naturale scrise pe cele $N$ uşi, şi care să determine:

* cel mai mare număr par dintre numerele scrise pe cele $N$ uşi;
* numărul uşilor care pot fi deschise cu cheia aurie inscripţionată cu cifra $K$.

# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `alice.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ şi $K$ și pe cea de-a doua linie $N$ numere naturale reprezentând numerele scrise pe cele $N$ uşi.


# Date de ieșire

Programul va afișa in fișierul de ieșire `alice.out`, în această ordine:

* pe prima linie, un număr natural reprezentând cel mai mare număr par dintre numerele scrise pe cele $N$ uşi;
* pe cea de-a doua linie, un număr natural reprezentând numărul uşilor care pot fi deschise cu cheia aurie inscripţionată cu cifra $K$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $7 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq K \leq 9$;
* complementarea cifrelor unui număr natural faţă de cifra sa maximă din scrierea zecimală constă în înlocuirea fiecărei cifre $c$ din număr cu diferenţa dintre cifra maximă şi cifra $c$; de exemplu, cifra maximă a numărului $1234$ este $4$ iar prin complementare se înlocuieşte cifra $1$ cu $3$, cifra $2$ cu $2$, cifra $3$ cu $1$ şi cifra $4$ cu $0$ rezultând numărul $3210$;
* pe fiecare uşă este scris un singur număr natural;
* există cel puţin o uşă pe care este scris un număr par;
* numărul scris pe oricare uşă (din cele $N$) este mai mare sau egal cu 10 şi mai mic sau egal cu $32800$;
* pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei a) se acordă 20% din punctaj, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a ambelor cerinţe se acordă 100% din punctaj.

The bug in the previous solution was in the logic for checking if a door can be opened with the given key. The logic was incorrect because it was checking if the final result of the complementing process was equal to the key, but it should have checked if the final result was equal to the key and the initial number was a magic number.

Here is the fixed solution:
```python
with open('alice.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    doors = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

max_even = 0
doors_to_open = 0
for door in doors:
    if door % 2 == 0 and door > max_even:
        max_even = door
    
    num = door
    is_magic = True
    while num > 9:
        max_digit = 0
        while num > 0:
            digit = num % 10
