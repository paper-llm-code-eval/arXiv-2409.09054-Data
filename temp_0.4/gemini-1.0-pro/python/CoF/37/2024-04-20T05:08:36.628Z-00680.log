Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `blis.in` and write to `blis.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un şir de biţi şi un număr natural `K`. Şirul se împarte în secvenţe astfel încât fiecare bit din şir să aparţină unei singure secvenţe şi fiecare secvenţă să aibă lungimea cel puţin `1` şi cel mult `K`. După împărţire, fiecare secvenţă de biţi se converteşte în baza `10`, obţinându-se un şir de valori zecimale. De exemplu, pentru şirul de biţi `1001110111101010011` şi `K = 4`, se poate obţine `1 0011 101 111 0 1010 011`, apoi în baza `10`: `1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 10, 3`. O altă împărţire poate fi `1 00 1 1 10 11 110 1010 011`, adică `1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 3`.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care:
* determină valoarea maximă (în baza `10`) care se poate obţine dintr-o secvenţă de cel mult `K` biţi
* împarte şirul iniţial în secvenţe de cel mult `K` biţi astfel încât şirul zecimal obţinut să conţină un subşir strict crescător de lungime maximă posibilă.

# Date de intrare
Prima linie a fişierului de intrare `blis.in` conţine numărul natural `K`, iar pe linia a doua se află şirul de biţi, şirul neconţinând spaţii.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `blis.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând valoarea maximă care se poate obţine dintr-o secvenţă de cel mult `K` biţi, iar pe linia a doua un singur număr natural reprezentând lungimea maximă a subşirului strict crescător care se poate obţine din şirul de biţi prin împărţirea sa în secvenţe de cel mult `K` biţi.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* `3 ≤ lungimea şirului de biţi ≤ 100 000`
* pentru `70%` din teste, `lungimea şirului de biţi ≤ 1000`
* `1 ≤ K ≤ 30`
* Un subşir se obţine dintr-un şir prin eliminarea a zero, unul, două sau mai multe elemente;
* O secvenţă este formată din elemente aflate pe poziţii consecutive în şir;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerinţe se acordă `20%` din punctaj, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de-a doua se acordă `80%`.

The error is caused by the fact that when `j` is equal to `i`, the slice `bits[i - j:i]` becomes an empty string, which is not a valid binary number. To fix this, we can add a check to make sure that `j` is not equal to `i` before trying to convert the slice to an integer.

---------- assistant ----------

The error is caused by the same issue as before: when `j` is equal to `i`, the slice `bits[i - j:i]` becomes an empty string, which is not a valid binary number.

To fix this, we can add a check to make sure that `j` is not equal to `i` before trying to convert the slice to an integer.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def max_value(bits, k):
    """
    Calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from a sequence of at most k bits.

    Args:
        bits (str): The string of bits.
        k (int): The maximum length of a sequence.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum value that can be obtained.
    """
    n = len(bits)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], int(bits[i - 1], 2))

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(k, i) + 1):
            if j != i:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + int(bits[i - j:i], 2))

    return dp[n]


def max_increasing_subsequence(bits, k):
    """
    Divides the string of bits into sequences of at most k bits such that the resulting decimal string contains the longest possible strictly increasing subsequence.

    Args:
        bits (str): The string of bits.

        int: The length of the longest possible strictly increasing subsequence.
