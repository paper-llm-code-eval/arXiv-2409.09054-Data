Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `rj.in` and write to `rj.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

În ultima ecranizare a celebrei piese shakespeariene Romeo şi Julieta trăiesc într-un oraş modern, comunică prin e-mail şi chiar învaţă să programeze. Într-o secvenţă tulburătoare sunt prezentate frământările interioare ale celor doi eroi încercând fără succes să scrie un program care să determine un punct optim de întâlnire. 

Ei au analizat harta oraşului şi au reprezentat-o sub forma unei matrice cu $n$ linii şi $m$ coloane, în matrice fiind marcate cu spaţiu zonele prin care se poate trece (străzi lipsite de pericole) şi cu `X` zonele prin care nu se poate trece. De asemenea, în matrice au marcat cu `R` locul în care se află locuinţa lui Romeo, iar cu `J` locul în care se află locuinţa Julietei. 

Ei se pot deplasa numai prin zonele care sunt marcate cu spaţiu, din poziţia curentă în oricare dintre cele 8 poziţii învecinate (pe orizontală, verticală sau diagonale).

Cum lui Romeo nu îi place să aştepte şi nici să se lase aşteptat n-ar fi tocmai bine, ei au hotărât că trebuie să aleagă un punct de întâlnire în care atât Romeo, cât şi Julieta să poată ajunge în acelaşi timp, plecând de acasă. Fiindcă la întâlniri amândoi vin într-un suflet, ei estimează timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la întâlnire prin numărul de elemente din matrice care constituie drumul cel mai scurt de acasă până la punctul de întâlnire. Şi cum probabil există mai multe puncte de întâlnire posibile, ei vor să îl aleagă pe cel în care timpul necesar pentru a ajunge la punctul de întâlnire este minim.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine o poziţie pe hartă la care Romeo şi Julieta pot să ajungă în acelaşi timp. Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul trebuie să determine o soluţie pentru care timpul este minim.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `rj.in` conţine:
* pe prima linie numerele naturale `N M`, care reprezintă numărul de linii şi respectiv de coloane ale matricei, separate prin spaţiu;
* pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se află $M$ caractere (care pot fi doar `R`, `J`, `X` sau spaţiu) reprezentând matricea.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `rj.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care sunt scrise trei numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu `tmin x y`, având semnificaţia:
* `x y` reprezinţă punctul de întâlnire ($x$ – numărul liniei, $y$ – numărul coloanei);
* `tmin` este timpul minim în care Romeo (respectiv Julieta) ajunge la punctul de întâlnire.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N, M \leq 100$;
* Liniile şi coloanele matricei sunt numerotate începând cu 1.
* Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie.

Example:
`rj.in`
```
5 8
XXR  XXX
 X  X  X
J X X  X
      XX
XXX XXXX
```

`rj.out`
```
4 4 4

The error message:
```
IndexError: list index out of range
```
indicates that the program is trying to access an element of a list that does not exist. In this case, the error is occurring on line 9 of the program, where the program is trying to access the element `grid[i][j]`. However, the list `grid` only has `n` elements, and the program is trying to access the element at index `i`, which is greater than or equal to `n`.

To fix the error, we need to make sure that the program does not try to access elements of the list `grid` that do not exist. One way to do this is to check the value of `i` before trying to access the element `grid[i][j]`. For example, we can add the following code to the beginning of line 9:
```python
if i < n:
```
This code will check if the value of `i` is less than `n`, and if it is not, the program will skip the rest of the line.

Here is the fixed code:

The error message:
```
IndexError: list index out of range
```
indicates that the program is trying to access an element of a list that does not exist. In this case, the error is occurring on line 9 of the program, where the program is trying to access the element `grid[i][j]`. However, the list `grid` only has `n` elements, and the program is trying to access the element at index `i`, which is greater than or equal to `n`.

To fix the error, we need to make sure that the program does not try to access elements of the list `grid` that do not exist. One way to do this is to check the value of `i` and `j` before trying to access the element `grid[i][j]`. For example, we can add the following code to the beginning of line 9:
```python
if i < n and j < m:
```
This code will check if the value of `i` and `j` is less than `n` and `m`, and if it is not, the program will skip the rest of the line.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
from queue import Queue

with open("rj.in", "r") as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(f.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if i < n and j < m and grid[i][j] == 'R':
                rx, ry = i, j
            elif i < n and j < m and grid[i][j] == 'J':
                jx, jy = i, j

    def bfs(sx, sy):
        q = Queue()
        q.put((sx, sy, 0))
        dist = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        dist[sx][sy] = 0

        while not q.empty():
            x, y, d = q.get()
            for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and grid[nx][ny] != 'X' and dist[nx][ny] > d + 1:
                    dist[nx][ny] = d + 1
                    q.put((nx, ny, d + 1))

        return dist

    dist_r = bfs(rx, ry)
    dist_j = bfs(jx, jy)

    min_time = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] != 'X':
                min_time = min(min_time, dist_r[i][j] + dist_j[i][j])

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] != 'X' and dist_r[i][j] + dist_j[i][j] == min_time:
                print(i + 1, j + 1, min_time)
                exit()
```
