Afișarea cu ajutorul led-urilor este un fapt banal astăzi. Pe lângă consumul redus, oferă și o imagine spectaculoasă, atractivă. Fiind informaticieni în devenire, este util pentru noi să avem la dispoziție un **ceas binar**. Un astfel de ceas are 8 coloane de leduri. Fiecărei cifre din afișarea orei îi corespunde o coloană verticală cu maxim $4$ leduri. Fiecare cifră a orei este reprezentată în binar, iar coloana corespunzătoare de leduri vizualizează această reprezentare, poziția binară $0$ a reprezentării fiind la baza coloanei. Astfel, orei `10:35:42.68` îi va corespunde configurația:

~[ceas.png|align=center]

Este evident faptul că prima coloană are nevoie doar de $2$ leduri, deoarece această coloană vizualizează doar valorile $0, 1$ și $2$. În mod analog, coloanele $3$ și $5$ au nevoie doar de $3$ leduri, deoarece valorile care trebuie vizualizate sunt $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. În celelate coloane vor fi vizualizate și valorile $7, 8$ și $9$, deci sunt necesare câte $4$ leduri.

# Cerință

Fiind dată configurația ceasului binar la un moment dat și o perioadă de timp exprimată în sutimi de secundă, să se determine și să se afișeze configurația ceasului după trecerea perioadei respective de timp.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ceas.in` conține $5$ linii. Primele $4$ linii conțin configurația inițială a ceasului, iar linia a $5$-a perioada de timp $t$. Pentru configurația ceasului se folosesc caracterele ` `$\ $(spațiu), `x` și `o`. Caracterul ` `$\ $reprezintă poziția unui led care lipsește, caracterul `x` poziția unui led stins iar caracterul `o` poziția unui led aprins.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ceas.out` conține pe primele $4$ linii configurația finală a ceasului în modul descris mai sus, utilizând aceleași caractere ` `, `x`, `o`. Cele $4$ linii încep din coloana $1$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;

Example:
`ceas.in`
```
 x x xxo
 xxooxox
xxoxxoox
oxooxxxx
123
```

`ceas.out`
```
 x x xox
 xxooxxx
xxoxxoxx
oxooxooo

The error is caused by the fact that the last line of the input file is empty. This causes the `int()` function to fail when trying to convert the empty string to an integer.

To fix the issue, we can add a check to see if the last line of the input file is empty, and if it is, we can set `t` to 0.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('ceas.in') as fin, open('ceas.out', 'w') as fout:
    leds = [list(l.strip()) for l in fin.readlines()[:4]]
    t = int(fin.readline()) if fin.readline() else 0
    for i in range(8):
        l = leds[i]
        for j in range(len(l)):
            if l[j] == 'o':
                t -= 2**j
                l[j] = ' '
                if t < 0:
                    break
        if t < 0:
            break
    for l in leds:
        fout.write(''.join(l) + '\n')

The difference between the expected and found results is that the found result does not correctly update the LEDs after the time `t` has passed. Specifically, the LED in the first column, second row should be turned off, but it remains on in the found result.

The reason for this is that the code does not correctly handle the case where `t` is less than 0. When `t` is less than 0, the code should stop updating the LEDs and break out of the loop. However, the code currently only breaks out of the loop if `t` is less than 0 after updating the current LED. This means that the code will always update at least one LED after `t` becomes negative, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to see if `t` is less than 0 before updating the current LED. If `t` is less than 0, we can break out of the loop immediately without updating the current LED.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('ceas.in') as fin, open('ceas.out', 'w') as fout:
    leds = [list(l.strip()) for l in fin.readlines()[:4]]
    t = int(fin.readline()) if fin.readline() else 0
    for i in range(8):
        l = leds[i]
        for j in range(len(l)):
            if t < 0:
                break
            if l[j] == 'o':
                t -= 2**j
                l[j] = ' '
        if t < 0:
            break
    for l in leds:
        fout.write(''.join(l) + '\n')

The error is caused by the fact that the input file does not have 4 lines of data for the LED configuration. This causes the `leds` list to be empty, and when the code tries to access `leds[i]`, it raises an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to see if the `leds` list is empty. If it is empty, we can print an error message and exit the program.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
with open('ceas.in') as fin, open('ceas.out', 'w') as fout:
    leds = [list(l.strip()) for l in fin.readlines()[:4]]
    if not leds:
        print("Error: Input file does not have 4 lines of data for the LED configuration.")
