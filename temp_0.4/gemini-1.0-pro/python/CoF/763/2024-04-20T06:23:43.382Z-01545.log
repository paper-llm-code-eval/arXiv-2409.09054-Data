Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `furnica.in` and write to `furnica.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Pe o tablă de șah cu $n$ linii și $n$ coloane se află firimituri de pâine și o furnică. Pentru fiecare pătrățel, inclusiv cel în care se găsește furnica, aflat pe linia $i$ și coloana $j$, cantitatea de firimituri de pâine este egală cu restul împărțirii lui $i + j$ la $6$. Astfel pentru $n = 4$ tabla de șah conține următoarele cantități de firimituri:

|2|3|4|5|
-|-|-|-
|**3**|**4**|**5**|**0**|
|**4**|**5**|**0**|**1**|
|**5**|**0**|**1**|**2**|

Furnica (notată cu `F` în figura de mai jos) se poate deplasa din pătrățelul unde se găsește în toate cele opt pătrățele vecine, numerotate ca mai jos:

|8|1|2|
-|-|-
|**7**|**F**|**3**|
|**6**|**5**|**4**|

Furnica se deplasează, pornind din pătrățica aflată în colțul din stânga sus, în una dintre pătrățelele vecine, și așa mai departe. Pe drumul său furnica se hrănește cu toată cantitatea de firimituri din pătrățelele prin care a trecut (după ce iese din pătrățică catitatea de firimituri devine $0$). Drumul furnicii este dat printr-un șir de $k$ numere naturale (cuprinse între $1$ și $8$) care precizează, la fiecare pas, următorul pătrățel din drum.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru un drum dat determină cantitatea totală de firimituri mâncată de furnică, precum și numărul pătrățelelor prin care aceasta a trecut de cele mai multe ori.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `furnica.in` conține pe prima linie numerele $n$ și $k$, separate între ele printr-un spațiu, iar pe linia următoare $k$ numere naturale ($1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$ sau $8$) separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând următorul pătrățel din drum pentru un pătrățel curent.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `furnica.out` va conține, pe prima linie, cantitatea totală și numărul pătrățelelor din cerință separate printr-un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 101$;
* $0 < k < 201$;
* Drumul furnicii nu iese din tablou.

Example:
`furnica.in`
```
4 10
3 6 5 3 2 6 3 6 2 3
```

`furnica.out`

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

---------- assistant ----------

The program exited with code 1 because the `ant_row` or `ant_col` went out of bounds. This can happen if the furnica's path leads it outside of the board. To fix this, we need to add bounds checking to the program.

Here is the fixed program:
```python
with open("furnica.in", "r") as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    path = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]

board = [[(i + j) % 6 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
visited = [[0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
max_count = 0
max_count_squares = []

ant_row, ant_col = 0, 0
total_crumbs = 0

for direction in path:
    if direction == 1:
        ant_row -= 1
        ant_col -= 1
    elif direction == 2:
        ant_row -= 1
    elif direction == 3:
        ant_row -= 1
        ant_col += 1
    elif direction == 4:
        ant_col -= 1
    elif direction == 6:
        ant_col += 1
    elif direction == 7:
        ant_row += 1
        ant_col -= 1
    elif direction == 8:
        ant_row += 1

    # Check if the ant is still on the board
    if ant_row < 0 or ant_row >= n or ant_col < 0 or ant_col >= n:
        break

    visited[ant_row][ant_col] += 1
    if visited[ant_row][ant_col] > max_count:
        max_count = visited[ant_row][ant_col]
        max_count_squares = [(ant_row, ant_col)]
    elif visited[ant_row][ant_col] == max_count:
        max_count_squares.append((ant_row, ant_col))

    total_crumbs += board[ant_row][ant_col]
    board[ant_row][ant_col] = 0

with open("furnica.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"{total_crumbs} {max_count}\n")

The reason why the results differ is that the program does not correctly handle the case where the ant exits the board. In the example input, the ant exits the board after the fourth move. The fixed program should check if the ant is still on the board after each move, and if not, it should stop iterating over the path.

    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    path = [int(x) for x in f.readline().split()]
