Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `flori.in` and write to `flori.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Fetiţele din grupa mare de la grădiniţă culeg flori şi vor să împletească coroniţe pentru festivitatea de premiere. În grădină sunt mai multe tipuri de flori. Fiecare dintre cele $n$ fetiţe culege un buchet având acelaşi număr de flori, însă nu neapărat de acelaşi tip. Pentru a împleti coroniţele fetiţele se împart în grupe. O fetiţă se poate ataşa unui grup numai dacă are cel puţin o floare de acelaşi tip cu cel puţin o altă fetiţă din grupul respectiv.

# Cerinţă
Fiind dat un număr natural $n$ reprezentând numărul fetiţelor şi numărul natural $k$ reprezentând numărul de flori dintr-un buchet, să se determine grupele care se formează.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `flori.in` conţine pe prima linie, separate printr-un spaţiu, numerele naturale $n$ şi $k$, reprezentând numărul de fetiţe şi respectiv numărul de flori din fiecare buchet. Fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii conţine, pentru fiecare fetiţă, câte $k$ valori separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând tipurile de flori culese.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `flori.out` va conţine pe fiecare linie câte o grupă formată din numerele de ordine ale fetiţelor separate prin câte un spaţiu, în ordine crescătoare, ca în exemplu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $1 \leq n \leq 150$
- $1 \leq k \leq 100$
- Tipul unei flori este un număr întreg din intervalul $[0, 100]$.
- Într-o grupă numerele de ordine ale fetiţelor trebuie date în ordine strict crescătoare.
- În fişierul de ieşire grupele vor fi afişate în ordinea crescătoare a numărului de ordine al primei fetiţe din grupă.

Example:
`flori.in`
```
5 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 9 6
1 1 1 1
2 4 4 3
7 7 7 7
```

`flori.out`
```
1 3 4
2
5
```

The error is caused by the fact that the graph may not contain all the flower types that appear in the input. This can happen if a girl does not have any flowers in common with any other girl. To fix this, we need to add all the flower types to the graph before performing DFS.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import sys

with open('flori.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
    flowers = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Create a graph where each node represents a flower type and each edge represents a common flower type between two girls
graph = {}
for flower_type in set([item for sublist in flowers for item in sublist]):
    graph[flower_type] = set()

for i in range(n):
    for flower in flowers[i]:
        graph[flower].add(i)

# Find connected components in the graph using DFS
def dfs(node, visited, component):
    if node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    component.append(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(neighbor, visited, component)

visited = set()
components = []
for flower in graph:
    if flower not in visited:

        dfs(flower, visited, component)

# Write the components to the output file
