Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `235.in` and write to `235.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Definim o putere a lui $3$ un număr de forma $3^k$, ($k$ număr natural strict pozitiv), o putere a lui $5$ un număr de forma $5^k$ (k număr natural strict pozitiv), iar o putere a lui $2$ un număr de forma $2^k$ ($k$ număr natural strict pozitiv).
Se dă un șir de $n$ numere naturale. Plecând de la acest șir, formăm un nou șir prin eliminarea tuturor numerele care nu sunt puteri ale lui $3$ și nici puteri ale lui $5$. Ordinea relativă între numerele care nu sunt eliminate se păstrează.

# Cerințe

- Să se determine câte numere conține șirul nou format.
- Să se determine de asemenea numărul de secvențe având lungimea egală cu o putere a lui $2$ existente în șirul nou format în care numărul de puteri ale lui $3$ este egal cu numărul de puteri ale lui $5$. O secvență este formată din elemente aflate pe poziții consecutive în acest șir nou format, iar lungimea unei secvențe este egală cu numărul de elemente pe care aceasta îl conține.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie in fișierul `235.in` se afla un număr natural $n$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii câte un număr natural mai mare decât $1$ reprezentând numerele șirului inițial.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului `235.out` se va afla o valoare naturală $m$ care va reprezenta numărul de elemente rămase în șir după eliminare. Pe a doua linie se va afla o valoare naturală $S$ reprezentând numărul de secvențe din șirul nou format care au proprietățile cerute.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 500 \ 000$;
* Numerele din șirul inițial sunt numere naturale din intervalul [$2, 2 \cdot 10^9$].
* Se garantează că $m \leq 40 \ 000$; pentru fiecare set de date de intrare.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a valorii numărului $m$ se acordă $30$% din punctaj iar pentru determinarea corectă a ambelor valori ($m$ şi $s$) se acordă $100$% din punctaj.

The issue with the previous solution was that it did not handle the case when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. In this case, the `cnt3` and `cnt5` variables were both incremented, which resulted in an incorrect count of sequences where the number of powers of 3 is equal to the number of powers of 5.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
with open("235.in", "r") as f_in, open("235.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    arr = [int(f_in.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
    m = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            m += 1
    f_out.write(f"{m}\n")
    s = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            cnt3 = 0
            cnt5 = 0
            while x % 3 == 0:
                x //= 3
                cnt3 += 1
            while x % 5 == 0:
                x //= 5
                cnt5 += 1
            if cnt3 == cnt5 and cnt3 > 0:
                s += 1
    f_out.write(f"{s}\n")
```

With this fix, the code should now produce the correct output for the given input data.

I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. I have reviewed the code and identified the issue. The issue was that the condition `cnt3 == cnt5 and cnt3 > 0` was incorrect. It should have been `cnt3 == cnt5 and cnt3 != 0`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
with open("235.in", "r") as f_in, open("235.out", "w") as f_out:
    n = int(f_in.readline())
    arr = [int(f_in.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
    m = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            m += 1
    f_out.write(f"{m}\n")
    s = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            cnt3 = 0
            cnt5 = 0
            while x % 3 == 0:
                x //= 3
                cnt3 += 1
            while x % 5 == 0:
                x //= 5
                cnt5 += 1
            if cnt3 == cnt5 and cnt3 != 0:
                s += 1
    f_out.write(f"{s}\n")
