Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `lacusta.in` and write to `lacusta.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

Example:
`lacusta.in`
```
4 5
3 4 5 7 9
6 6 3 4 4
6 3 3 9 6
6 5 3 8 2
```

`lacusta.out`
```
28

I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Here is a correct solution in Python:

```python
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        if i > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + grid[i][j])
        if j > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j])

with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(dp[m - 1][n - 1]))
```

The previous solution was incorrect because it did not correctly handle the case where the current cell can be reached from both the cell above and the cell to the left. In this case, the minimum cost to reach the current cell is the minimum of the costs to reach the cell above and the cell to the left, plus the cost of the current cell.

The corrected solution uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost to reach each cell in the grid. The dp array is initialized with infinity for all cells except the top-left cell, which is initialized with the value of the top-left cell in the grid. Then, for each cell in the grid, the minimum cost to reach that cell is computed as the minimum of the costs to reach the cell above and the cell to the left, plus the cost of the current cell. Finally, the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell is written to the output file.
