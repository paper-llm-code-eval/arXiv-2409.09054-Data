Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `lacusta.in` and write to `lacusta.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

The mistake in the previous solution was that it was not taking into account the fact that the last move is a jump and not a jump and a step. This meant that the last row was being double-counted.

Here is the corrected solution:
```python
with open("lacusta.in", "r") as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
dp[0][0] = mat[0][0]

for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + mat[i][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + mat[i][j]

# Fix: Do not double-count the last row
dp[m - 1][n - 1] -= mat[m - 1][n - 1]

with open("lacusta.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(dp[m - 1][n - 1]))

I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. I have reviewed the code and the logic and found the mistake.

The mistake was in the line:
```python
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + mat[i][j]
```

This line should have been:
```python
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + mat[i][j]
```

The reason for this is that at each cell, we have three options:

1. Come from the cell above (i.e. `dp[i - 1][j]`)
2. Come from the cell to the left (i.e. `dp[i][j - 1]`)
3. Come from the cell diagonally above and to the left (i.e. `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`)

We need to consider all three of these options to find the minimum cost path to the current cell.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
with open("lacusta.in", "r") as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
dp[0][0] = mat[0][0]

for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + mat[i][j]
        elif j == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + mat[i][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + mat[i][j]

with open("lacusta.out", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(dp[m - 1][n - 1]))

I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. I have reviewed the code and the logic again and found the mistake.

The mistake was in the initialization of the `dp` array. I had initialized it with `0`s, but the first row and first column should be initialized with the values from the input matrix.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
with open("lacusta.in", "r") as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
for i in range(m):
    dp[i][0] = mat[i][0]
for j in range(n):
    dp[0][j] = mat[0][j]

for i in range(1, m):
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + mat[i][j]

We need to consider all three of these options to find the minimum cost path to the current cell. However, we also need to subtract 1 from the cost of the current cell because we are only allowed to take one step down at a time.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
with open("lacusta.in", "r") as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    mat = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
for i in range(m):
    dp[i][0] = mat[i][0]
for j in range(n):
