Împăratul cel bătrân vrea să împartă sacii cu galbeni din vistieria palatului celor $K$ feciori ai săi, numerotați de la $1$ la $K$ în ordinea vârstei. Feciorul cu numărul $1$ este cel mai mare, iar mezinul are numărul $K$.

În vistierie sunt $N$ saci plini cu galbeni, așezați în linie, atât de grei încât nu li se poate schimba ordinea, iar pe fiecare sac este scris numărul de galbeni pe care îi conține.
\
Împăratul îl cheamă pe unul dintre feciori și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_1$ saci!”. Feciorul ia sacii și pleacă fericit. Apoi, împăratul cheamă alt fecior și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_2$ saci dintre cei rămași!”. Și așa mai departe, până ajunge la ultimul fecior chemat, căruia îi dă toți sacii rămași.

El nu are o ordine anume în care își cheamă feciorii dar are grijă să cheme fiecare fecior exact o dată. Totodată, pentru a evita certurile între ei, este atent ca fiecare fecior să primească cel puțin un sac cu galbeni, dar **să NU primească în total mai mulți galbeni ca un frate mai mare decât el**. Cel mai mic dintre feciorii împăratului este și cel mai viteaz, așa că împăratul ar vrea să îi dea lui o sumă de bani cât mai mare, fără a-i supăra pe ceilalți feciori ai săi.

# Cerință
Cum ar putea împărți împăratul sacii?

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mostenire.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $K$, separate de un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural, reprezentând numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac, în ordinea în care aceștia urmează să fie distribuiți fiilor.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `mostenire.out` va conține pe prima linie suma de galbeni pe care o va primi fiul cel mic de la împărat. Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al feciorului, respectiv numărul de saci $x_i$ pe care îi primește acesta, în ordinea în care au fost chemați de împărat.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq K \leq 100$
- $K \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac va fi între $1$ și $100\ 000$.
- Galbenii din oricare dintre saci nu pot fi împărțiți mai multor frați.
- Numărul total de galbeni aflați în vistierie este mai mic sau egal cu $10^9$.
- Împăratul cel bătrân nu are doi feciori cu aceeași vârstă.
- **Puteți afișa orice soluție în care mezinul primește numărul maxim posibil de galbeni**.
- Pentru fiecare test, afișarea corectă a numărului maxim de galbeni primiți de mezin este notată cu $40\%$ din punctajul alocat testului.
- Pentru teste valorând 10 puncte, $N = K$ și $N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste valorând 30 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 15$.
- Pentru teste valorând 50 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 100$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to ensure that each son receives at least one sack, and that no younger son receives more gold than an older son. The goal is to maximize the amount of gold the youngest son receives.

The approach can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of sacks `N` and the number of sons `K`. Then read the number of gold coins in each sack.
2. **Binary Search for Maximum Gold**: Use binary search to determine the maximum possible gold the youngest son can receive. For each candidate value in the binary search, check if it's feasible to distribute the sacks such that the youngest son gets at least that amount without violating the constraints.
3. **Feasibility Check**: For each candidate value in the binary search, simulate the distribution of sacks to check if it's possible to give the youngest son at least that amount of gold.
4. **Output the Result**: Once the maximum possible gold for the youngest son is determined, output the result along with the distribution of sacks.

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

bool canDistribute(const vector<int>& sacks, int K, int minGold) {
    int currentSum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int gold : sacks) {
        currentSum += gold;
        if (currentSum >= minGold) {
            count++;
            currentSum = 0;
        }
        if (count >= K) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("mostenire.in");
    ofstream fout("mostenire.out");

    int N, K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    vector<int> sacks(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> sacks[i];
    }

    int left = 1, right = accumulate(sacks.begin(), sacks.end(), 0) / K;
    int best = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (canDistribute(sacks, K, mid)) {
            best = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    fout << best << "\n";

    vector<int> distribution(K, 0);
    vector<int> numSacks(K, 0);
    int currentSum = 0;
    int currentIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        currentSum += sacks[i];
        numSacks[currentIndex]++;
        if (currentSum >= best && currentIndex < K - 1) {
            distribution[currentIndex] = currentSum;
            currentSum = 0;
            currentIndex++;
        }
    }
    distribution[currentIndex] = currentSum;

    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
        fout << (i + 1) << " " << numSacks[i] << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the values of `N` and `K` and then the number of gold coins in each sack.
2. **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search on the possible maximum amount of gold the youngest son can receive. The search space is between `1` and the total sum of gold divided by `K`.
3. **Feasibility Check**: The `canDistribute` function checks if it is possible to distribute the sacks such that each son receives at least the candidate amount of gold.
4. **Output**: Once the maximum possible gold for the youngest son is found, we output this value and the distribution of sacks.

This solution ensures that the youngest son receives the maximum possible amount of gold while maintaining the constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output in the program is due to the order in which the sons are assigned the sacks. The expected output specifies a particular order of distribution, while the found output follows the order in which the sons are processed.

To address this, we need to ensure that the distribution order matches the expected format. Specifically, we need to ensure that the sons are processed in the correct sequence and that the total gold distribution respects the constraints.

We will use a different approach to ensure the correct distribution order and respect the constraints. Here is the revised solution:

```cpp

#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to check if it's possible to distribute the sacks such that the youngest son gets at least minGold

        if (currentSum >= minGold) {
            distribution[count] = i - lastIndex + 1;
            lastIndex = i + 1;
            currentSum = 0;
            count++;
        }
        if (count == K - 1) {
            distribution[count] = sacks.size() - lastIndex;
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("mostenire.in");
    ofstream fout("mostenire.out");

    int N, K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    vector<int> sacks(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> sacks[i];
    }

    int left = 1, right = accumulate(sacks.begin(), sacks.end(), 0) / K;
    int best = 0;
    vector<int> bestDistribution(K);

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        vector<int> distribution(K);
        if (canDistribute(sacks, K, mid, distribution)) {
            best = mid;
            bestDistribution = distribution;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    fout << best << "\n";
    int currentIndex = 0;

    }

    return 0;

1. Ensure that the youngest son receives the maximum possible amount of gold.
2. Ensure that the distribution respects the constraints that each son receives at least one sack and no younger son receives more gold than an older son.
3. Ensure that the distribution order is correct.

Let's reimplement the solution using a different approach. We will use a greedy algorithm combined with binary search to ensure the correct distribution order and respect the constraints.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

// Function to check if it's possible to distribute the sacks such that the youngest son gets at least minGold
bool canDistribute(const vector<int>& sacks, int K, int minGold, vector<int>& distribution) {
    int currentSum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    int lastIndex = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < sacks.size(); ++i) {
        currentSum += sacks[i];
        if (currentSum >= minGold) {
            distribution[count] = i - lastIndex + 1;
            lastIndex = i + 1;
            currentSum = 0;
            count++;
        }
        if (count == K - 1) {
            distribution[count] = sacks.size() - lastIndex;
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("mostenire.in");
    ofstream fout("mostenire.out");

    int N, K;
    fin >> N >> K;
    vector<int> sacks(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> sacks[i];
    }

    int left = 1, right = accumulate(sacks.begin(), sacks.end(), 0) / K;
    int best = 0;
    vector<int> bestDistribution(K);

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        vector<int> distribution(K);
        if (canDistribute(sacks, K, mid, distribution)) {
            best = mid;
            bestDistribution = distribution;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    fout << best << "\n";
    int currentIndex = 0;
    for (int i = K - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        fout << (i + 1) << " " << bestDistribution[i] << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the values of `N` and `K` and then the number of gold coins in each sack.
2. **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search on the possible maximum amount of gold the youngest son can receive. The search space is between `1` and the total sum of gold divided by `K`.
3. **Feasibility Check**: The `canDistribute` function checks if it is possible to distribute the sacks such that each son receives at least the candidate amount of gold. The function also fills the `distribution` vector with the number of sacks each son receives.
4. **Output**: Once the maximum possible gold for the youngest son is found, we output this value and the distribution of sacks in the correct order.

This solution ensures that the youngest son receives the maximum possible amount of gold while maintaining the constraints and respecting the correct order of distribution.

The previous implementations did not correctly handle the constraints and order of distribution. Specifically, they did not ensure that the youngest son receives the maximum possible amount of gold while maintaining the correct order of distribution and ensuring that no younger son receives more gold than an older son.

1. Ensure that the youngest son receives the maximum possible amount of gold.
