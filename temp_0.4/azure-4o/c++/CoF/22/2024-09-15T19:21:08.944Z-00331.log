Se dă un arbore cu $N$ noduri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$.

Arborele se va transforma astfel: la oricare etapă fiecare nod de gradul $1$ diferit de rădăcină din arborele actual se înlocuiește cu un arbore identic cu cel dat inițial, iar la următoarea etapă procedeul se va relua pentru arborele obținut, formându-se astfel un arbore infinit. În următoarele $3$ imagini se prezintă un exemplu de arbore dat inițial, arborele obținut după prima etapă de prelungire a frunzelor și arborele obținut după $2$ etape de prelungire a frunzelor.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the problem efficiently, we need to understand the infinite tree structure and how it extends. The challenge is to count the number of nodes at a given distance \( D \) from the root in this infinite tree.

### Approach

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - We will use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
   - We will read the input from the file `tairos.in`.

2. **Initial Distance Calculation**:
   - Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the root (node 1) to calculate the distance of each node from the root in the initial tree.

3. **Infinite Tree Simulation**:
   - Nodes that are leaves (degree 1 except the root) will be replaced by the entire initial tree in each extension step.
   - We need to count nodes at distance \( D \) considering these infinite extensions.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result can be very large, we will use modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \) as specified.

### Implementation

Here is the C++ code implementing the above approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000000007;

void bfs(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& adj, std::vector<int>& dist, int root) {
    std::queue<int> q;
    q.push(root);
    dist[root] = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (dist[neighbor] == -1) {
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("tairos.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("tairos.out");

    int N, D;
    infile >> N >> D;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> adj(N + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        adj[x].push_back(y);
        adj[y].push_back(x);
    }

    std::vector<int> dist(N + 1, -1);
    bfs(adj, dist, 1);

    std::vector<int> count(N, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (dist[i] != -1 && dist[i] < N) {
            count[dist[i]]++;
        }
    }

    long long result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= D; ++i) {
        if (i < N) {
            result = (result + count[i]) % MOD;
        } else {
            result = (result * (N - 1)) % MOD;
        }
    }

    outfile << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the number of nodes \( N \) and the distance \( D \).
   - We construct the adjacency list for the tree.

2. **BFS for Initial Distances**:
   - We perform BFS from the root (node 1) to calculate the distance of each node from the root.

3. **Counting Nodes**:
   - We count the number of nodes at each distance in the initial tree.
   - For distances greater than or equal to \( N \), we account for the infinite extensions by multiplying the count of nodes at distance \( N-1 \) by \( (N-1) \) for each additional distance step.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - We output the result modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.

To address the discrepancy between the expected and found results, let's re-evaluate the problem and the approach. The issue likely arises from the incorrect handling of the infinite tree extension process. Specifically, we need to ensure that we correctly simulate the infinite extension of the tree and count the nodes at the given distance \( D \).

### Problem Re-evaluation
The infinite tree is formed by extending each leaf node (except the root) with a copy of the initial tree. This process continues indefinitely. The challenge is to count the number of nodes at a specific distance \( D \) from the root.

### Correct Approach
1. **Tree Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the initial tree.
   - Read the input from `tairos.in`.

2. **Initial Distance Calculation**:
   - Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the root to calculate the distance of each node from the root in the initial tree.

3. **Infinite Tree Simulation**:
   - Use dynamic programming to simulate the infinite extension of the tree and count the nodes at distance \( D \).

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Use modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \) to handle large numbers.

   - Construct the adjacency list for the tree.

2. **BFS for Initial Distances**:
   - Perform BFS from the root (node 1) to calculate the distance of each node from the root.

3. **Identifying Leaf Nodes**:
   - Identify leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1 except the root) and record their distances from the root.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Infinite Tree**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[d]` represents the number of nodes at distance \( d \) in the infinite tree.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 (the root node).
   - For each distance \( d \) from 1 to \( D \), update `dp[d]` by considering the contribution of each leaf node.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Output the result modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \).

This approach ensures that we correctly simulate the infinite extension of the tree and count the nodes at the given distance \( D \).

To address the discrepancy between the expected and found results, let's re-evaluate the problem and the approach. The issue likely arises from the incorrect handling of the infinite tree extension process. Specifically, we need to ensure that we correctly simulate the infinite extension of the tree and count the nodes at the given distance \( D \).

### Problem Re-evaluation
The infinite tree is formed by extending each leaf node (except the root) with a copy of the initial tree. This process continues indefinitely. The challenge is to count the number of nodes at a specific distance \( D \) from the root.

### Correct Approach
1. **Tree Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the initial tree.
   - Read the input from `tairos.in`.

2. **Initial Distance Calculation**:
   - Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the root to calculate the distance of each node from the root in the initial tree.

3. **Infinite Tree Simulation**:
   - Use dynamic programming to simulate the infinite extension of the tree and count the nodes at distance \( D \).

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Use modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \) to handle large numbers.

    }

            leaf_distances.push_back(dist[i]);
        }
    }

    std::vector<long long> dp(D + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int d = 1; d <= D; ++d) {
        for (int leaf_dist : leaf_distances) {
            if (d >= leaf_dist + 1) {
                dp[d] = (dp[d] + dp[d - leaf_dist - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << dp[D] << std::endl;
