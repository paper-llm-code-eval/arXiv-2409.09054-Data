Se dă un arbore cu $N$ noduri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$.

Arborele se va transforma astfel: la oricare etapă fiecare nod de gradul $1$ diferit de rădăcină din arborele actual se înlocuiește cu un arbore identic cu cel dat inițial, iar la următoarea etapă procedeul se va relua pentru arborele obținut, formându-se astfel un arbore infinit. În următoarele $3$ imagini se prezintă un exemplu de arbore dat inițial, arborele obținut după prima etapă de prelungire a frunzelor și arborele obținut după $2$ etape de prelungire a frunzelor.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to simulate the infinite expansion of the tree and count the nodes at a specific distance \( D \) from the root. Given the constraints, we can use a combination of tree traversal and dynamic programming.

### Approach

1. **Tree Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Initial Distance Calculation**: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the root to calculate the initial distances of all nodes from the root.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Expansion**: Use dynamic programming to simulate the infinite expansion of the tree. We'll keep track of the number of nodes at each distance using a DP array.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result needs to be modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \), we will ensure all our calculations respect this constraint.

### Steps

1. **Read Input**: Read the input from `tairos.in`.
2. **Tree Construction**: Construct the tree using an adjacency list.
3. **Initial BFS**: Calculate the distances of nodes from the root using BFS.
4. **DP Array Initialization**: Initialize a DP array to keep track of the number of nodes at each distance.
5. **DP Transition**: Simulate the expansion of the tree using the DP array.
6. **Output the Result**: Write the result to `tairos.out`.

Here's the C++ implementation of the above approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1000000007;

void bfs(const vector<vector<int>>& tree, vector<int>& dist) {
    int n = tree.size();
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(1);
    dist[1] = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (dist[neighbor] == -1) {
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("tairos.in");
    ofstream fout("tairos.out");

    int N, D;
    fin >> N >> D;

    vector<vector<int>> tree(N + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        fin >> x >> y;
        tree[x].push_back(y);
        tree[y].push_back(x);
    }

    vector<int> dist(N + 1, -1);
    bfs(tree, dist);

    vector<int> dp(D + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1; // Only the root is at distance 0

    for (int d = 0; d < D; ++d) {
        vector<int> new_dp(D + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            if (dist[i] != -1 && d + dist[i] <= D) {
                new_dp[d + dist[i]] = (new_dp[d + dist[i]] + dp[d]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        dp = new_dp;
    }

    fout << dp[D] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Tree Construction**: We read the input and construct the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **BFS for Initial Distances**: We perform a BFS starting from the root (node 1) to calculate the initial distances of all nodes from the root.
3. **DP Array Initialization**: We initialize a DP array where `dp[d]` represents the number of nodes at distance `d` from the root in the infinite tree.
4. **DP Transition**: We iterate over the distances and update the DP array to simulate the expansion of the tree. For each node and each distance, we update the DP array accordingly.
5. **Output the Result**: Finally, we write the result to `tairos.out`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the nodes at distance \( D \) while handling the constraints effectively.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and identify the issues in the initial solution.

### Analysis

The initial solution incorrectly calculates the number of nodes at a given distance \( D \) by simply expanding the tree using dynamic programming. The issue lies in the way the tree expansion is simulated. The expansion should consider the structure of the tree and how new subtrees are added at each step.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Initial Distance Calculation**: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the root to calculate the initial distances of all nodes from the root.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Expansion**: Use dynamic programming to simulate the infinite expansion of the tree. We'll keep track of the number of nodes at each distance using a DP array.

### Explanation

1. **Tree Construction**: We read the input and construct the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **BFS for Initial Distances**: We perform a BFS starting from the root (node 1) to calculate the initial distances of all nodes from the root.
3. **Leaf Distance Calculation**: We identify all leaf nodes and store their distances from the root.
4. **DP Array Initialization**: We initialize a DP array where `dp[d]` represents the number of nodes at distance `d` from the root in the infinite tree.
5. **DP Transition**: We iterate over the distances and update the DP array to simulate the expansion of the tree. For each node and each distance, we update the DP array accordingly.
6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we write the result to `tairos.out`.

This approach ensures that we correctly count the nodes at distance \( D \) while handling the constraints effectively.

Thank you for your patience. Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the issues in the previous solution.

### Analysis

The problem requires us to simulate the infinite expansion of the tree and count the nodes at a specific distance \( D \) from the root. The previous solution had issues in correctly simulating this expansion.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Initial Distance Calculation**: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the root to calculate the initial distances of all nodes from the root.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Expansion**: Use dynamic programming to simulate the infinite expansion of the tree. We'll keep track of the number of nodes at each distance using a DP array.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result needs to be modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \), we will ensure all our calculations respect this constraint.

### Steps

1. **Read Input**: Read the input from `tairos.in`.
2. **Tree Construction**: Construct the tree using an adjacency list.
3. **Initial BFS**: Calculate the distances of nodes from the root using BFS.
4. **DP Array Initialization**: Initialize a DP array to keep track of the number of nodes at each distance.
5. **DP Transition**: Simulate the expansion of the tree using the DP array.
6. **Output the Result**: Write the result to `tairos.out`.
