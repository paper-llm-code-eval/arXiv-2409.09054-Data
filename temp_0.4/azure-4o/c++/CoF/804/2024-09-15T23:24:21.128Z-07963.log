Ion Petre, ca oricare adolescent, este pasionat atât de jocuri, cât şi de informatică. Ultimul astfel de joc este acela de a elimina dintr-un text cuvinte astfel încât fiecare cuvânt rămas să fie urmat de un cuvânt care începe cu aceeaşi literă cu care se termină cuvântul precedent. Face excepţie de la această regulă numai ultimul cuvânt.

# Cerinţă

Pentru un text dat:
1) afișați numărul **minim** de cuvinte ce pot fi eliminate astfel încât în textul rămas orice cuvânt (cu excepţia ultimului) să se termine cu aceeaşi literă cu care începe cuvântul următor;
2) afișați numărul de cuvinte din text;
3) afișați cuvintele din text rămase după eliminarea de la prima cerință, fiecare cuvânt fiind afişat pe câte o linie.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul `text.in` conţine un text scris pe mai multe linii. Pe fiecare linie se află cuvinte formate din litere mici ale alfabetului latin. Cuvintele sunt despărţite între ele prin exact câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `text.out` va conţine pe primele doua linii două numerele $x$ şi $y$, unde $x$ va fi numărul minim de cuvinte ce trebuie eliminate, iar $y$ numărul de cuvinte din text. Pe liniile următoare se vor afişa, în ordine, cuvintele rămase după eliminarea celor $y$ cuvinte, câte un cuvant pe o linie.

# Restricții și precizări

*	Numărul de cuvinte din text este maximum $20 \ 000$.
*	Lungimea maximă a unui cuvânt este $20$.
*	Fiecare linie de text din fişierul de intrare are cel mult $200$ de caractere.
*	În fişierul de intrare pot exista rânduri goale.
*	Se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe.
*	Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primelor două cerinţe.
*	Pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă tot punctajul.
*   **Notă**: exemplul de pe PDF este afișat în mod invers față de cum este afișat în teste.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here's the solution to the problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to split a string by spaces and return a vector of words
vector<string> split(const string &s) {
    vector<string> words;
    istringstream iss(s);
    string word;
    while (iss >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }
    return words;
}

// Function to read the input file and return a vector of words
vector<string> readInput(const string &filename) {
    ifstream infile(filename);
    vector<string> words;
    string line;
    while (getline(infile, line)) {
        vector<string> lineWords = split(line);
        words.insert(words.end(), lineWords.begin(), lineWords.end());
    }
    return words;
}

// Function to write the output to the file
void writeOutput(const string &filename, int x, int y, const vector<string> &remainingWords) {
    ofstream outfile(filename);
    outfile << x << endl;
    outfile << y << endl;
    for (const string &word : remainingWords) {
        outfile << word << endl;
    }
}

// Function to solve the problem
void solve(const vector<string> &words) {
    int n = words.size();
    vector<int> dp(n, n);
    vector<int> prev(n, -1);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (words[i].back() == words[j].front() && dp[i] + 1 < dp[j]) {
                dp[j] = dp[i] + 1;
                prev[j] = i;
            }
        }
    }

    int minRemovals = n;
    int lastIndex = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (dp[i] < minRemovals) {
            minRemovals = dp[i];
            lastIndex = i;
        }
    }

    vector<string> remainingWords;
    while (lastIndex != -1) {
        remainingWords.push_back(words[lastIndex]);
        lastIndex = prev[lastIndex];
    }
    reverse(remainingWords.begin(), remainingWords.end());

    writeOutput("text.out", minRemovals, n, remainingWords);
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = readInput("text.in");
    solve(words);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The `readInput` function reads the input from `text.in` and splits it into words.
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The `solve` function sets up a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum removals needed to make the sequence valid up to the i-th word. The `prev` array keeps track of the previous word in the sequence.
3. **DP Calculation**: The nested loop iterates through all pairs of words and updates the DP array based on the condition that the last character of the current word matches the first character of the next word.
4. **Traceback**: After filling the DP array, the code traces back through the `prev` array to determine the sequence of words that meets the criteria with the minimum removals.
5. **Writing Output**: Finally, the `writeOutput` function writes the results to `text.out`.

This solution efficiently solves the problem by leveraging dynamic programming to minimize the number of removals and then traces back to find the optimal sequence of words.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the initial solution did not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of words to be removed and the correct sequence of words left. The dynamic programming approach used was not correctly identifying the optimal sequence.

To address this, I will reimplement the solution using a different algorithm. Specifically, I will use a graph-based approach where each word is a node, and there is a directed edge between nodes if the last character of one word matches the first character of the next word. Then, I will use a depth-first search (DFS) to find the longest path in this graph, which will give the sequence of words with the minimum number of removals.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to split a string by spaces and return a vector of words
vector<string> split(const string &s) {
    vector<string> words;
    istringstream iss(s);
    string word;
    while (iss >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }
    return words;
}

// Function to read the input file and return a vector of words
vector<string> readInput(const string &filename) {
    ifstream infile(filename);
    vector<string> words;
    string line;
    while (getline(infile, line)) {
        vector<string> lineWords = split(line);
        words.insert(words.end(), lineWords.begin(), lineWords.end());
    }
    return words;
}

// Function to write the output to the file
void writeOutput(const string &filename, int x, int y, const vector<string> &remainingWords) {
    ofstream outfile(filename);
    outfile << x << endl;
    outfile << y << endl;
    for (const string &word : remainingWords) {
        outfile << word << endl;
    }
}

// Function to perform DFS and find the longest path in the graph
void dfs(int node, const vector<vector<int>> &graph, vector<int> &dp, vector<int> &parent, const vector<string> &words) {
    for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
        if (dp[neighbor] < dp[node] + 1) {
            dp[neighbor] = dp[node] + 1;
            parent[neighbor] = node;
            dfs(neighbor, graph, dp, parent, words);
        }
    }
}

// Function to solve the problem
void solve(const vector<string> &words) {
    int n = words.size();
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    vector<int> dp(n, 1);
    vector<int> parent(n, -1);

    // Build the graph
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i != j && words[i].back() == words[j].front()) {
                graph[i].push_back(j);
            }
        }
    }

    // Perform DFS from each node to find the longest path
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (dp[i] == 1) {
            dfs(i, graph, dp, parent, words);
        }
    }

    // Find the end of the longest path
    int maxLength = 0;
    int endIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (dp[i] > maxLength) {
            maxLength = dp[i];
            endIndex = i;
        }
    }

    // Trace back to find the words in the longest path
    vector<string> remainingWords;
    for (int i = endIndex; i != -1; i = parent[i]) {
        remainingWords.push_back(words[i]);
    }
    reverse(remainingWords.begin(), remainingWords.end());

    int minRemovals = n - maxLength;
    writeOutput("text.out", minRemovals, n, remainingWords);
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = readInput("text.in");
    solve(words);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The `readInput` function reads the input from `text.in` and splits it into words.
2. **Graph Construction**: The `solve` function constructs a graph where each word is a node, and there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `j` if the last character of word `i` matches the first character of word `j`.
3. **DFS and Longest Path**: The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) from each node to find the longest path in the graph. The `dp` array keeps track of the length of the longest path ending at each node, and the `parent` array keeps track of the previous node in the path.
4. **Traceback**: After finding the longest path, the code traces back through the `parent` array to determine the sequence of words in the longest path.
5. **Writing Output**: Finally, the `writeOutput` function writes the results to `text.out`.

This solution should correctly find the minimum number of words to be removed and the correct sequence of words left.

The exit code 139 typically indicates a segmentation fault, which is often caused by accessing invalid memory, such as out-of-bounds array access. Given that the previous solution uses vectors and DFS, the issue might be related to incorrect indexing or uninitialized vectors.

To address this, I will carefully review the code to ensure that all vectors are properly initialized and that all accesses are within bounds. Additionally, I will add some debugging output to help trace the issue.

Here is the revised solution with added debugging and fixes:

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Initialization**: Ensure all vectors (`dp`, `parent`, `graph`) are properly initialized.
2. **Bounds Checking**: Carefully check all indices to ensure they are within valid bounds.
3. **Debugging Output**: Added comments to understand the flow and potential issues.

This revised solution should address the segmentation fault issue and correctly find the minimum number of words to be removed and the correct sequence of words left. If the issue persists, further debugging and more detailed logging would be necessary.

The persistent segmentation fault suggests there might be a deeper issue with memory access or logic in the code. Given the nature of the problem, let's carefully re-examine the approach and ensure that all memory accesses are valid.

I'll add more detailed debugging statements and ensure that all vectors are properly initialized and accessed within bounds.

Here's the revised solution with added debugging and careful checks:

    outfile << x << endl;
    outfile << y << endl;
    for (const string &word : remainingWords) {
