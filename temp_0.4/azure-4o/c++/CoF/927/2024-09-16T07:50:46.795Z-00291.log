Se consideră modelul unui sistem solar format din $N$ planete care se rotesc în jurul unei stele $S$, în sens trigonometric. Traiectoriile planetelor se consideră circulare și de raze diferite, iar vitezele de rotație ale planetelor în jurul stelei sunt numere naturale și sunt exprimate în grade pe zi ($\degree$/zi).

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de planete $N$ și vitezele lor de rotație $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, precum și două numere naturale $P$ și $Z$, să se determine numărul $A$ de alinieri a câte minimum $P$ planete, pe o dreaptă ce trece prin centrul stelei $S$, după trecerea celor $Z$ zile. Evoluția sistemului solar începe cu toate planetele așezate orizontal, în dreapta stelei $S$.
\
Spre exemplu, pentru $N=4$, $P=3$, $Z=365$ și $V = [20, 11, 8, 6]$, alinierea a minimum $3$ planete din cele $4$ se va face la finalul zilelor $60$, $90$, $120$, $180$, $240$, $270$, $300$, $360$. După $365$ de zile vor exista $A=8$ alinieri. În imaginea din dreapta se observă poziția planetelor la prima aliniere.
~[1.jpg|align=center|width=55em]

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `alinieri.in` conține pe prima linie, în această ordine, numerele naturale $N$, $P$ și $Z$, iar pe a doua linie, $N$ numere naturale $V_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$ cu semnificația de mai sus. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `alinieri.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul $A$, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq P \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Z \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq V_i \leq 10^3$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq Z \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $1 \leq N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 30 de puncte, $2 \leq P \leq 9$.
- Se vor lua în considerare doar alinierile de la sfârșitul fiecărei zile (ora 24:00), când planetele și-au încheiat parcursul zilnic.

```

This C++ code reads the input from `alinieri.in`, processes the data to determine the number of alignments of at least `P` planets after `Z` days, and writes the result to `alinieri.out`. The solution uses a hash map to count the occurrences of each angle at the end of each day and checks for alignments with at least `P` planets. This approach ensures efficient processing even for large input sizes.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to the way the alignments are being counted. The initial solution counts the number of alignments on each individual day, but it doesn't account for the fact that multiple alignments can occur over the span of the given days.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the periodic nature of the rotations and how often the planets align over the given number of days. We need to check for alignments at the end of each day and count how many times at least `P` planets align.

Here's the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    infile >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> V(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> V[i];
    }

    // To store the number of alignments
    int alignments = 0;

    // A map to count the occurrences of each angle
    std::unordered_map<int, int> angle_count;

    // Iterate through each day
    for (int day = 1; day <= Z; ++day) {
        angle_count.clear();
        
        // Calculate the angle for each planet at the end of the day
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int angle = (V[i] * day) % 360;
            angle_count[angle]++;
        }

        // Count the number of alignments
        for (const auto& entry : angle_count) {
            if (entry.second >= P) {
                alignments++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    outfile << alignments << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix

1. **Reading Input Correctly**: The input is read correctly from the file `alinieri.in`.
2. **Tracking Angles**: For each day, we calculate the angle at which each planet is located using `(V[i] * day) % 360`.
3. **Counting Alignments**: We use an unordered map to count the occurrences of each angle. If the count of any angle is greater than or equal to `P`, it indicates an alignment.
4. **Summing Alignments**: We sum up the alignments for each day.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the number of alignments to zero and create an unordered map to count the occurrences of each angle.
2. **Iterate Through Days**: For each day from 1 to `Z`, we clear the angle count map and compute the angle for each planet.
3. **Count Alignments**: For each angle, if the count is greater than or equal to `P`, we increase the alignment count.
4. **Output the Result**: Finally, we write the number of alignments to `alinieri.out`.

This approach ensures that we correctly count the number of alignments over the given number of days, taking into account the periodic nature of the rotations.

The discrepancy arises because the solution is counting alignments for each day independently, but it does not account for the fact that alignments can occur at specific intervals and repeat over time. This means that the solution needs to consider the periodicity of the planets' rotations and identify the days when alignments happen.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation periods to determine the periodicity of the alignments.
2. Track the alignments over the given number of days by checking the angles of the planets.

Here is the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <numeric>

// Function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD)
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int t = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = t;
    }
    return a;
}

// Function to compute the least common multiple (LCM)
int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return a / gcd(a, b) * b;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    infile >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> V(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> V[i];
    }

    // Calculate the LCM of all rotation periods
    int rotation_period = V[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        rotation_period = lcm(rotation_period, V[i]);
    }

    // To store the number of alignments
    int alignments = 0;

    // A map to count the occurrences of each angle
    std::unordered_map<int, int> angle_count;

    // Iterate through each day up to the LCM period
    for (int day = 1; day <= rotation_period; ++day) {
        angle_count.clear();

        // Calculate the angle for each planet at the end of the day
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int angle = (V[i] * day) % 360;
            angle_count[angle]++;
        }

        // Count the number of alignments
        for (const auto& entry : angle_count) {
            if (entry.second >= P) {
                alignments++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the total number of alignments over Z days
    int total_alignments = (Z / rotation_period) * alignments;

    // Check the remaining days after the last complete period
    int remaining_days = Z % rotation_period;
    for (int day = 1; day <= remaining_days; ++day) {
        angle_count.clear();

        // Calculate the angle for each planet at the end of the day
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int angle = (V[i] * day) % 360;
            angle_count[angle]++;
        }

        // Count the number of alignments
        for (const auto& entry : angle_count) {
            if (entry.second >= P) {
                total_alignments++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    outfile << total_alignments << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix

1. **Calculate LCM**: We calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all the rotation periods to determine the periodicity of the alignments.
2. **Track Alignments Over LCM Period**: We track the alignments for each day up to the LCM period.
3. **Calculate Total Alignments**: We calculate the total number of alignments over `Z` days by multiplying the number of alignments in one LCM period by the number of complete LCM periods in `Z` days and then adding the alignments for the remaining days.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the number of alignments to zero and create an unordered map to count the occurrences of each angle.
2. **Calculate LCM**: We calculate the LCM of the rotation periods to determine the periodicity of the alignments.
3. **Track Alignments Over LCM Period**: For each day from 1 to the LCM period, we clear the angle count map and compute the angle for each planet.

5. **Calculate Total Alignments**: We calculate the total number of alignments over `Z` days by considering the number of complete LCM periods and the remaining days.
6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we write the number of alignments to `alinieri.out`.

This approach ensures that we correctly count the number of alignments over the given number of days, taking into account the periodic nature of the rotations.

The discrepancy in the results suggests that the current approach is still not correctly capturing the alignments. The key issue is that we need to accurately track when alignments occur and ensure we are counting all possible alignments over the given number of days.

### Explanation of the Fix

1. **Calculate LCM**: We calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all the rotation periods to determine the periodicity of the alignments.
2. **Track Alignments Over LCM Period**: We track the alignments for each day up to the LCM period.
3. **Calculate Total Alignments**: We calculate the total number of alignments over `Z` days by multiplying the number of alignments in one LCM period by the number of complete LCM periods in `Z` days and then adding the alignments for the remaining days.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the number of alignments to zero and create an unordered map to count the occurrences of each angle.
2. **Calculate LCM**: We calculate the LCM of the rotation periods to determine the periodicity of the alignments.
3. **Track Alignments Over LCM Period**: For each day from 1 to the LCM period, we clear the angle count map and compute the angle for each planet.
4. **Count Alignments**: For each angle, if the count is greater than or equal to `P`, we increase the alignment count.
5. **Calculate Total Alignments**: We calculate the total number of alignments over `Z` days by considering the number of complete LCM periods and the remaining days.
6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we write the number of alignments to `alinieri.out`.

This approach ensures that we correctly count the number of alignments over the given number of days, taking into account the periodic nature of the rotations.

The discrepancy in the results indicates that the current approach is not correctly capturing the alignments. The issue is likely due to the way we are counting alignments each day independently without considering the periodic nature of the rotations.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Track the positions of the planets over time.
2. Identify when alignments occur by checking if at least `P` planets are at the same angle.
3. Count these alignments over the given number of days.

Here is the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

#include <algorithm>

// Function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD)
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int t = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = t;
    }
    return a;
}

// Function to compute the least common multiple (LCM)
int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return a / gcd(a, b) * b;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("alinieri.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("alinieri.out");

    int N, P, Z;
    infile >> N >> P >> Z;

    std::vector<int> V(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> V[i];
    }

    // Calculate the LCM of all rotation periods
    int rotation_period = V[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        rotation_period = lcm(rotation_period, V[i]);
    }

    // To store the number of alignments
    int alignments = 0;

    // A map to count the occurrences of each angle
    std::unordered_map<int, int> angle_count;

    // Iterate through each day up to the LCM period
    for (int day = 1; day <= rotation_period; ++day) {
        angle_count.clear();

        // Calculate the angle for each planet at the end of the day
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int angle = (V[i] * day) % 360;

        }

        // Count the number of alignments
        for (const auto& entry : angle_count) {
            if (entry.second >= P) {
                alignments++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the total number of alignments over Z days
    int total_alignments = (Z / rotation_period) * alignments;

    // Check the remaining days after the last complete period
    int remaining_days = Z % rotation_period;
    for (int day = 1; day <= remaining_days; ++day) {
        angle_count.clear();

        // Calculate the angle for each planet at the end of the day
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int angle = (V[i] * day) % 360;
            angle_count[angle]++;
        }

        // Count the number of alignments
        for (const auto& entry : angle_count) {
            if (entry.second >= P) {
                total_alignments++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    outfile << total_alignments << std::endl;

    return 0;
