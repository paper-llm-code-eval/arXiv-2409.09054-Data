Un elev în clasa a V-a, Rareş, s-a gândit să studieze mersul trenurilor ce trec prin gara din oraşul său, într-o zi. Gara are $2$ linii, numerotate cu $1$ şi $2$, pe care sosesc şi pleacă trenurile. În acea zi, în gară sosesc $T$ trenuri. Pentru fiecare tren din cele $T$, Rareş cunoaşte linia $L$ pe care va sosi, momentul sosirii, adică ora $H$ şi minutul $M$, precum şi durata de timp $S$ de staţionare (exprimată în minute). El a decis ca perioada de studiu a celor $T$ trenuri să înceapă cu momentul sosirii primului tren în gară din cele $T$ şi să se încheie odată cu momentul plecării ultimului tren din cele $T$.

Din sala de aşteptare Rareş poate vedea cele $2$ linii. Rareş are însă o problemă: atunci când un tren se află în gară pe linia $1$, el nu poate vedea trenul staţionat în acelaşi timp pe linia $2$. De exemplu, dacă un tren ajunge în gară pe linia $1$ la ora $14:21$ şi staţionează $5$ minute atunci trenul va pleca din gară la ora $14:26$. Astfel, în intervalul de timp [$14:21-14:26$], Rareş nu poate vedea ce se întâmplă pe linia $2$. Trenul de pe linia $2$ va putea fi vizibil începând cu minutul următor, adică de la $14:27$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine pentru un număr $T$ de trenuri care trec prin gară în perioada de studiu din acea zi:

* numărul maxim de trenuri $Z$ care au staţionat pe aceeaşi linie;
* numărul $X$ de trenuri pe care Rareş le vede;
* durata de timp maximă $Y$ (exprimată în număr de minute consecutive), din perioada de studiu, în care Rareş nu a văzut niciun tren.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `tren.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $T$ de trenuri şi pe fiecare din următoarele $T$ linii, în ordinea sosirii trenurilor în gară, câte patru numere naturale $L$, $H$, $M$ şi $S$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, ce reprezintă linia $L$ pe care soseşte trenul, momentul sosirii trenului (ora $H$ şi minutul $M$) şi durata de timp $S$ de staţionare.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `tren.out` conţine pe prima linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu, valorile cerute $Z$, $X$ și $Y$ (în această ordine).

# Restricții și precizări


* $2 \leq T \leq 100$; $0 \leq H \leq 23$; $0 \leq M \leq 59$; $1 \leq S \leq 9$;
* în acelaşi moment de timp nu pot pleca/sosi mai multe trenuri;
* în acelaşi moment de timp nu poate pleca un tren şi altul să sosească;
* pe aceeaşi linie nu pot staţiona mai multe trenuri în acelaşi moment de timp;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $Z$ se acordă 20% din punctajul pe test;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $X$ se acordă 40% din punctajul pe test;
* pentru aflarea corectă a numărului $Y$ se acordă 40% din punctajul pe test.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of trains `T` and then the details of each train.
   - Each train's arrival time is converted to minutes since midnight for easier calculations.

2. **Sorting Trains:**
   - The trains are sorted based on their arrival times to process them in chronological order.

3. **Calculating Z:**
   - We keep track of the maximum number of trains that have been on each line (`max_trains_line1` and `max_trains_line2`).

4. **Calculating X and Y:**
   - We keep track of the last departure times for both lines.
   - We count the number of trains Rareș can see (`X`) and calculate the maximum period he cannot see any train (`max_no_view_time`).

5. **Output:**
   - The results are written to the output file `tren.out`.

This solution efficiently processes the train data and calculates the required values with a time complexity of O(T log T) due to sorting, which is efficient given the constraints.

Let's analyze the discrepancies between the expected and found results:

1. **Number of Trains Rareș Can See (X):**
   - The expected value is 5, but the found value is 4. This indicates that our logic for determining visibility might be flawed.

2. **Maximum Period Rareș Cannot See Any Train (Y):**
   - The expected value is 11, but the found value is 27. This suggests that our calculation for the no-view period is incorrect.

To address these issues, we need to carefully re-evaluate the logic for determining when Rareș can see trains and the periods during which he cannot see any trains.

### Key Observations:
1. Rareș can only see a train on one line if there is no train on the other line during that period.
2. We need to accurately track the periods during which Rareș cannot see any trains and ensure that we correctly account for the overlap and gaps between train schedules.

### Revised Plan:
1. Parse the input and store the train data.
2. Sort trains based on their arrival times.
3. Use two separate lists to track the periods during which each line is occupied.
4. Determine the maximum number of trains on any single line.
5. Calculate the number of trains Rareș can see by checking for overlaps.
6. Calculate the maximum period Rareș cannot see any train by merging the occupied periods and finding the gaps.

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Visibility Calculation (X):**
   - Ensured that we correctly count trains that Rareș can see by checking for overlaps.
   - Adjusted the logic to accurately track the last departure times for both lines.

2. **No-View Period Calculation (Y):**
   - Corrected the logic to merge occupied periods and find the gaps accurately.
   - Ensured that we correctly calculate the maximum period Rareș cannot see any train.

This revised solution should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output.

The discrepancies between the expected and found results indicate that the logic for counting the number of trains Rareș can see (`X`) and calculating the maximum period he cannot see any train (`Y`) is flawed. Specifically, the issues are:

1. **Visibility Calculation (X):**
   - The current logic incorrectly counts the number of visible trains by not properly handling the overlap between trains on different lines.

2. **No-View Period Calculation (Y):**
   - The logic for calculating the no-view period does not correctly account for the gaps between the departure times of trains on different lines.

To fix these issues, we need a more robust approach to track the visibility and no-view periods. We can use a timeline approach to simulate the events (arrivals and departures) and determine the visibility and no-view periods accurately.

### Revised Plan:
1. Parse the input and store the train data.
2. Sort trains based on their arrival times.
3. Use a timeline to track events (arrivals and departures) on both lines.
4. Determine the maximum number of trains on any single line.
5. Calculate the number of trains Rareș can see by checking for overlaps using a timeline.
6. Calculate the maximum period Rareș cannot see any train by finding the gaps in the timeline.

The discrepancies between the expected and found results indicate that the logic for counting the number of trains Rareș can see (`X`) is flawed. Specifically, the found value of `X` is 8, whereas the expected value is 5. This suggests that our logic for determining visibility is overcounting the number of trains Rareș can see.

### Key Observations:
1. **Visibility Calculation (X):**
   - Rareș can only see a train on one line if there is no train on the other line during that period.
   - The logic needs to correctly handle the overlap between trains on different lines.

2. **No-View Period Calculation (Y):**
   - The logic for calculating the no-view period seems to be correct, as the found value matches the expected value.

To fix these issues, we need to carefully re-evaluate the logic for determining when Rareș can see trains and ensure that we correctly account for the overlap and gaps between train schedules.

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Visibility Calculation (X):**
   - Used a timeline approach to track the events on both lines.
   - Correctly counted the number of visible trains by checking for overlaps and updating the last event time.

2. **No-View Period Calculation (Y):**
   - Used the timeline to find the gaps between the events and calculate the maximum no-view period accurately.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the logic for counting the number of trains Rareș can see (`X`) is flawed. Specifically, the found value of `X` is 8, whereas the expected value is 5. This suggests that our logic for determining visibility is overcounting the number of trains Rareș can see.

### Key Observations:
1. **Visibility Calculation (X):**
   - Rareș can only see a train on one line if there is no train on the other line during that period.
   - The logic needs to correctly handle the overlap between trains on different lines.

2. **No-View Period Calculation (Y):**
   - The logic for calculating the no-view period seems to be correct, as the found value matches the expected value.

To fix these issues, we need to carefully re-evaluate the logic for determining when Rareș can see trains and ensure that we correctly account for the overlap and gaps between train schedules.

### Revised Plan:
1. Parse the input and store the train data.
2. Sort trains based on their arrival times.
3. Use two separate lists to track the periods during which each line is occupied.
4. Determine the maximum number of trains on any single line.
5. Calculate the number of trains Rareș can see by checking for overlaps.
6. Calculate the maximum period Rareș cannot see any train by merging the occupied periods and finding the gaps.
