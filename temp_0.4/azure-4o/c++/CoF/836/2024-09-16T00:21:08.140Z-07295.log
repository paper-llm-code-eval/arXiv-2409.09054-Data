Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 200 \ 000$;
* Elementele șirului sunt numere naturale și au cel mult $6$ cifre
* Se acordă 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea corectă a celei mai mari puteri a unui element din șir și 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea numărului de elemente din şir care au cea mai mare putere.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this challenge efficiently, we need to determine the "power" of each element in the array. The power of an element is defined by the number of non-empty subarrays in which the element is the maximum. 

To achieve this, we can use a combination of a stack-based approach and dynamic programming to keep track of the number of subarrays where each element is the maximum. This approach ensures that we can compute the result in linear time, which is crucial given the constraint \( N \leq 200,000 \).

Here is the C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("maxp.in");
    ofstream outfile("maxp.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;
    vector<int> a(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> a[i];
    }

    vector<long long> power(N, 0);

    stack<int> s;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] < a[i]) {
            int idx = s.top();
            s.pop();
            int left = s.empty() ? -1 : s.top();
            power[idx] += (long long)(idx - left) * (i - idx);
        }
        s.push(i);
    }

    while (!s.empty()) {
        int idx = s.top();
        s.pop();
        int left = s.empty() ? -1 : s.top();
        power[idx] += (long long)(idx - left) * (N - idx);
    }

    long long max_power = *max_element(power.begin(), power.end());
    int count_max_power = count(power.begin(), power.end(), max_power);

    outfile << max_power << "\n" << count_max_power << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the input from the file `maxp.in` and store the elements in a vector `a`.

2. **Initialize Power Vector**: We initialize a vector `power` of size `N` to store the power of each element.

3. **Stack-Based Approach**: We use a stack to keep track of the indices of elements in the array. The stack helps in identifying the ranges where each element is the maximum.

4. **First Pass (Left to Right)**:
    - For each element, we pop elements from the stack while the current element is greater than the element at the index stored at the top of the stack.
    - For each popped element, we calculate the number of subarrays where it is the maximum by considering the distance to the left and right bounds.
    - Push the current index onto the stack.

5. **Second Pass (Remaining Elements)**:
    - After the first pass, some elements might still be in the stack. These elements are the maximum in subarrays that extend to the end of the array.
    - We process these remaining elements similarly to the first pass.

6. **Determine Maximum Power and Count**:
    - We find the maximum value in the `power` vector.
    - We count how many times this maximum value appears in the `power` vector.

7. **Write Output**: Finally, we write the results to `maxp.out`.

This solution ensures that each element is processed in constant time relative to its position, leading to an overall linear time complexity, \( O(N) \), which is optimal for the given constraints.

Upon reviewing the problem and the provided solution, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the logic for calculating the power of each element. Specifically, the stack-based approach did not correctly account for the subarrays where each element is the maximum.

To fix this, let's take a different approach. We need to calculate the power of each element by considering all subarrays where the element is the maximum. This can be done by determining the contribution of each element to the subarrays in which it is the maximum.

Here's an improved version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("maxp.in");
    ofstream outfile("maxp.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;
    vector<int> a(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> a[i];
    }

    vector<long long> power(N, 0);

    // Calculate the number of subarrays where each element is the maximum
    stack<int> s;
    vector<int> left(N, -1), right(N, N);

    // Find the previous greater element for each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] < a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        if (!s.empty()) {
            left[i] = s.top();
        }
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Clear the stack for reuse
    while (!s.empty()) s.pop();

    // Find the next greater element for each element
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] <= a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        if (!s.empty()) {
            right[i] = s.top();
        }
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Calculate the power of each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        power[i] = (long long)(i - left[i]) * (right[i] - i);
    }

    // Find the maximum power and count the number of elements with that power
    long long max_power = *max_element(power.begin(), power.end());
    int count_max_power = count(power.begin(), power.end(), max_power);

    outfile << max_power << "\n" << count_max_power << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

1. **Reading Input**: We read the input from the file `maxp.in` and store the elements in a vector `a`.

2. **Initialize Power Vector**: We initialize a vector `power` of size `N` to store the power of each element.

    - We use a stack to find the previous greater element for each element in the array.
    - The `left` vector stores the index of the previous greater element for each element.

4. **Next Greater Element**:
    - We reuse the stack to find the next greater element for each element in the array.
    - The `right` vector stores the index of the next greater element for each element.

5. **Calculate Power**:
    - For each element, the power is calculated as the product of the distances to the previous and next greater elements.
    - This gives the number of subarrays where the element is the maximum.

6. **Determine Maximum Power and Count**:
    - We find the maximum value in the `power` vector.
    - We count how many times this maximum value appears in the `power` vector.

7. **Write Output**: Finally, we write the results to `maxp.out`.

3. **Calculate Power**: For each element, the power is determined by the product of the number of subarrays to the left and right where the element is the maximum.

### Implementation

Let's implement this logic correctly:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("maxp.in");
    ofstream outfile("maxp.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;
    vector<int> a(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> a[i];
    }

    vector<long long> power(N, 0);

    // Calculate the number of subarrays where each element is the maximum
    stack<int> s;
    vector<int> left(N, -1), right(N, N);

    // Find the previous greater element for each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] <= a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        if (!s.empty()) {
            left[i] = s.top();
        }
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Clear the stack for reuse
    while (!s.empty()) s.pop();

    // Find the next greater element for each element
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] < a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        if (!s.empty()) {
            right[i] = s.top();
        }
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Calculate the power of each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        long long left_count = (i - left[i]);
        long long right_count = (right[i] - i);
        power[i] = left_count * right_count;
    }

    // Find the maximum power and count the number of elements with that power
    long long max_power = *max_element(power.begin(), power.end());
    int count_max_power = count(power.begin(), power.end(), max_power);

    outfile << max_power << "\n" << count_max_power << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the input from the file `maxp.in` and store the elements in a vector `a`.

2. **Initialize Power Vector**: We initialize a vector `power` of size `N` to store the power of each element.

3. **Previous Greater Element**:
    - We use a stack to find the previous greater element for each element in the array.
    - The `left` vector stores the index of the previous greater element for each element.

4. **Next Greater Element**:
    - We reuse the stack to find the next greater element for each element in the array.
    - The `right` vector stores the index of the next greater element for each element.

5. **Calculate Power**:
    - For each element, the power is calculated as the product of the number of subarrays to the left and right where the element is the maximum.
    - This gives the number of subarrays where the element is the maximum.

6. **Determine Maximum Power and Count**:
    - We find the maximum value in the `power` vector.
    - We count how many times this maximum value appears in the `power` vector.

7. **Write Output**: Finally, we write the results to `maxp.out`.

This solution ensures that each element is processed efficiently, leading to an overall linear time complexity, \( O(N) \), which is optimal for the given constraints.

I apologize for the previous mistakes. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and ensure we correctly implement the logic to find the power of each element.

### Problem Analysis

The power of an element \(a_i\) is defined as the number of non-empty subarrays in which \(a_i\) is the maximum element. To efficiently compute this, we need to consider all subarrays where \(a_i\) is the maximum and count them correctly.

### Correct Approach

1. **Previous Greater Element**: For each element, find the nearest previous element that is greater.
2. **Next Greater Element**: For each element, find the nearest next element that is greater.
3. **Calculate Power**: For each element, the power is determined by the product of the number of subarrays to the left and right where the element is the maximum.

    ofstream outfile("maxp.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;
    vector<int> a(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> a[i];
    }

    vector<long long> power(N, 0);

    // Calculate the number of subarrays where each element is the maximum
    stack<int> s;
    vector<int> left(N, -1), right(N, N);

    // Find the previous greater element for each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] <= a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        if (!s.empty()) {
            left[i] = s.top();
        }
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Clear the stack for reuse
    while (!s.empty()) s.pop();

    // Find the next greater element for each element
    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        while (!s.empty() && a[s.top()] < a[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        if (!s.empty()) {
            right[i] = s.top();
        }
        s.push(i);
    }

    // Calculate the power of each element
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        long long left_count = (i - left[i]);
        long long right_count = (right[i] - i);
        power[i] = left_count * right_count;
    }

    // Find the maximum power and count the number of elements with that power
    long long max_power = *max_element(power.begin(), power.end());
    int count_max_power = count(power.begin(), power.end(), max_power);

    outfile << max_power << "\n" << count_max_power << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```
