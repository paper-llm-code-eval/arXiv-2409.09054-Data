Un tort dreptunghiular de dimensiuni $M \cdot N$ trebuie împărţit în porţii pătrate de aceeaşi mărime.

# Cerință

Găsiţi numărul minim de porţii care se pot obţine şi dimensiunea $L$ a acestora. Atât dimensiunile dreptunghiului cât şi ale pătratelor în care se împarte sunt numere întregi.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `tort.in` va conţine pe prima linie numerele $M$ şi $N$ separate printr-un spaţiu. 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `tort.out` va conţine pe o singură linie, două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu, primul fiind numărul minim de porţii, iar celălalt dimensiunea $L$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq M, N \leq 10 \ 000$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this challenge efficiently, we need to determine the largest possible square size \( L \) that can divide both dimensions \( M \) and \( N \) of the rectangular cake. This can be achieved by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( M \) and \( N \). The number of such squares will then be the area of the rectangle divided by the area of one square.

Here are the steps:
1. Read the dimensions \( M \) and \( N \) from the input file `tort.in`.
2. Compute the GCD of \( M \) and \( N \).
3. Compute the size of the square \( L \) as the GCD.
4. Compute the number of such squares as \( \frac{M \times N}{L^2} \).
5. Write the results to the output file `tort.out`.

Here is the C++ code implementing this logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("tort.in");
    std::ofstream fout("tort.out");

    int M, N;
    fin >> M >> N;

    // Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of M and N
    int L = std::gcd(M, N);

    // Calculate the number of L x L squares that fit in the M x N rectangle
    int numSquares = (M / L) * (N / L);

    // Output the result
    fout << numSquares << " " << L << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the dimensions \( M \) and \( N \) from the input file `tort.in`.
2. **Computing GCD**: The `std::gcd` function from the `<algorithm>` library is used to find the greatest common divisor of \( M \) and \( N \). This gives us the largest possible square side \( L \).
3. **Calculating Number of Squares**: The number of such squares is calculated by dividing the area of the rectangle by the area of one square, which simplifies to \( \frac{M \times N}{L^2} \) or equivalently \( (M / L) \times (N / L) \).
4. **Writing Output**: The results are written to the output file `tort.out`.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(\log(\min(M, N))) \) due to the GCD calculation, and it meets the constraints provided.

Evaluate the error message. Think of a solution to fix the program and return the entire source code with the fix.

The error message indicates that the `std::gcd` function is not recognized. This is likely because `std::gcd` is available only in C++17 and later. To ensure compatibility, we need to specify the C++17 standard during compilation or use a custom GCD function if the environment does not support C++17.

Here is the revised solution with a custom GCD function:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

// Custom function to calculate GCD
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("tort.in");
    std::ofstream fout("tort.out");

    int M, N;
    fin >> M >> N;

    // Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of M and N
    int L = gcd(M, N);

    // Calculate the number of L x L squares that fit in the M x N rectangle
    int numSquares = (M / L) * (N / L);

    // Output the result
    fout << numSquares << " " << L << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Custom GCD Function**: A custom `gcd` function is implemented using the Euclidean algorithm. This function repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
2. **Rest of the Code**: The rest of the code remains unchanged and continues to read from `tort.in`, compute the number of squares and their size, and write the results to `tort.out`.

This should now compile and run correctly in any standard C++ environment.
