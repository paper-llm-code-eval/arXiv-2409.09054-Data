# Cerință

Cunoscând câte un număr de pe fiecare linie a triunghiului, determinaţi toate numerele de pe linia $1$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `triunghi.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii din triunghi. Pe următoarele $n$ linii sunt descrise informaţiile despre triunghi. Mai exact, pe linia $i$ dintre cele $n$ se află două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $p_i \ v_i$ indicând poziţia şi respectiv valoarea numărului cunoscut de pe linia $i$ a triunghiului.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `triunghi.out` va conține o singură linie, pe care se găsesc $n$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând în ordine de la stânga la dreapta numerele scrise pe linia $1$ a triunghiului.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq p_i \leq n+1-i$;
* Toate numerele din triunghi sunt numere naturale cu cel mult $18$ cifre.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to reconstruct the numbers on the first line of the triangle using the given numbers from each line. We can use dynamic programming to achieve this. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Read Input**: Read the input values from the file `triunghi.in`.
2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use a 2D array to store the values of the triangle.
3. **Populate Known Values**: Fill the known values into the appropriate positions in the triangle.
4. **Reconstruct the Triangle**: Starting from the known values, work upwards to reconstruct the values of the triangle.
5. **Output the Result**: Write the values of the first line to the file `triunghi.out`.

Here is the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    // Initialize a 2D vector to store the triangle values
    std::vector<std::vector<long long>> triangle(n, std::vector<long long>(n, 0));

    // Read the known values and fill them in the triangle
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int pos;
        long long value;
        infile >> pos >> value;
        triangle[n - 1 - i][pos - 1] = value;
    }

    // Reconstruct the triangle from bottom to top
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i + 1][j] + triangle[i + 1][j + 1];
        }
    }

    // Output the first line of the triangle
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (j > 0) {
            outfile << " ";
        }
        outfile << triangle[0][j];
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the number of lines `n`.
   - We then read the known values for each line and store them in a 2D vector `triangle`.

2. **Initializing Data Structures**:
   - We use a 2D vector `triangle` of size `n x n` initialized to zero to store the values of the triangle.

3. **Populating Known Values**:
   - For each known value, we place it in the appropriate position in the `triangle` vector. The position is adjusted based on the line number.

4. **Reconstructing the Triangle**:
   - We start from the second last line and move upwards.
   - For each position, we calculate the value as the sum of the two values directly below it.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - We write the values of the first line of the triangle to the output file `triunghi.out`.

This approach ensures that the triangle is reconstructed correctly and efficiently. The use of dynamic programming helps to minimize redundant calculations, making the solution both fast and optimal.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests that there might be an issue with how the known values are being placed or how the triangle is being reconstructed. Let's re-evaluate the approach and fix any potential issues.

### Analysis

1. **Reading Input**: Ensure that the input is read correctly.
2. **Populating Known Values**: Ensure that the known values are placed correctly in the triangle.
3. **Reconstructing the Triangle**: Ensure that the values are calculated correctly from the bottom to the top.

### Potential Issues

- **Incorrect Placement**: Ensure that the known values are placed in the correct positions.
- **Reconstruction Logic**: Ensure that the reconstruction logic correctly sums the values from the bottom to the top.

### Revised Approach

1. **Read Input**: Read the input values from the file `triunghi.in`.
2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use a 2D array to store the values of the triangle.
3. **Populate Known Values**: Fill the known values into the appropriate positions in the triangle.
4. **Reconstruct the Triangle**: Starting from the known values, work upwards to reconstruct the values of the triangle.
5. **Output the Result**: Write the values of the first line to the file `triunghi.out`.

    std::ifstream infile("triunghi.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("triunghi.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    // Initialize a 2D vector to store the triangle values
    std::vector<std::vector<long long>> triangle(n);

    // Read the known values and fill them in the triangle
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int pos;
        long long value;
        infile >> pos >> value;
        triangle[i].resize(i + 1, 0);
        triangle[i][pos - 1] = value;
    }

    // Reconstruct the triangle from bottom to top
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i + 1][j] + triangle[i + 1][j + 1];
        }
    }

    // Output the first line of the triangle
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (j > 0) {
            outfile << " ";
        }
        outfile << triangle[0][j];
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Initialization**: The `triangle` vector is initialized correctly with each row having the appropriate number of elements.
2. **Placement of Known Values**: The known values are placed correctly in the `triangle` vector.
3. **Reconstruction Logic**: The reconstruction logic is applied correctly from the bottom to the top.

```

**Expected Output (`triunghi.out`)**:
```

The revised code should now produce the correct output.

The persistent segmentation fault indicates a serious issue with memory management. Given that the error occurs consistently, it is likely related to how the 2D vector is being managed.

Let's take a more careful approach to ensure proper memory handling and avoid segmentation faults. We'll use a fixed-size array instead of a dynamically resizing vector to eliminate potential issues with memory allocation.

### Revised Approach

1. **Read Input**: Read the input values from the file `triunghi.in`.
2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use a fixed-size 2D array to store the values of the triangle.
3. **Populate Known Values**: Fill the known values into the appropriate positions in the triangle.
4. **Reconstruct the Triangle**: Starting from the known values, work upwards to reconstruct the values of the triangle.
5. **Output the Result**: Write the values of the first line to the file `triunghi.out`.

        triangle[i][pos - 1] = value;
    }

    // Reconstruct the triangle from bottom to top
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i + 1][j] + triangle[i + 1][j + 1];
        }
    }

    // Output the first line of the triangle
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (j > 0) {
            outfile << " ";
        }
        outfile << triangle[0][j];
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Initialization**: The `triangle` array is initialized with a fixed size to ensure that each element is properly allocated.
2. **Placement of Known Values**: The known values are placed correctly in the `triangle` array.
3. **Reconstruction Logic**: The reconstruction logic is applied correctly from the bottom to the top.

### Testing

To ensure the solution is correct, you can test it with the provided example:

**Input (`triunghi.in`)**:
```
5
4 4
2 5
3 13
2 25
1 45
```

**Expected Output (`triunghi.out`)**:
```
1 2 3 4 2
```

The revised code should now produce the correct output without causing a segmentation fault. If the issue persists, further debugging will be necessary to identify the exact cause of the segmentation fault.
