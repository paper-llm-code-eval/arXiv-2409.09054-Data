Directorul unei școli dorește să premieze la sfârșitul anului școlar pe cei mai buni elevi la învățătură. Pentru acest lucru el are de rezolvat două probleme:

1. Să determine câți elevi vor fi premiați dintre cei $n$ elevi ai școlii. După discuții aprinse cu ceilalți profesori se hotărăște în Consiliul Profesoral ca numărul premianților să fie $n - k$, unde $k$ este cel mai mare număr pătrat perfect mai mic strict decât $n$. De exemplu, pentru $n = 150$, $k$ este $144$ (pentru că $144$ = $12^2$), deci vor fi premiați $150 - 144 = 6$ elevi.
2. Pentru a fi cât mai multă liniște la premiere, în Consiliul Profesoral se ia decizia ca elevii care nu vor fi premiați să fie așezați pe terenul de sport pe rânduri de câte $p$ elevi (unde $p^2 = k$). În acest scop, directorul a numerotat elevii nepremiați de la $1$ la $k$ și a hotărât ca elevii să fie așezați în ordinea descrescătoare a numerelor asociate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de elevi din școală și calculează numărul de elevi premiați precum și modul de așezare a elevilor nepremiați.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `lascoala.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `lascoala.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul de elevi premiați, iar pe următoarele linii așezarea elevilor nepremiați.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 700$;

        outfile << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of students `n` from the file `lascoala.in`.
2. **Finding the Largest Perfect Square Less Than `n`**: The largest perfect square `k` less than `n` is calculated by taking the square root of `n`, subtracting 1, and squaring the result.
3. **Calculating the Number of Students to be Awarded**: The number of students to be awarded is `n - k`, which is written to the output file.
4. **Seating Arrangement**: The students who are not awarded are arranged in a grid of size `p x p` where `p` is the square root of `k`. The students are numbered in descending order starting from `k`.
5. **Outputting the Seating Arrangement**: The seating arrangement is written to the output file.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the constraints provided.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the calculation of the largest perfect square less than `n` was incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the largest integer `x` such that `x^2` is less than `n`. Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("lascoala.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("lascoala.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    // Find the largest perfect square less than n
    int x = static_cast<int>(std::sqrt(n));
    int k = x * x;

    // Number of students to be awarded
    int num_awarded = n - k;
    outfile << num_awarded << std::endl;

    // Number of students per row
    int p = x;

    // Prepare the seating arrangement
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> seating(p, std::vector<int>(p));
    int num = k;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < p; ++j) {
            seating[i][j] = num--;
        }
    }

    // Output the seating arrangement
    for (const auto& row : seating) {
        for (int student : row) {
            outfile << student << " ";
        }
        outfile << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of students `n` from the file `lascoala.in`.
2. **Finding the Largest Perfect Square Less Than `n`**: The largest perfect square `k` less than `n` is calculated by finding the integer part of the square root of `n`, and then squaring it.
3. **Calculating the Number of Students to be Awarded**: The number of students to be awarded is `n - k`, which is written to the output file.
4. **Seating Arrangement**: The students who are not awarded are arranged in a grid of size `p x p` where `p` is the integer part of the square root of `k`. The students are numbered in descending order starting from `k`.
5. **Outputting the Seating Arrangement**: The seating arrangement is written to the output file.

This corrected solution should now match the expected output for the given input.

The primary difference between the expected and found result is the presence of trailing spaces at the end of each line in the found output. This discrepancy is due to the way the seating arrangement is being outputted. To fix this, we need to ensure that there are no trailing spaces at the end of each line.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("lascoala.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("lascoala.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    // Find the largest perfect square less than n
    int x = static_cast<int>(std::sqrt(n - 1));
    int k = x * x;

    // Number of students to be awarded
    int num_awarded = n - k;
    outfile << num_awarded << std::endl;

    // Number of students per row
    int p = x;

    // Prepare the seating arrangement
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> seating(p, std::vector<int>(p));
    int num = k;
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < p; ++j) {
            seating[i][j] = num--;
        }
    }

    // Output the seating arrangement
    for (const auto& row : seating) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < row.size(); ++j) {
            outfile << row[j];
            if (j < row.size() - 1) {
                outfile << " ";
            }
        }
        outfile << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```
