Copa ajunse în Orintia unde există un templu cu mai multe nivele, baza fiind un pătrat de lungime $L$. Primul nivel are înălţimea egală cu $N$, iar celelalte nivele au înălţimea mai mare cu o unitate faţă de cel anterior. Spre exemplu pentru $L = 5$ şi $N = 3$ din stâncă răsări templul (imagine din avion şi de la sol): Copa deschise un document vechi şi citi: „Ca să afli cât aur este în templu, trebuie să însumezi numărul de metri de pe fiecare orizontală…”. Şi Copa socoti: $3+3+3+3+3=15$; $3+4+4+4+3=18$; $3+4+5+4+3=19$; celelalte $18$ şi $15$. „Apoi, trebuie să afli suma numerelor obţinute…”. Iar Copa îşi notă numărul $85$. „Toate numerele obţinute se lipesc pentru a forma cel mai mic număr posibil…”. Şi Copa obţinu numărul: $151518181985$. „Din numărul acesta se caută cel mai mare număr de două cifre alăturate. Aceasta este cantitatea de aur din templu.”. Şi Copa ţipă de bucurie: $98$!.

# Cerință

Plecaţi în Orintia! Veţi primi cele două numere $N$ şi $L$ şi vi se cere să determinaţi numărul obţinut din sume şi cantitatea de aur.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `templu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $N$ şi $L$ separate printr-un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `templu.out` va conţine două linii. Pe câte o linie se va scrie câte un număr. Pe prima linie numărul obţinut din sume, iar pe a doua linie cantitatea de aur.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq L \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq N \leq 50$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Certainly! Let's break down the problem step-by-step and then implement the solution in C++.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the values of `N` and `L` from the input file `templu.in`.

2. **Calculating the Sums:**
   - For each level of the temple, calculate the sum of the heights of the blocks.
   - The first level has a constant height `N`.
   - Each subsequent level increases in height by 1 until the middle, then decreases back to `N`.

3. **Forming the Number from Sums:**
   - Concatenate the sums of each level to form a single number.

4. **Finding the Maximum Two-Digit Number:**
   - Traverse the concatenated number to find the maximum two-digit number.

5. **Writing Output:**
   - Write the concatenated number and the maximum two-digit number to the output file `templu.out`.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `N = 3` and `L = 5`:
- Levels and their sums:
  - Level 1: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15
  - Level 2: 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 18
  - Level 3: 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 19
  - Level 4: 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 18
  - Level 5: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15
- Concatenated number: 151518181985
- Maximum two-digit number: 98

### C++ Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("templu.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("templu.out");
    
    int N, L;
    infile >> N >> L;
    
    std::string concatenated;
    int max_two_digit = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) {
        int level_sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < L; ++j) {
            int height = N + std::min(i, L - 1 - i);
            level_sum += height;
        }
        concatenated += std::to_string(level_sum);
    }
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < concatenated.size() - 1; ++i) {
        int two_digit = (concatenated[i] - '0') * 10 + (concatenated[i + 1] - '0');
        if (two_digit > max_two_digit) {
            max_two_digit = two_digit;
        }
    }
    
    outfile << concatenated << std::endl;
    outfile << max_two_digit << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `templu.in`.
   - We read the integers `N` and `L`.

2. **Calculating the Sums:**
   - We loop through each level `i` from 0 to `L-1`.
   - For each level, we calculate the sum of heights of blocks.
   - The height of each block is `N + std::min(i, L - 1 - i)`.

3. **Forming the Number from Sums:**
   - We concatenate the sums into a string `concatenated`.

4. **Finding the Maximum Two-Digit Number:**
   - We traverse the string `concatenated` to find the maximum two-digit number.

5. **Writing Output:**
   - We use `ofstream` to write the results to `templu.out`.

This solution is efficient and should work within the constraints provided.

1. **Level Sum Calculation:**
   - The calculation for level sums seems incorrect. The height of each block should increase by 1 for each step away from the center, but the provided solution uses a different logic.

2. **Concatenation Logic:**
   - The concatenation logic seems correct, but due to incorrect level sums, the concatenated number is wrong.

3. **Finding Maximum Two-Digit Number:**
   - This part of the code is correct, but since the concatenated number is incorrect, the result is also incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Level Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the sum of heights for each level correctly.
   - For each level, the height should increase by 1 for each step away from the center.

        if (two_digit > max_two_digit) {
            max_two_digit = two_digit;
        }
    }
    
    outfile << concatenated << std::endl;

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `templu.in`.
   - We read the integers `N` and `L`.

2. **Calculating the Sums:**
   - We loop through each level `i` from 0 to `L-1`.
   - For each level, we calculate the sum of heights of blocks.
   - The height of each block is `N + std::min({i, j, L - 1 - i, L - 1 - j})`, which ensures the height increases correctly as we move away from the center.

3. **Forming the Number from Sums:**
   - We concatenate the sums into a string `concatenated`.

4. **Finding the Maximum Two-Digit Number:**
   - We traverse the string `concatenated` to find the maximum two-digit number.

5. **Writing Output:**
   - We use `ofstream` to write the results to `templu.out`.

This corrected solution should now produce the expected output for the given example.

Thank you for your patience. Let's thoroughly analyze the problem and the current solution to identify where it went wrong and correct it.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Read the values of `N` and `L` from the input file `templu.in`.

2. **Level Sum Calculation:**
   - For each level, calculate the sum of the heights of the blocks.
   - The first level has a constant height `N`.
   - Each subsequent level increases in height by 1 until the middle, then decreases back to `N`.

3. **Forming the Number from Sums:**
   - Concatenate the sums of each level to form a single number.

4. **Finding the Maximum Two-Digit Number:**
   - Traverse the concatenated number to find the maximum two-digit number.

5. **Output:**
   - Write the concatenated number and the maximum two-digit number to the output file `templu.out`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For `N = 3` and `L = 5`:
- Levels and their sums:
  - Level 1: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15
  - Level 2: 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 18
  - Level 3: 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 19
  - Level 4: 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 18
  - Level 5: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15
- Concatenated number: 151518181985
- Maximum two-digit number: 98

### Corrected Solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("templu.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("templu.out");
    
    int N, L;
    infile >> N >> L;
    
    std::string concatenated;
    int max_two_digit = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) {
        int level_sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < L; ++j) {
            int height = N + std::min({i, j, L - 1 - i, L - 1 - j});
            level_sum += height;
        }
        concatenated += std::to_string(level_sum);
    }
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < concatenated.size() - 1; ++i) {
        int two_digit = (concatenated[i] - '0') * 10 + (concatenated[i + 1] - '0');
        if (two_digit > max_two_digit) {
            max_two_digit = two_digit;
        }
    }
    
    outfile << concatenated << std::endl;
    outfile << max_two_digit << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
