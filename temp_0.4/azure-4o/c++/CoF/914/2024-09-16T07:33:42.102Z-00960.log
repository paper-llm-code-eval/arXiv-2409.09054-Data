După ce a primit de la Simonet, profesorul său de studii sociale, tema pentru proiect, tânărului Trevor i-a venit ideea jocului ”Pay it forward”. Pentru cei care nu știu acest joc, el constă în ajutarea de către Trevor a oamenilor aflați la ananghie. Aceștia la rândul lor vor ajuta alți oameni și așa mai departe.

Fiecare participant (inclusiv Trevor) trebuie să realizeze câte $k$ fapte bune prin care să ajute oamenii. Vârstnicii și tinerii își îndeplinesc în mod diferit această sarcină. Vârstnicii au nevoie de $\text{zv}$ zile pentru a introduce în joc o altă persoană, iar tinerii au nevoie de $\text{zt}$ zile. Astfel dacă un vârstnic, respectiv un tânăr, intră în joc în ziua $i$, el va introduce la rândul lui în joc prima persoană în ziua $i+\text{zv}$, respectiv în ziua $i+\text{zt}$ tânărul, a doua persoană în ziua $i+2*\text{zv}$, respectiv în ziua $i+2*\text{zt}$ tânărul și așa mai departe. Astfel numărul de persoane care participă la joc poate fi diferit în funcție de cum sunt alese persoanele vârstnice și cele tinere. Trevor dorește ca în joc să fie realizate în total cât mai multe fapte bune, dar fiecare participant să aducă în joc maximum $(k+1)/2$ tineri și maximum $(k+1)/2$ vârstnici. Participanții pot aduce mai puține persoane de un anumit tip, dar nu au voie să depășească numărul de $(k+1)/2$ persoane de același tip.

# Cerință

Care este numărul $\text{fb}$ de fapte bune care mai sunt de realizat, după trecerea a $n$ zile, de către persoanele intrate deja în joc, astfel încât numărul total de fapte bune așteptate (și cele realizate și cele nerealizate) să fie maxim?

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `pif.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $n$, pe a doua linie numărul $k$ și pe a treia linie numerele $\text{zv}$ și $\text{zt}$ separate printr-un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `pif.out` se va scrie restul împărțirii lui $\text{fb}$, cu semnificația din enunț, la $1234567$ ($\text{fb} % 1234567$).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$;
* $1 \leq k, \text{zt}, \text{zv} \leq n$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $30$ de puncte $\text{fb} \leq 10^6$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $30$ de puncte $\text{zv} = \text{zt} = 1$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $20$ de puncte $\text{zv} = \text{zt} \neq 1$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $70$ de puncte $k \cdot n \leq 10^6$;

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1234567;

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("pif.in");
    std::ofstream output("pif.out");

    int n, k, zv, zt;
    input >> n >> k >> zv >> zt;

    // Maximum number of people each participant can bring into the game
    int max_people = (k + 1) / 2;

    // We will use a vector to keep track of the number of good deeds remaining for each day
    std::vector<long long> good_deeds(n + 1, 0);

    // Trevor starts the game on day 0
    good_deeds[0] = 1;

    for (int day = 0; day <= n; ++day) {
        if (good_deeds[day] > 0) {
            // Calculate the number of good deeds to be done by the participants entering the game on this day
            long long deeds = good_deeds[day] * k;

            // Add new participants to the game
            for (int i = 1; i <= max_people; ++i) {
                if (day + i * zv <= n) {
                    good_deeds[day + i * zv] += good_deeds[day];
                }
                if (day + i * zt <= n) {
                    good_deeds[day + i * zt] += good_deeds[day];
                }
            }

            // Update the number of good deeds remaining for this day
            good_deeds[day] = deeds;
        }
    }

    // Sum up all the good deeds remaining after n days
    long long total_good_deeds = 0;
    for (int day = 0; day <= n; ++day) {
        total_good_deeds = (total_good_deeds + good_deeds[day]) % MOD;
    }

    output << total_good_deeds << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads from `pif.in` and writes to `pif.out`. It uses a vector to track the number of good deeds remaining for each day and updates it based on the rules provided. The final result is the sum of all good deeds remaining after `n` days, modulo `1234567`.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the key aspects to ensure we derive the correct solution.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Participants and Good Deeds**:
   - Each participant (including Trevor) needs to perform `k` good deeds.
   - Each participant can bring in at most `(k + 1) / 2` young people and `(k + 1) / 2` elderly people into the game.

2. **Time Delays**:
   - Elderly people take `zv` days to bring in another person.
   - Young people take `zt` days to bring in another person.

3. **Objective**:
   - We need to calculate the number of good deeds left to be performed after `n` days, modulo `1234567`.

### Approach

1. **Simulation**:
   - Use a queue to simulate the process of participants bringing in new participants over the days.
   - Track the remaining good deeds for each day.

2. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use a vector to keep track of the number of good deeds remaining for each day.
   - Iterate through each day and update the good deeds based on the current participants.

### Revised Solution

Here is the corrected and optimized solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

const int MOD = 1234567;

struct Participant {
    int day;
    int remaining_deeds;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("pif.in");
    std::ofstream output("pif.out");

    int n, k, zv, zt;
    input >> n >> k >> zv >> zt;

    int max_people = (k + 1) / 2;
    std::vector<long long> good_deeds(n + 1, 0);
    std::queue<Participant> queue;

    // Trevor starts the game on day 0
    queue.push({0, k});
    good_deeds[0] = k;

    while (!queue.empty()) {
        Participant current = queue.front();
        queue.pop();

        int day = current.day;
        int remaining_deeds = current.remaining_deeds;

        if (day > n) continue;

        for (int i = 1; i <= max_people; ++i) {
            if (day + i * zv <= n) {
                good_deeds[day + i * zv] += remaining_deeds;
                good_deeds[day + i * zv] %= MOD;
                queue.push({day + i * zv, remaining_deeds});
            }
            if (day + i * zt <= n) {
                good_deeds[day + i * zt] += remaining_deeds;
                good_deeds[day + i * zt] %= MOD;
                queue.push({day + i * zt, remaining_deeds});
            }
        }
    }

    long long total_good_deeds = 0;
    for (int day = 0; day <= n; ++day) {
        total_good_deeds = (total_good_deeds + good_deeds[day]) % MOD;
    }

    output << total_good_deeds << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Trevor starts the game on day 0 with `k` good deeds.
   - Use a queue to manage participants and their remaining deeds.

2. **Simulation**:
   - For each participant, calculate the days they will bring new participants into the game.
   - Update the good deeds for those days and push new participants into the queue.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Sum up all the good deeds remaining after `n` days, modulo `1234567`.

This solution ensures that we correctly simulate the process and calculate the number of good deeds left after `n` days.

I apologize for the previous errors. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and correct the solution with a more thorough approach.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Participants and Good Deeds**:
   - Each participant (including Trevor) needs to perform `k` good deeds.
   - Each participant can bring in at most `(k + 1) / 2` young people and `(k + 1) / 2` elderly people into the game.

2. **Time Delays**:
   - Elderly people take `zv` days to bring in another person.
   - Young people take `zt` days to bring in another person.

3. **Objective**:
   - We need to calculate the number of good deeds left to be performed after `n` days, modulo `1234567`.

### Correct Approach

1. **Simulation**:
   - Use a vector to simulate the number of good deeds remaining for each day.
   - Track the good deeds for each day and update based on the current participants.

### Revised Solution

Here is the corrected and optimized solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

const int MOD = 1234567;

struct Participant {
    int day;
    int remaining_deeds;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream input("pif.in");
    std::ofstream output("pif.out");

    int n, k, zv, zt;
    input >> n >> k >> zv >> zt;

    int max_people = (k + 1) / 2;
    std::vector<long long> good_deeds(n + 1, 0);

    // Trevor starts the game on day 0
    good_deeds[0] = 1;

    for (int day = 0; day <= n; ++day) {
        if (good_deeds[day] > 0) {
            long long participants = good_deeds[day];

            for (int i = 1; i <= max_people; ++i) {
                if (day + i * zv <= n) {
                    good_deeds[day + i * zv] = (good_deeds[day + i * zv] + participants) % MOD;
                }
                if (day + i * zt <= n) {
                    good_deeds[day + i * zt] = (good_deeds[day + i * zt] + participants) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    long long total_good_deeds = 0;
    for (int day = 0; day <= n; ++day) {
        total_good_deeds = (total_good_deeds + good_deeds[day] * k) % MOD;
    }

    output << total_good_deeds << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Trevor starts the game on day 0 with 1 participant.
   - Use a vector to manage the number of participants for each day.

2. **Simulation**:
   - For each day, calculate the number of participants and the good deeds they will perform.
   - Update the good deeds for future days based on the current participants.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Sum up all the good deeds performed after `n` days, modulo `1234567`.

This solution ensures that we correctly simulate the process and calculate the number of good deeds left after `n` days. The key fix was to correctly track the number of participants and their contributions to future days.
