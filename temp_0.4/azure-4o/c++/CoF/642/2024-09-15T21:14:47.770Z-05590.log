Definim un număr ***liber de pătrate*** ca fiind un număr natural care nu are ca divizor niciun pătrat perfect mai mare ca $1$. Prin convenție, $1$ este considerat *liber de pătrate*.

Așadar, șirul numerelor *libere de pătrate* este: $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, \dots$

Se consideră un șir de $N$ numere naturale $X_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, unde $N$ este un număr natural.

Definim o ***bisecvență*** ca un subșir nevid obținut prin eliminarea dintr-o secvență a unui număr care nu este la începutul sau la sfârșitul secvenței.

# Cerințe
1) Să se determine câte numere *libere de pătrate* conține șirul dat.
2) Să se determine cea mai lungă *bisecvență* din șir formată din numere *libere de pătrate*, obținută prin eliminarea unui număr care **nu** este *liber de pătrate*.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `oneout.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$, reprezentând cerința, pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$ iar pe a treia linie $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, în fișierul de ieșire `oneout.out` se va scrie numărul de numere *libere de pătrate* din șir.

Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$:
- Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `oneout.out` se vor scrie două numere $L$ și $K$ despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $L$ reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *bisecvențe* cu proprietățile cerute, iar $K$ reprezintă numărul de *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă existente în șir.
- Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor scrie indicii de început și de sfârșit ai fiecărei *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă găsite, în ordinea crescătoare a indicelui de start, despărțite printr-un spațiu.
- Dacă șirul nu conține nicio *bisecvență* cu proprietățile cerute, în fișierul de ieșire se va scrie `-1`.

# Restricții și precizări
- $3 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $2 \leq X_i \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Lungimea unei *bisecvențe* reprezintă numărul de numere din aceasta.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 37 de puncte $C = 1$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 24 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 25$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 63 de puncte $C = 2$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 23 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 101$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently in C++, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Read Input Efficiently**: Since we are not allowed to use `cin` or `cout`, we will use file streams to read from `oneout.in` and write to `oneout.out`.

2. **Determine Square-Free Numbers**: We need to determine if a number is square-free (i.e., it does not have any perfect square divisors other than 1). We can use a sieve-like approach to precompute this for all numbers up to the maximum possible value of \( X_i \) (which is \( 10^6 \)).

3. **Process the Input Based on the Value of C**:
   - If \( C = 1 \), count the number of square-free numbers in the sequence.
   - If \( C = 2 \), find the longest bisubsequence of square-free numbers by removing one non-square-free number.

4. **Output the Result Efficiently**: Write the results to `oneout.out`.

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAX_X = 1000000;

std::vector<bool> isSquareFree(MAX_X + 1, true);

void precomputeSquareFree() {
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= MAX_X; ++i) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= MAX_X; j += i * i) {
            isSquareFree[j] = false;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("oneout.in");
    std::ofstream fout("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    fin >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> X(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> X[i];
    }

    precomputeSquareFree();

    if (C == 1) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (isSquareFree[X[i]]) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        fout << count << "\n";
    } else if (C == 2) {
        std::vector<int> squareFreePrefix(N + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            squareFreePrefix[i + 1] = squareFreePrefix[i] + (isSquareFree[X[i]] ? 1 : 0);
        }

        int maxLength = 0;
        int countMaxLength = 0;
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> bisubsequences;

        for (int i = 1; i < N - 1; ++i) {
            if (!isSquareFree[X[i]]) {
                int currentLength = squareFreePrefix[N] - squareFreePrefix[i + 1] + squareFreePrefix[i];
                if (currentLength > maxLength) {
                    maxLength = currentLength;
                    countMaxLength = 1;
                    bisubsequences = {{1, i}, {i + 2, N}};
                } else if (currentLength == maxLength) {
                    ++countMaxLength;
                    bisubsequences.push_back({1, i});
                    bisubsequences.push_back({i + 2, N});
                }
            }
        }

        if (maxLength == 0) {
            fout << "-1\n";
        } else {
            fout << maxLength << " " << countMaxLength << "\n";
            for (const auto& p : bisubsequences) {
                fout << p.first << " " << p.second << "\n";
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precompute Square-Free Numbers**: We use a sieve-like method to mark non-square-free numbers. This ensures we can quickly check if a number is square-free.

2. **Reading Input**: We read the input values from `oneout.in` using file streams.

3. **Processing Based on C**:
   - For \( C = 1 \), we count the square-free numbers in the sequence.
   - For \( C = 2 \), we compute the longest bisubsequence by removing one non-square-free number. We use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the number of square-free numbers in any subarray.

4. **Output**: We write the results to `oneout.out` using file streams.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints well.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Let's analyze the problem and the solution more carefully.

### Problem Analysis

For `C = 2`, we need to find the longest bisubsequence of square-free numbers by removing exactly one non-square-free number. The bisubsequence should be the longest possible and we need to count how many such bisubsequences exist.

### Bug Analysis

The provided solution has a few issues:
1. It incorrectly counts the bisubsequences.
2. It does not handle the requirement to remove exactly one non-square-free number properly.
3. The output format is not as expected.

### Fixing the Bugs

1. **Correctly Identify Square-Free Numbers**: Ensure the sieve correctly marks non-square-free numbers.

2. **Reading Input**: We read the input values from `oneout.in` using file streams.

3. **Processing Based on C**:
   - For \( C = 1 \), we count the square-free numbers in the sequence.
   - For \( C = 2 \), we compute the longest bisubsequence by removing one non-square-free number. We use two pointers to efficiently find the longest bisubsequence around each non-square-free number.

4. **Output**: We write the results to `oneout.out` using file streams.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints well. The key fix was to ensure that we correctly identify and count the bisubsequences by clearing the list of bisubsequences when a new maximum length is found.

Thank you for your patience. Let's carefully analyze the problem and the discrepancies in the results. We need to ensure that we correctly identify the longest bisubsequence by removing exactly one non-square-free number and only report the correct bisubsequences.

### Problem Analysis

For `C = 2`, we need to find the longest bisubsequence of square-free numbers by removing exactly one non-square-free number. The bisubsequence should be the longest possible, and we need to count how many such bisubsequences exist.

### Bug Analysis

The provided solution incorrectly counts bisubsequences and does not correctly handle the requirement to remove exactly one non-square-free number. Specifically:
1. It includes bisubsequences that do not start and end at the correct positions.
2. It counts multiple bisubsequences incorrectly.

### Fixing the Bugs

1. **Correctly Identify Square-Free Numbers**: Ensure the sieve correctly marks non-square-free numbers.
2. **Correctly Identify Bisubsequences**: Ensure we are removing exactly one non-square-free number and finding the longest possible bisubsequences.
3. **Output the Correct Format**: Ensure the output format matches the requirements.
