Definim un număr ***liber de pătrate*** ca fiind un număr natural care nu are ca divizor niciun pătrat perfect mai mare ca $1$. Prin convenție, $1$ este considerat *liber de pătrate*.

Așadar, șirul numerelor *libere de pătrate* este: $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, \dots$

Se consideră un șir de $N$ numere naturale $X_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, unde $N$ este un număr natural.

Definim o ***bisecvență*** ca un subșir nevid obținut prin eliminarea dintr-o secvență a unui număr care nu este la începutul sau la sfârșitul secvenței.

# Cerințe
1) Să se determine câte numere *libere de pătrate* conține șirul dat.
2) Să se determine cea mai lungă *bisecvență* din șir formată din numere *libere de pătrate*, obținută prin eliminarea unui număr care **nu** este *liber de pătrate*.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `oneout.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$, reprezentând cerința, pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$ iar pe a treia linie $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, în fișierul de ieșire `oneout.out` se va scrie numărul de numere *libere de pătrate* din șir.

Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$:
- Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `oneout.out` se vor scrie două numere $L$ și $K$ despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $L$ reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *bisecvențe* cu proprietățile cerute, iar $K$ reprezintă numărul de *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă existente în șir.
- Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor scrie indicii de început și de sfârșit ai fiecărei *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă găsite, în ordinea crescătoare a indicelui de start, despărțite printr-un spațiu.
- Dacă șirul nu conține nicio *bisecvență* cu proprietățile cerute, în fișierul de ieșire se va scrie `-1`.

# Restricții și precizări
- $3 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $2 \leq X_i \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Lungimea unei *bisecvențe* reprezintă numărul de numere din aceasta.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 37 de puncte $C = 1$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 24 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 25$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 63 de puncte $C = 2$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 23 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 101$.

Let's analyze the issue and fix the solution.

The problem lies in the calculation of the length of the bisubsequence. The length should be the number of elements in the bisubsequence, not the difference between indices. 

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct length calculation and ensure it adheres to the requirements.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to check if a number is square-free
bool isSquareFree(int num) {
    if (num == 1) return true;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; ++i) {
        if (num % (i * i) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("oneout.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    infile >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> numbers(N);
    std::vector<bool> isSquareFreeList(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> numbers[i];
        isSquareFreeList[i] = isSquareFree(numbers[i]);
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int count = 0;
        for (bool isSF : isSquareFreeList) {
            if (isSF) ++count;
        }
        outfile << count << "\n";
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> maxBisubsequences;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (!isSquareFreeList[i]) {
                int left = i - 1;
                int right = i + 1;

                while (left >= 0 && isSquareFreeList[left]) --left;
                while (right < N && isSquareFreeList[right]) ++right;

                int length = (right - 1) - (left + 1) + 1;
                if (length > maxLength) {
                    maxLength = length;

                }
            }
        }

        if (maxLength == 0) {
            outfile << "-1\n";

In this revised solution, the length of the bisubsequence is calculated correctly by counting the number of elements in the bisubsequence. The output is also formatted correctly to match the expected result.

The issue in the previous solution is due to the incorrect calculation of the bisubsequence length. The length should be the number of elements in the bisubsequence, not the difference between indices. Additionally, the bisubsequence should be formed by removing exactly one non-square-free number, not counting the indices incorrectly.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary corrections:

1. Correctly identify and count square-free numbers.
2. Correctly identify bisubsequences by removing one non-square-free number and calculate their lengths accurately.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to check if a number is square-free
bool isSquareFree(int num) {
    if (num == 1) return true;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; ++i) {
        if (num % (i * i) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("oneout.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    infile >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> numbers(N);
    std::vector<bool> isSquareFreeList(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> numbers[i];
        isSquareFreeList[i] = isSquareFree(numbers[i]);
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int count = 0;
        for (bool isSF : isSquareFreeList) {
            if (isSF) ++count;
        }
        outfile << count << "\n";
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> maxBisubsequences;

        for (int i = 1; i < N - 1; ++i) {
            if (!isSquareFreeList[i]) {
                int left = i - 1;
                int right = i + 1;

                while (left >= 0 && isSquareFreeList[left]) --left;
                while (right < N && isSquareFreeList[right]) ++right;

                int length = right - left - 2; // Length of the bisubsequence
                if (length > maxLength) {
                    maxLength = length;
                    maxBisubsequences.clear();
                    maxBisubsequences.push_back({left + 1, right - 1});
                } else if (length == maxLength) {
                    maxBisubsequences.push_back({left + 1, right - 1});
                }
            }
        }

        if (maxLength == 0) {
            outfile << "-1\n";
        } else {
            outfile << maxLength << " " << maxBisubsequences.size() << "\n";
            for (const auto& p : maxBisubsequences) {
                outfile << p.first + 1 << " " << p.second + 1 << "\n";
            }
        }
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the changes:
1. The loop to find bisubsequences starts from index 1 and goes to N-2 to ensure we are removing a non-square-free number that is not at the beginning or end.
2. The length of the bisubsequence is calculated as `right - left - 2` to account for the elements between `left` and `right` after removing the non-square-free number.
3. The indices in the output are adjusted by adding 1 to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing as required by the problem statement.

This should now produce the correct output for the given input.

The issue arises from the fact that the solution is not correctly identifying the longest bisubsequence by removing one non-square-free number. The algorithm is incorrectly counting multiple bisubsequences of the same length without ensuring they are distinct and valid according to the problem's requirements.

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the changes:
1. The loop to find bisubsequences starts from index 1 and goes to N-2 to ensure we are removing a non-square-free number that is not at the beginning or end.
2. The length of the bisubsequence is calculated as `right - left - 2` to account for the elements between `left` and `right` after removing the non-square-free number.
3. The indices in the output are adjusted by adding 1 to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing as required by the problem statement.
4. The bisubsequences are sorted and duplicates are removed to ensure only unique and valid bisubsequences are considered.
5. Additional filtering is applied to ensure only valid bisubsequences of the correct length are included in the final output.

This should now produce the correct output for the given input.

The previous implementation had a logical flaw in the way it identified and managed bisubsequences. Specifically, it didn't correctly handle the identification and counting of valid bisubsequences. 

Let's reimplement the solution with a more robust approach:

1. Correctly identify and count square-free numbers.
2. Correctly identify bisubsequences by removing exactly one non-square-free number and calculate their lengths accurately.
3. Ensure that only valid bisubsequences are considered and avoid duplicates.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to check if a number is square-free
bool isSquareFree(int num) {
    if (num == 1) return true;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; ++i) {
        if (num % (i * i) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("oneout.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("oneout.out");

    int C, N;
    infile >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> numbers(N);
    std::vector<bool> isSquareFreeList(N);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> numbers[i];
        isSquareFreeList[i] = isSquareFree(numbers[i]);
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        int count = 0;
        for (bool isSF : isSquareFreeList) {
            if (isSF) ++count;
        }
        outfile << count << "\n";
    } else if (C == 2) {

                int left = i - 1;
                int right = i + 1;

                while (right < N && isSquareFreeList[right]) ++right;

                int length = right - left - 2; // Length of the bisubsequence
                if (length > maxLength) {
                    maxLength = length;

                }
            }
        }

        if (maxLength == 0) {
            outfile << "-1\n";
        } else {
            // Remove duplicates and sort the bisubsequences
            std::sort(maxBisubsequences.begin(), maxBisubsequences.end());

                }
            }

            }
