Se consideră $N$ puncte din plan, având coordonate numere naturale, relativ la un reper cartezian XOY, oricare două puncte fiind distincte.

~[triunghiuri.png]

# Cerință

Cunoscând $N$ și coordonatele celor $N$ puncte, să se determine:

1. Numărul maxim de puncte care au aceeași abscisă.
2. Numărul triunghiurilor care se pot desena respectând următoarele condiții:
	* au toate vârfurile în puncte dintre cele date;
	* au o latură paralelă cu OX;
	* **nu** au laturi paralele cu OY;

# Date de intrare

Datele de intrare se citesc din fișierul `triunghiuri.in`, care are următoarea structură:

Pe prima linie se află numărul $p$, care indică cerința ce trebuie rezolvată ($p$ are valoarea $1$ sau $2$);
Pe a doua linie se află numărul natural $N$, reprezentând numărul punctelor date;
Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsesc câte două valori naturale $x \ y$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctelor date.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `triunghiuri.out` va avea următoarea structură:

Dacă $p = 1$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul maxim de puncte care au aceeași abscisă (cerința $1$).
Dacă $p = 2$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul triunghiurilor care se pot desena respectând condițiile date, modulo $1 \ 000 \ 003$, adică restul împărțirii numărului de triunghiuri la $1 \ 000 \ 003$ (cerința $2$).

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq x, y \leq 1 000$;
* Se acordă $25$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ și $65$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here's the C++ solution for the given problem. The solution reads from `triunghiuri.in` and writes to `triunghiuri.out` without using `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, or `scanf()`. The solution is optimized for both tasks: finding the maximum number of points with the same x-coordinate and counting the number of valid triangles as specified.

```cpp

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000003;

int main() {

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read using `std::ifstream` for efficiency.
   - The first value `p` determines which task to solve.
   - The second value `N` is the number of points.
   - The subsequent lines contain the coordinates of the points.

2. **Task 1: Maximum Points with Same Abscissa:**
   - We use an `unordered_map<int, int>` to count occurrences of each x-coordinate.
   - The maximum value in this map gives the result.

3. **Task 2: Counting Valid Triangles:**
   - We use an `unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>>` to store y-coordinates for each x-coordinate.
   - For each pair of y-coordinates with the same x, we check for points that can form valid triangles.
   - We ensure the triangles have one side parallel to the x-axis and no sides parallel to the y-axis.
   - The result is computed modulo `1000003`.

This solution is designed to be efficient, leveraging hash maps for quick lookups and counting, and ensuring the operations are within acceptable time complexity for the given constraints.

Let's evaluate the differences and understand why the initial solution didn't produce the expected output.

### Analysis of the Problem
For task 2, we need to count the number of triangles that:
1. Have all vertices among the given points.
2. Have one side parallel to the x-axis.
3. Do not have any sides parallel to the y-axis.

### Issue in Initial Solution
The initial solution did not produce the expected output because:
1. It didn't correctly identify and count the triangles based on the given constraints.
2. The logic for counting triangles was flawed, especially in checking the conditions for valid triangles.

### Correct Approach
1. **Identify pairs of points with the same x-coordinate** to form the base of the triangle.
2. **For each pair**, find points that can form a valid triangle with the base:
   - The third point must not share the same x-coordinate with the base points.
   - The y-coordinate of the third point must be between the y-coordinates of the base points.

### Improved Solution
Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        points[i] = {x, y};
        y_by_x[x].push_back(y);
    }

    if (p == 1) {
        int max_points = 0;
        for (const auto& pair : y_by_x) {
            if (pair.second.size() > max_points) {
                max_points = pair.second.size();

            int y_size = y_coords.size();
            if (y_size < 2) continue;

                for (int j = i + 1; j < y_size; ++j) {
                    int y1 = y_coords[i];
                    int y2 = y_coords[j];
                    for (const auto& point : points) {
                        if (point.first != pair.first && point.second > std::min(y1, y2) && point.second < std::max(y1, y2)) {
                            triangle_count = (triangle_count + 1) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                }

        outfile << triangle_count << "\n";

Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure we correctly understand the requirements and constraints.

### Problem Requirements
For task 2, we need to count the number of triangles that:
1. Have all vertices among the given points.
2. Have one side parallel to the x-axis.
3. Do not have any sides parallel to the y-axis.

### Key Observations
1. **Base of the Triangle**: The base of the triangle must be parallel to the x-axis, meaning it consists of two points with the same y-coordinate.
2. **Third Point**: The third point must have a different y-coordinate and must lie vertically between the y-coordinates of the base points.

### Correct Approach
1. **Group Points by Y-Coordinate**: This allows us to easily find all possible bases for the triangles.

### Explanation of the Improved Solution
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read using `std::ifstream` for efficiency.
   - The first value `p` determines which task to solve.
   - The second value `N` is the number of points.
   - The subsequent lines contain the coordinates of the points.

2. **Task 1: Maximum Points with Same Abscissa:**
   - We use an `unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>>` to store y-coordinates for each x-coordinate.
   - The size of the vector for each x-coordinate gives the count of points with that x-coordinate.
   - The maximum size among these vectors gives the result.

3. **Task 2: Counting Valid Triangles:**
   - We use an `unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>>` to store x-coordinates for each y-coordinate.
   - For each y-coordinate, we consider pairs of x-coordinates to form the base of the triangle.
   - For each pair of x-coordinates, we check all points to see if they can form a valid triangle with the base.
   - The third point must not share the same y-coordinate with the base points and must lie horizontally between the x-coordinates of the base points.
   - The result is computed modulo `1000003`.

This solution ensures that we correctly count the number of valid triangles based on the given constraints.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the discrepancies in the previous solution. The critical part of the problem is to correctly count the number of triangles that meet the given constraints.

### Problem Requirements Recap
For task 2, we need to count the number of triangles that:
1. Have all vertices among the given points.
2. Have one side parallel to the x-axis.
3. Do not have any sides parallel to the y-axis.

### Key Observations
1. **Base of the Triangle**: The base of the triangle must be parallel to the x-axis, meaning it consists of two points with the same y-coordinate.
2. **Third Point**: The third point must have a different y-coordinate and must lie vertically between the y-coordinates of the base points.

### Issue in the Previous Solution
The previous solution did not correctly count the valid triangles because it incorrectly checked the conditions for the third point. Specifically, it should check for points with different y-coordinates and ensure they lie between the x-coordinates of the base points.

### Correct Approach
1. **Group Points by Y-Coordinate**: This allows us to easily find all possible bases for the triangles.
2. **Check Valid Third Points**: For each base, check all other points to see if they can form a valid triangle.

### Improved Solution
Let's implement the solution with the correct approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000003;

int main() {

    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> x_by_y;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> y_by_x;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        points[i] = {x, y};
        x_by_y[y].push_back(x);
        y_by_x[x].push_back(y);
    }

    if (p == 1) {
        int max_points = 0;
        for (const auto& pair : y_by_x) {
            if (pair.second.size() > max_points) {
                max_points = pair.second.size();
            }
        }

    } else if (p == 2) {

            const std::vector<int>& x_coords = pair.second;
            int y = pair.first;
            int x_size = x_coords.size();
            if (x_size < 2) continue;
            for (int i = 0; i < x_size; ++i) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < x_size; ++j) {
                    int x1 = x_coords[i];
                    int x2 = x_coords[j];
                    for (const auto& point : points) {
                        if (point.second != y && point.first > std::min(x1, x2) && point.first < std::max(x1, x2)) {
                            triangle_count = (triangle_count + 1) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        outfile << triangle_count << "\n";
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
