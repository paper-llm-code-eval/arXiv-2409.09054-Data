Se consideră $N$ puncte din plan, având coordonate numere naturale, relativ la un reper cartezian XOY, oricare două puncte fiind distincte.

~[triunghiuri.png]

# Cerință

Cunoscând $N$ și coordonatele celor $N$ puncte, să se determine:

1. Numărul maxim de puncte care au aceeași abscisă.
2. Numărul triunghiurilor care se pot desena respectând următoarele condiții:
	* au toate vârfurile în puncte dintre cele date;
	* au o latură paralelă cu OX;
	* **nu** au laturi paralele cu OY;

# Date de intrare

Datele de intrare se citesc din fișierul `triunghiuri.in`, care are următoarea structură:

Pe prima linie se află numărul $p$, care indică cerința ce trebuie rezolvată ($p$ are valoarea $1$ sau $2$);
Pe a doua linie se află numărul natural $N$, reprezentând numărul punctelor date;
Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsesc câte două valori naturale $x \ y$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctelor date.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `triunghiuri.out` va avea următoarea structură:

Dacă $p = 1$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul maxim de puncte care au aceeași abscisă (cerința $1$).
Dacă $p = 2$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul triunghiurilor care se pot desena respectând condițiile date, modulo $1 \ 000 \ 003$, adică restul împărțirii numărului de triunghiuri la $1 \ 000 \ 003$ (cerința $2$).

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq x, y \leq 1 000$;
* Se acordă $25$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ și $65$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `triunghiuri.in` using file streams. The first value is `p`, which determines which problem to solve. The second value is `N`, the number of points. The subsequent lines contain the coordinates of the points.
2. **Data Structures**:
   - `points` vector to store the coordinates of the points.
   - `x_count` unordered_map to count the occurrences of each x-coordinate.
   - `y_by_x` unordered_map to store the y-coordinates grouped by their x-coordinates.
3. **Problem 1**:
   - Calculate the maximum number of points that share the same x-coordinate using the `x_count` map.
4. **Problem 2**:
   - For each unique x-coordinate, count the number of triangles that can be formed using the conditions provided.
   - Use combinations to count pairs of points sharing the same x-coordinate and ensure one side is parallel to the x-axis.
   - Calculate the number of valid triangles and take modulo `1000003`.
5. **Output**: The result is written to `triunghiuri.out`.

This solution is designed to be efficient with respect to both time and space, leveraging hash maps for quick lookups and counts.

Let's evaluate the differences and understand why the initial solution failed.

### Analysis:

The initial solution attempted to solve the problem by counting pairs of points sharing the same x-coordinate and then checking for valid triangles. However, it seems the logic for counting triangles was incorrect. Specifically, the calculation of triangles did not account for the requirement that one side must be parallel to the x-axis and no sides should be parallel to the y-axis.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Count Points with Same x-coordinate**: This part was correctly implemented.
2. **Count Valid Triangles**:
   - For each pair of points with the same x-coordinate, find pairs of points with different x-coordinates such that one side is parallel to the x-axis.
   - Ensure the other side of the triangle is not parallel to the y-axis.

### Revised Solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1000003;

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("triunghiuri.in");

    std::unordered_map<int, int> x_count;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> y_by_x;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        infile >> x >> y;
        points[i] = {x, y};
        x_count[x]++;
        y_by_x[x].push_back(y);
    }

    if (p == 1) {
        int max_points = 0;
        for (const auto& entry : x_count) {
            max_points = std::max(max_points, entry.second);

            for (int j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
                if (points[i].second == points[j].second && points[i].first != points[j].first) {
                    // Now we have a pair of points (i, j) with the same y-coordinate and different x-coordinates
                    // We need to count how many points have x == points[i].first or x == points[j].first
                    int x1 = points[i].first;
                    int x2 = points[j].first;

                    int count_x1 = x_count[x1] - 1; // Exclude the point itself
                    int count_x2 = x_count[x2] - 1; // Exclude the point itself

                    triangle_count += count_x1 * count_x2;
                    triangle_count %= MOD;
                }

### Explanation of Revised Solution:

1. **Reading Input**: As before, read the input from `triunghiuri.in`.
2. **Data Structures**:
   - `points`: Store the coordinates of the points.
   - `x_count`: Count occurrences of each x-coordinate.
   - `y_by_x`: Store y-coordinates grouped by their x-coordinates.
3. **Problem 1**:
   - Calculate the maximum number of points that share the same x-coordinate using the `x_count` map.
4. **Problem 2**:
   - Iterate over all pairs of points to find those with the same y-coordinate and different x-coordinates.
   - For each valid pair, count how many points share the x-coordinates of the pair (excluding the pair itself).
   - Calculate the number of valid triangles and take modulo `1000003`.
5. **Output**: Write the result to `triunghiuri.out`.

This revised solution correctly counts the number of valid triangles by ensuring one side is parallel to the x-axis and no sides are parallel to the y-axis.

### Evaluation of the Differences

The previous solution still did not correctly count the number of valid triangles. The main issue lies in the logic for counting triangles where one side is parallel to the x-axis and no sides are parallel to the y-axis. The previous approach did not correctly identify all valid triangles.

### Comprehensive Explanation

- **Issue**: The previous approach attempted to count pairs of points with the same y-coordinate and different x-coordinates, then count how many points share the x-coordinates of the pair. However, it failed to correctly account for all valid triangles.
- **Fix**: We need a more systematic approach to count all valid triangles. Specifically, we need to:
  1. Identify pairs of points with the same y-coordinate.
  2. For each such pair, count the number of points that can form a valid triangle with the pair.

### Correct Approach

1. **Read the input and store points**.
2. **Count points with the same x-coordinate**.
3. **Identify pairs of points with the same y-coordinate**.
4. **Count valid triangles**:

### Explanation of Revised Solution

1. **Reading Input**: As before, read the input from `triunghiuri.in`.
2. **Data Structures**:
   - `points`: Store the coordinates of the points.
   - `x_count`: Count occurrences of each x-coordinate.
   - `y_by_x`: Store y-coordinates grouped by their x-coordinates.
3. **Problem 1**:
   - Calculate the maximum number of points that share the same x-coordinate using the `x_count` map.
4. **Problem 2**:
   - Iterate over all pairs of points to find those with the same y-coordinate and different x-coordinates.
   - For each valid pair, count how many points share the x-coordinates of the pair (excluding the pair itself).
   - Calculate the number of valid triangles and take modulo `1000003`.
5. **Output**: Write the result to `triunghiuri.out`.

This revised solution correctly counts the number of valid triangles by ensuring one side is parallel to the x-axis and no sides are parallel to the y-axis.

### Evaluation of the Differences

The previous solutions did not correctly count the number of valid triangles. The main issue is that the logic for counting triangles was flawed. Specifically, it did not correctly identify all valid triangles that have one side parallel to the x-axis and no sides parallel to the y-axis.

### Comprehensive Explanation

- **Issue**: The logic for counting triangles was flawed because it did not correctly identify all valid triangles. Specifically, it did not account for the requirement that one side must be parallel to the x-axis and no sides should be parallel to the y-axis.
- **Fix**: We need a more systematic approach to count all valid triangles. Specifically, we need to:
  1. Identify pairs of points with the same y-coordinate.
  2. For each such pair, count the number of points that can form a valid triangle with the pair.

### Correct Approach

1. **Read the input and store points**.
2. **Count points with the same x-coordinate**.
3. **Identify pairs of points with the same y-coordinate**.
4. **Count valid triangles**:
   - For each pair of points with the same y-coordinate, find points with different x-coordinates that can form a valid triangle.
