Mihai a primit de ziua lui un joc de puzzle. Jocul are $N$ piese confecționate prin lipirea unor bucăți de dimensiune $1 \cdot 1$ (ilustrate în figurile de mai jos prin `X`); aceste bucăți le vom numi în continuare, pe scurt, `X`-uri. Pentru confecționarea unei piese se respectă următoarele reguli:

* `X`-urile sunt așezate unul peste altul, formând coloane ce pot avea înălțimi diferite, apoi coloanele se aliniază în partea de jos și se lipesc între ele, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta;
* Pe o coloană sunt cel mult $9$ `X`-uri;
* Toate piesele au același număr de coloane.

~[puzzle.jpg|align=center]

În figurile $1, 2, 3, 4$ sunt piese de puzzle care respectă regulile descrise, iar în figura $5$ și în figura $6$ **NU** sunt piese de puzzle, pentru că nu pot fi obținute prin lipirea unor coloane de $X$-uri, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta.
Fiind mic, Mihai nu poate rezolva puzzle-ul, dar poate face o singură operație: alege două piese și le îmbină în dreptul laturilor de sus, răsturnând una dintre piese sus-jos (fără să o rotească sau să o răstoarne stânga-dreapta). Dacă în urma acestei operații el obține un dreptunghi format din coloane complete de $X$-uri, toate coloanele având aceeași înălțime, este mulțumit. De exemplu, piesa din figura $1$ și cea din figura $2$ pot fi îmbinate în modul descris.
În figura $7$ este piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos. În figura $8$ este ilustrat dreptunghiul care se obține din piesa din figura $1$ și piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos.
Observați că, dacă am roti piesa din figura $4$, am putea să o îmbinăm cu piesa din figura $1$, dar rotația nu este permisă.
Vom codifica o piesă printr-un număr natural, fiecare cifră din număr reprezentând (în ordine de la stânga la dreapta) câte $X$-uri se află pe coloana corespunzătoare din piesă.
De exemplu:
- piesa din figura $1$ este codificată $4232$;
- piesa din figura $2$ este codificată $1323$;
- piesa din figura $3$ este codificată $4444$;
- piesa din figura $4$ este codificată $3231$.

# Cerință

Determinați care este numărul de moduri în care Mihai poate alege câte două piese dintre cele $N$ pentru a face o operație în modul descris mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `puzzle.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă numărul de piese din joc. Pe linia a doua se găsesc $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, reprezentând codificările celor $N$ piese.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `puzzle.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris numărul cerut.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$;
* Numerele care reprezintă codificările pieselor au același număr de cifre (cel mult $5$) și nu conțin cifra $0$.
* Într-o operație nu contează care dintre piese este răsturnată, ca urmare perechea formată din piesa $a$ și piesa $b$ este considerată ca fiind aceeași cu perechea formată din piesa $b$ și piesa $a$.
* Dreptunghiul obținut în urma unei operații poate avea înălțimea mai mare decât $9$.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $N \leq 1 \ 000$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this challenge efficiently, we need to determine how many pairs of pieces can be combined to form a rectangle by flipping one of them vertically. The key observation is that a piece can be combined with another piece if the sum of their corresponding columns is the same for all columns.

Given the constraints, we can use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each piece and its vertically flipped version. By doing this, we can quickly count the number of valid pairs.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of pieces and their codifications from the input file.
2. **Store Frequencies**: Use a hash map to store the frequency of each piece and its flipped version.
3. **Count Valid Pairs**: For each unique piece, count how many times it can pair with its flipped version.
4. **Output the Result**: Write the result to the output file.

Now, let's implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> piece_count;
    std::string piece;

    // Read all pieces and count their frequencies
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> piece;
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;

    // Iterate through the map and count valid pairs
    for (const auto& entry : piece_count) {
        std::string original = entry.first;
        std::string flipped = original;

        // Flip the piece vertically
        std::reverse(flipped.begin(), flipped.end());

        // If the flipped version exists in the map, count the pairs
        if (piece_count.find(flipped) != piece_count.end()) {
            if (original == flipped) {
                // If the piece is the same as its flipped version, count combinations
                valid_pairs += (entry.second * (entry.second - 1)) / 2;
            } else if (original < flipped) {
                // Count pairs only once to avoid duplicates
                valid_pairs += entry.second * piece_count[flipped];
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of pieces `N` and their codifications from the input file.
2. **Storing Frequencies**: We use an unordered map `piece_count` to store the frequency of each piece.
3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: We iterate through the map and for each piece, we compute its flipped version by reversing the string. If the flipped version exists in the map, we count the pairs. Special care is taken to avoid counting the same pair twice by ensuring we only count pairs where the original piece is lexicographically smaller than the flipped piece.
4. **Outputting the Result**: Finally, we write the result to the output file.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(N * M) where N is the number of pieces and M is the maximum length of the piece codification (at most 5). This should be performant enough given the constraints.

Let's analyze the problem again and identify where the previous solution went wrong.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the number of valid pairs of puzzle pieces that can be combined to form a rectangle by flipping one of them vertically. The key observation is that two pieces can be combined if the sum of their corresponding columns is the same for all columns.

### Issues in Previous Solution

1. **Counting Pairs Incorrectly**: The previous solution only counted pairs where the original piece is lexicographically smaller than the flipped piece. This approach misses pairs where the original and flipped pieces are the same.
2. **Handling Identical Pieces**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where a piece is identical to its flipped version. It should count combinations of such pieces.

### Correct Approach

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of pieces and their codifications from the input file.
2. **Store Frequencies**: Use a hash map to store the frequency of each piece and its vertically flipped version.
3. **Count Valid Pairs**: For each unique piece, count how many times it can pair with its flipped version.
4. **Output the Result**: Write the result to the output file.

### Plan

- Read the input values.
- Use a hash map to store the frequency of each piece.
- For each piece, generate its flipped version and check if it exists in the map.
- Count the valid pairs considering both identical and different pieces.
- Write the result to the output file.

### Implementation

Here's the corrected implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

    std::string piece;

    // Read all pieces and count their frequencies
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> piece;
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;

    // Iterate through the map and count valid pairs
    for (const auto& entry : piece_count) {
        std::string original = entry.first;
        std::string flipped = original;

        // Flip the piece vertically
        std::reverse(flipped.begin(), flipped.end());

        if (original == flipped) {
            // If the piece is the same as its flipped version, count combinations
            valid_pairs += (entry.second * (entry.second - 1)) / 2;
        } else if (piece_count.find(flipped) != piece_count.end()) {
            // Count pairs only once to avoid duplicates
            if (original < flipped) {
                valid_pairs += entry.second * piece_count[flipped];
            }
        }
    }

    outfile << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The expected output is `3`. Let's manually verify the pairs:
- `222` and `222` (flipped: `222`)
- `432` and `234` (flipped: `432`)
- `234` and `432` (flipped: `234`)

### Key Observations

2. We should consider both the piece and its flipped version.

### Correct Approach

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of pieces and their codifications from the input file.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("puzzle.in");

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> piece;
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;

    // Iterate through the map and count valid pairs
    for (const auto& entry : piece_count) {
        std::string original = entry.first;
        std::string flipped = original;

        // Flip the piece vertically
        std::reverse(flipped.begin(), flipped.end());

        std::cout << "Original: " << original << ", Flipped: " << flipped << std::endl;

        if (piece_count.find(flipped) != piece_count.end()) {
            if (original == flipped) {
                // If the piece is the same as its flipped version, count combinations
                valid_pairs += (entry.second * (entry.second - 1)) / 2;
            } else if (original < flipped) {
                // Count pairs only once to avoid duplicates
                valid_pairs += entry.second * piece_count[flipped];

        }
    }

    outfile << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Debugging Output

Run the program with debugging statements and compare the output to understand where the logic might be failing.

By examining the debugging output, we can identify if there are any issues with how pairs are being counted or if any pieces are being missed.

### Conclusion

By adding debugging statements, we can trace the logic step-by-step and ensure that all valid pairs are being counted correctly. This will help us identify any issues in the logic and correct them to match the expected output.

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the current approach to identify why the results are differing. The core issue seems to be in how we are counting the valid pairs.

### Problem Recap

We need to determine the number of valid pairs of puzzle pieces that can be combined to form a rectangle by flipping one of them vertically. Two pieces can be combined if the sum of their corresponding columns is the same for all columns.

### Example Analysis

Given the input:
```
5
222 432 234 123 111

The expected output is `3`. Let's manually verify the pairs:
- `222` and `222` (flipped: `222`)
- `432` and `234` (flipped: `432`)
- `234` and `432` (flipped: `234`)

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of pieces `N` and their codifications from the input file.
2. **Storing Frequencies**: We use an unordered map `piece_count` to store the frequency of each piece.
3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: We iterate through the map and for each piece, we compute its flipped version by reversing the string. If the piece is the same as its flipped version, we count combinations of such pieces. Otherwise, we count pairs where the original piece is lexicographically smaller than the flipped piece to avoid duplicates. We use an additional map `visited` to ensure we don't count the same pair multiple times.
4. **Outputting the Result**: Finally, we write the result to the output file.

### Debugging

Let's add some debugging statements to understand why the result might be incorrect.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> piece_count;
    std::string piece;

    // Read all pieces and count their frequencies
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> piece;
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, bool> visited;

    // Iterate through the map and count valid pairs
    for (const auto& entry : piece_count) {
        std::string original = entry.first;
        std::string flipped = original;

        // Flip the piece vertically
        std::reverse(flipped.begin(), flipped.end());

        if (visited[original]) continue;
        visited[original] = true;
        visited[flipped] = true;

        std::cout << "Original: " << original << ", Flipped: " << flipped << std::endl;

        if (original == flipped) {
            // If the piece is the same as its flipped version, count combinations
            valid_pairs += (entry.second * (entry.second - 1)) / 2;
        } else if (piece_count.find(flipped) != piece_count.end()) {
            // Count pairs only once to avoid duplicates
            valid_pairs += entry.second * piece_count[flipped];
        }
    }

    outfile << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Debugging Output

Run the program with debugging statements and compare the output to understand where the logic might be failing.

By examining the debugging output, we can trace the logic step-by-step and ensure that all valid pairs are being counted correctly. This will help us identify any issues in the logic and correct them to match the expected output.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the approach to identify where the previous solution might be going wrong. The key issue seems to be in correctly identifying and counting the valid pairs.

### Problem Recap

We need to determine the number of valid pairs of puzzle pieces that can be combined to form a rectangle by flipping one of them vertically. Two pieces can be combined if the sum of their corresponding columns is the same for all columns.

### Example Analysis

Given the input:
```
5
222 432 234 123 111
```
The expected output is `3`. Let's manually verify the pairs:
- `222` and `222` (flipped: `222`)
- `432` and `234` (flipped: `432`)
- `234` and `432` (flipped: `234`)

### Key Observations

1. **Flipping and Pairing**: Two pieces can be combined if the sum of their corresponding columns is equal.
2. **Symmetry**: We need to consider both the piece and its flipped version, and ensure we count each valid pair only once.

### Correct Approach

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of pieces and their codifications from the input file.
2. **Store Frequencies**: Use a hash map to store the frequency of each piece.
3. **Count Valid Pairs**: For each piece, generate its flipped version and check if it exists in the map. Count the valid pairs considering both identical and different pieces.
4. **Output the Result**: Write the result to the output file.

### Implementation

Here is the corrected implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("puzzle.out");

    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> piece_count;
    std::string piece;

    // Read all pieces and count their frequencies
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> piece;
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;

    // Iterate through the map and count valid pairs
    for (const auto& entry : piece_count) {
        std::string original = entry.first;
        std::string flipped = original;

        // Flip the piece vertically
        std::reverse(flipped.begin(), flipped.end());

        if (original == flipped) {
            // If the piece is the same as its flipped version, count combinations
            valid_pairs += (entry.second * (entry.second - 1)) / 2;
        } else if (piece_count.find(flipped) != piece_count.end()) {
            // Count pairs only once to avoid duplicates
            valid_pairs += entry.second * piece_count[flipped];
        }
    }

    outfile << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
