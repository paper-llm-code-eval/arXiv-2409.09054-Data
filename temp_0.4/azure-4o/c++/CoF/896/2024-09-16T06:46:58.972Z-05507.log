Mihai a primit de ziua lui un joc de puzzle. Jocul are $N$ piese confecționate prin lipirea unor bucăți de dimensiune $1 \cdot 1$ (ilustrate în figurile de mai jos prin `X`); aceste bucăți le vom numi în continuare, pe scurt, `X`-uri. Pentru confecționarea unei piese se respectă următoarele reguli:

* `X`-urile sunt așezate unul peste altul, formând coloane ce pot avea înălțimi diferite, apoi coloanele se aliniază în partea de jos și se lipesc între ele, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta;
* Pe o coloană sunt cel mult $9$ `X`-uri;
* Toate piesele au același număr de coloane.

~[puzzle.jpg|align=center]

În figurile $1, 2, 3, 4$ sunt piese de puzzle care respectă regulile descrise, iar în figura $5$ și în figura $6$ **NU** sunt piese de puzzle, pentru că nu pot fi obținute prin lipirea unor coloane de $X$-uri, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta.
Fiind mic, Mihai nu poate rezolva puzzle-ul, dar poate face o singură operație: alege două piese și le îmbină în dreptul laturilor de sus, răsturnând una dintre piese sus-jos (fără să o rotească sau să o răstoarne stânga-dreapta). Dacă în urma acestei operații el obține un dreptunghi format din coloane complete de $X$-uri, toate coloanele având aceeași înălțime, este mulțumit. De exemplu, piesa din figura $1$ și cea din figura $2$ pot fi îmbinate în modul descris.
În figura $7$ este piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos. În figura $8$ este ilustrat dreptunghiul care se obține din piesa din figura $1$ și piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos.
Observați că, dacă am roti piesa din figura $4$, am putea să o îmbinăm cu piesa din figura $1$, dar rotația nu este permisă.
Vom codifica o piesă printr-un număr natural, fiecare cifră din număr reprezentând (în ordine de la stânga la dreapta) câte $X$-uri se află pe coloana corespunzătoare din piesă.
De exemplu:
- piesa din figura $1$ este codificată $4232$;
- piesa din figura $2$ este codificată $1323$;
- piesa din figura $3$ este codificată $4444$;
- piesa din figura $4$ este codificată $3231$.

# Cerință

Determinați care este numărul de moduri în care Mihai poate alege câte două piese dintre cele $N$ pentru a face o operație în modul descris mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `puzzle.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă numărul de piese din joc. Pe linia a doua se găsesc $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, reprezentând codificările celor $N$ piese.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `puzzle.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris numărul cerut.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$;
* Numerele care reprezintă codificările pieselor au același număr de cifre (cel mult $5$) și nu conțin cifra $0$.
* Într-o operație nu contează care dintre piese este răsturnată, ca urmare perechea formată din piesa $a$ și piesa $b$ este considerată ca fiind aceeași cu perechea formată din piesa $b$ și piesa $a$.
* Dreptunghiul obținut în urma unei operații poate avea înălțimea mai mare decât $9$.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $N \leq 1 \ 000$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here is the C++ solution for the given puzzle problem. The solution reads from `puzzle.in`, processes the data to find the number of valid pairs of pieces that can form a rectangle when one of them is flipped upside-down, and writes the result to `puzzle.out`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream fout("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<std::string> pieces(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> pieces[i];
    }

    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> piece_count;
    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;

    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        std::string flipped_piece = piece;
        std::reverse(flipped_piece.begin(), flipped_piece.end());

        if (piece_count[flipped_piece] > 0) {
            if (piece == flipped_piece) {
                valid_pairs += (piece_count[piece] - 1);
            } else {
                valid_pairs += piece_count[flipped_piece];
            }
        }
    }

    valid_pairs /= 2; // Since each pair is counted twice

    fout << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of pieces `N`.
   - Read the `N` pieces into a vector `pieces`.

2. **Counting Pieces**:
   - Use an unordered map `piece_count` to count the occurrences of each piece.

3. **Finding Valid Pairs**:
   - Iterate through each piece and create its flipped version by reversing the string.
   - Check if the flipped version exists in the map.
   - If it exists, add the count of the flipped version to `valid_pairs`.
   - If the piece is the same as its flipped version, adjust the count to avoid over-counting.
   - Since each pair is counted twice, divide the final count by 2.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Write the result to `puzzle.out`.

This solution is efficient due to the use of hash maps for counting and quick lookups, ensuring it runs in linear time relative to the number of pieces.

Let's analyze why the initial solution did not produce the expected result. 

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find pairs of pieces such that when one piece is flipped upside-down, the resulting combination forms a rectangle with all columns having the same height. 

### Key Points:
1. Each piece is represented by a string of digits.
2. We need to find pairs of these strings such that one string is the reverse of the other.
3. The solution must account for the fact that each pair is counted twice and avoid over-counting.

### Issue in Initial Solution:
The initial solution failed because it did not correctly handle the counting of pairs and the condition where a piece is compared to itself. Specifically:
- The condition `if (piece == flipped_piece)` was not correctly adjusting the count for cases where the piece and its flipped version are the same.
- The logic for counting pairs was not accurately reflecting the required combinations.

### Correct Approach:
1. Use a map to count the occurrences of each piece.
2. Iterate through each piece and find its reverse.
3. For each piece, check how many times its reverse appears in the list.
4. Adjust the count for pairs where the piece and its reverse are identical.
5. Sum up the valid pairs, ensuring each pair is counted only once.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the corrected C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream fout("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<std::string> pieces(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> pieces[i];
    }

    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> piece_count;
    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;

    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        std::string flipped_piece = piece;
        std::reverse(flipped_piece.begin(), flipped_piece.end());

        if (piece_count[flipped_piece] > 0) {
            if (piece == flipped_piece) {
                valid_pairs += (piece_count[piece] - 1);
            } else {
                valid_pairs += piece_count[flipped_piece];
            }
            piece_count[piece]--;
        }
    }

    valid_pairs /= 2; // Since each pair is counted twice

    fout << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

   - Read the `N` pieces into a vector `pieces`.

   - Use an unordered map `piece_count` to count the occurrences of each piece.

3. **Finding Valid Pairs**:
   - Iterate through each piece and create its flipped version by reversing the string.
   - Check if the flipped version exists in the map.
   - If the piece is the same as its flipped version, adjust the count to avoid over-counting.
   - Decrement the count of the current piece in the map to ensure it is not reused.
   - Sum up the valid pairs.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Write the result to `puzzle.out`.

This corrected solution ensures that each pair is counted correctly and only once, addressing the issues in the initial implementation.

The previous solution did not correctly count the valid pairs due to a misunderstanding of the problem constraints and logic. Specifically, the solution did not correctly account for all valid pairs and incorrectly decremented the count in the map.

Here's a step-by-step analysis and solution:

### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to find pairs of pieces such that one piece can be flipped upside-down to form a rectangle with uniform column heights.
2. Each piece is represented by a string of digits.
3. We need to count pairs `(a, b)` such that `a` and `b` are either the same or one is the reverse of the other.

### Key Points:
1. Use a map to count the occurrences of each piece.
2. For each piece, find its reverse and check how many times it appears.
3. Adjust the count for pairs where the piece and its reverse are identical.
4. Ensure each pair is counted only once.

            if (piece_count.find(flipped_piece) != piece_count.end()) {
                valid_pairs += piece_count[piece] * piece_count[flipped_piece];
            }

        visited[flipped_piece] = true;

}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of pieces `N`.
   - Read the `N` pieces into a vector `pieces`.

2. **Counting Pieces**:
   - Use an unordered map `piece_count` to count the occurrences of each piece.

3. **Finding Valid Pairs**:
   - Iterate through each piece and create its flipped version by reversing the string.
   - Use a `visited` map to ensure each piece is only processed once.
   - If the piece is the same as its flipped version, calculate the number of pairs using the combination formula `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - If the piece is different from its flipped version, calculate the number of pairs by multiplying the counts of the piece and its flipped version.
   - Mark both the piece and its flipped version as visited.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Write the result to `puzzle.out`.

This corrected solution ensures that each pair is counted correctly and only once, addressing the issues in the initial implementation. The use of the `visited` map ensures that each piece and its flipped version are only processed once, preventing over-counting.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the previous solutions to identify where the logic might be failing.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find pairs of pieces such that when one piece is flipped upside-down, the resulting combination forms a rectangle with all columns having the same height. 

### Key Points:
1. Each piece is represented by a string of digits.
2. We need to find pairs of these strings such that one string is the reverse of the other.
3. The solution must account for the fact that each pair is counted twice and avoid over-counting.

### Issue in Previous Solutions:
The previous solutions did not correctly handle the counting of pairs and the condition where a piece is compared to itself. Specifically:
- The condition `if (piece == flipped_piece)` was not correctly adjusting the count for cases where the piece and its flipped version are the same.
- The logic for counting pairs was not accurately reflecting the required combinations.

### Correct Approach:
1. Use a map to count the occurrences of each piece.
2. Iterate through each piece and find its reverse.
3. For each piece, check how many times its reverse appears in the list.
4. Adjust the count for pairs where the piece and its reverse are identical.
5. Sum up the valid pairs, ensuring each pair is counted only once.

### Revised Solution:
Here is the corrected C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("puzzle.in");
    std::ofstream fout("puzzle.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;

    std::vector<std::string> pieces(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> pieces[i];
    }

    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> piece_count;
    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        piece_count[piece]++;
    }

    int valid_pairs = 0;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, bool> visited;

    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        if (visited[piece]) continue;
        std::string flipped_piece = piece;
        std::reverse(flipped_piece.begin(), flipped_piece.end());

        if (piece == flipped_piece) {
            // Combination of the same piece
            int count = piece_count[piece];
            valid_pairs += (count * (count - 1)) / 2;
        } else {
            // Combination of different pieces
            if (piece_count.find(flipped_piece) != piece_count.end()) {
                valid_pairs += piece_count[piece] * piece_count[flipped_piece];
            }
        }
        visited[piece] = true;
        visited[flipped_piece] = true;
    }

    fout << valid_pairs << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
