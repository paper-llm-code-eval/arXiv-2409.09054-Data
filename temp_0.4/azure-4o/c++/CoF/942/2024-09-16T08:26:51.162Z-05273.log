Se dă un număr $N$, și un șir de $N$ numere naturale nenule.

# Cerință
1. Determinați suma valorilor aflate pe ultimele $K$ poziții în șir (unde $K$ reprezintă valoarea celei mai din dreapta cifre nenule a primei valori din șir).
2. Ne imaginăm împărțirea șirului în secvențe în următorul mod: prima secvență este formată din primele $L$ elemente, a doua este formată din următoarele $L - 1$ elemente, a treia este formată din următoarele $L - 2$ elemente și așa mai departe, ultima secvență este formată dintr-un singur element și acesta **coincide cu ultimul element din șir**. Considerând suma valorilor fiecărei secvențe, să se determine cea mai mare dintre aceste sume.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului `sss.in` se află două valori $C$ și $N$ separate printr-un spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu. Pentru $C = 1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$ iar pentru $C = 2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `sss.out` conține un singur număr care reprezintă valoarea calculată conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Valorile din șir sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 100 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că pentru testele în care $C = 1$ șirul are cel puțin $K$ elemente;
* Se garantează că valoarea lui N permite descompunerea conform descrierii, pentru testele care au $C = 2$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $51$ de puncte avem $C = 1$;
* Pentru $27$ de puncte dintre testele în care $C = 1$, primul număr din șir are o cifră;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $49$ de puncte avem $C = 2$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $22$ de puncte dintre cele care au $C = 2$, valoarea lui $N$ este mai mică sau egală cu $10$.
* Denumirea problemei este o prescurtare de la “sume și secvențe”.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Let's break down the problem and create an efficient solution in C++.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Reading Input Efficiently**:
   - We will use file I/O to read from `sss.in` and write to `sss.out`.

2. **Determine the Task**:
   - Based on the value of `C`, we will either solve task 1 or task 2.

3. **Task 1**:
   - Extract the last non-zero digit of the first number to determine `K`.
   - Compute the sum of the last `K` elements in the array.

4. **Task 2**:
   - Break the array into decreasing length sequences.
   - Calculate the sum of each sequence and find the maximum sum.

### Implementation

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("sss.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("sss.out");

    int C, N;
    infile >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> numbers(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> numbers[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        // Task 1
        int firstNumber = numbers[0];
        int K = 0;

        // Find the last non-zero digit of the first number
        while (firstNumber > 0) {
            int digit = firstNumber % 10;
            if (digit != 0) {
                K = digit;
                break;
            }
            firstNumber /= 10;
        }

        // Sum the last K elements
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = N - K; i < N; ++i) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }

        outfile << sum << std::endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        // Task 2
        int L = 1;
        int maxSum = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of each sequence
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int currentSum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < L && i + j < N; ++j) {
                currentSum += numbers[i + j];
            }
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, currentSum);
            ++L;
        }

        outfile << maxSum << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `sss.in` and `ofstream` to write to `sss.out`.
   - We read the values of `C` and `N` and then read the array of numbers.

2. **Task 1**:
   - We determine `K` by extracting the last non-zero digit of the first number.
   - We then sum the last `K` elements of the array.

3. **Task 2**:
   - We calculate the sum of each sequence starting from the beginning of the array with lengths decreasing from `L` to 1.
   - We keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

### Testing the Solution

The provided example:
```
sss.in
1 6
120 4 21 5 31 6
```
The output should be:
```
37
```

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Let's analyze the problem again, especially focusing on Task 2, where the issue seems to lie.

### Analysis of the Problem

For Task 2:
- We need to divide the array into sequences where the first sequence has `L` elements, the second has `L-1` elements, and so on, until the last sequence which has 1 element.
- We need to calculate the sum of each sequence and find the maximum sum.

### Mistake in the Original Code

The original code incorrectly calculated the sequences. It iterated over the array and tried to sum sequences of increasing length starting from each position, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach

1. Start from the beginning of the array and create sequences of decreasing lengths.
2. Calculate the sum of each sequence.
3. Track the maximum sum encountered.

### Implementation

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("sss.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("sss.out");

    int C, N;
    infile >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> numbers(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> numbers[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        // Task 1
        int firstNumber = numbers[0];
        int K = 0;

        // Find the last non-zero digit of the first number
        while (firstNumber > 0) {
            int digit = firstNumber % 10;
            if (digit != 0) {
                K = digit;
                break;
            }
            firstNumber /= 10;
        }

        // Sum the last K elements
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = N - K; i < N; ++i) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }

        outfile << sum << std::endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        // Task 2
        int maxSum = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of each sequence
        for (int i = 0, L = 1; i < N; ++L) {
            currentSum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < L && i + j < N; ++j) {
                currentSum += numbers[i + j];
            }
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, currentSum);
            i += L;
        }

        outfile << maxSum << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `sss.in` and `ofstream` to write to `sss.out`.
   - We read the values of `C` and `N` and then read the array of numbers.

2. **Task 1**:
   - We determine `K` by extracting the last non-zero digit of the first number.
   - We then sum the last `K` elements of the array.

3. **Task 2**:
   - We start from the beginning of the array and create sequences of decreasing lengths.
   - We calculate the sum of each sequence and track the maximum sum encountered.

### Testing the Solution

The provided example:
```
sss.in
2 10
1 4 2 1 3 6 1 6 5 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
11
```

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and produce the expected results.

Thank you for your patience. Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure we correctly implement Task 2 with a clear and accurate approach.

### Analysis of Task 2

For Task 2:
- We need to divide the array into sequences where the first sequence has `L` elements, the second has `L-1` elements, and so on, until the last sequence which has 1 element.
- We need to calculate the sum of each sequence and find the maximum sum.

### Mistake in the Original Code

The original code incorrectly calculated the sequences. It iterated over the array and tried to sum sequences of increasing length starting from each position, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach

1. Start from the beginning of the array and create sequences of decreasing lengths.
2. Calculate the sum of each sequence.
3. Track the maximum sum encountered.

### Correct Implementation

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("sss.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("sss.out");

    int C, N;
    infile >> C >> N;

    std::vector<int> numbers(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        infile >> numbers[i];
    }

    if (C == 1) {
        // Task 1
        int firstNumber = numbers[0];
        int K = 0;

        // Find the last non-zero digit of the first number
        while (firstNumber > 0) {
            int digit = firstNumber % 10;
            if (digit != 0) {
                K = digit;
                break;
            }
            firstNumber /= 10;
        }

        // Sum the last K elements
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = N - K; i < N; ++i) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }

        outfile << sum << std::endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        // Task 2
        int maxSum = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of each sequence
        for (int L = 1, start = 0; start + L <= N; ++L) {
            int currentSum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < L; ++j) {
                currentSum += numbers[start + j];
            }
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, currentSum);
            start += L;
        }

        outfile << maxSum << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
