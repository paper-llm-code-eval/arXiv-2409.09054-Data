Locuitorii planetei Agria, numiţi agri, au hotărât ca în celebrul an $2012$ să le explice pământenilor cum trebuie cules „eficient” un rând cu $n$ porumbi, numerotaţi, în ordine, cu $1$, $2$, $3$,..., $n$.

Cei $n$ porumbi sunt culeşi de mai mulţi agri. Primul agri merge de-a lungul rândului, plecând de la primul porumb şi culege primul porumb întâlnit, al treilea, al cincilea şi aşa mai departe până la capătul rândului.

Atunci când ajunge la capătul rândului, porneşte al doilea agri şi culege porumbi respectând aceeaşi regulă ca şi primul agri.

Metoda se repetă până când toţi porumbii sunt culeşi.

Pământeanul Ionel încearcă să descopere ce ascunde această metodă şi se gândeşte câţi porumbi culege primul agri, câţi agri culeg un rând cu $n$ porumbi, la a câta trecere este cules porumbul cu numărul $x$ şi care este numărul ultimului porumb cules.

Exemplu: Dacă pe un rând sunt $n = 14$ porumbi atunci sunt $4$ agri care culeg porumbii:

~[porumb.png]

* primul agri culege porumbii $1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $9$, $11$, $13$;
* al doilea agri culege porumbii $2$, $6$, $10$, $14$;
* al treilea agri culege porumbii $4$ şi $12$;
* ultimul agri culege porumbul $8$.

# Cerință

Pentru a-l ajuta pe Ionel să descopere secretul acestei metode, scrieţi un program care citeşte cele două numere naturale $n$ şi $x$ şi care determină:

* numărul de porumbi culeşi de primul agri;
* numărul de agri care culeg şirul de $n$ porumbi;
* numărul trecerii la care este cules porumbul cu numărul $x$;
* numărul ultimului porumb cules.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `porumb.in` conține pe prima linie, separate printr-un spaţiu, cele două numere naturale $n$ şi $x$ cu semnificația din enunţ.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `porumb.out` va conține patru linii:

* pe prima linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de porumbi culeşi de primul agri;
* pe a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de agri care culeg cei $n$ porumbi;
* pe a treia linie se va scrie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul trecerii la care este cules porumbul $x$;
* pe a patra linie se va scrie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul ultimului porumb cules.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq x \leq n ≤ 10^9$;
* Trecerile se numerotează în ordine, începând cu valoarea 1.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei a) se acordă 10% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţelor a) şi b) se acordă 40% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţelor a), b) şi c) se acordă 70% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a celor patru cerinţe se acordă 100% din punctaj.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("porumb.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("porumb.out");

    long long n, x;
    infile >> n >> x;

    // Number of corns picked by the first agri
    long long first_agri_corns = (n + 1) / 2;

    // Number of agris needed to pick all corns
    long long num_agris = std::log2(n) + 1;

    // The pass number when the x-th corn is picked
    long long pass_number = 0;
    long long current_x = x;
    while (current_x % 2 == 0) {
        current_x /= 2;
        pass_number++;
    }
    pass_number++;

    // The number of the last corn picked
    long long last_corn = n;
    while (last_corn % 2 == 0) {
        last_corn /= 2;
    }

    outfile << first_agri_corns << "\n";
    outfile << num_agris << "\n";
    outfile << pass_number << "\n";
    outfile << last_corn << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the input from `porumb.in`, processes the data, and writes the results to `porumb.out`. The solution is designed to handle the constraints efficiently, ensuring that it performs well even for large values of `n` and `x`. Let's break down the logic used in the code:

1. **First Agri Corns**: The first agri picks every second corn starting from the first corn, so the number of corns picked by the first agri is `(n + 1) / 2`.

2. **Number of Agris**: The number of agris needed to pick all the corns is determined by the number of times you can divide `n` by 2 until it becomes 1, which is given by `log2(n) + 1`.

3. **Pass Number for Corn `x`**: To find out the pass number when the `x`-th corn is picked, we keep dividing `x` by 2 until it becomes odd, counting the number of divisions. The pass number is the count of divisions plus one.

4. **Last Corn Picked**: The last corn picked is the largest odd number less than or equal to `n`. This can be found by continuously dividing `n` by 2 until it becomes odd.

This approach ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient, adhering to the constraints provided.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Let's analyze the differences and identify the issue in the previous solution:

1. **First Agri Corns**: The calculation `(n + 1) / 2` is correct.
2. **Number of Agris**: The calculation `log2(n) + 1` is correct.
3. **Pass Number for Corn `x`**: The calculation is correct.
4. **Last Corn Picked**: The calculation is incorrect. The last corn picked should be the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

The mistake lies in the calculation of the last corn picked. Instead of continuously dividing `n` by 2 until it becomes odd, we need to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

Let's fix the code accordingly:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("porumb.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("porumb.out");

    long long n, x;
    infile >> n >> x;

    // Number of corns picked by the first agri
    long long first_agri_corns = (n + 1) / 2;

    // Number of agris needed to pick all corns
    long long num_agris = std::log2(n) + 1;

    // The pass number when the x-th corn is picked
    long long pass_number = 0;
    long long current_x = x;
    while (current_x % 2 == 0) {
        current_x /= 2;
        pass_number++;
    }
    pass_number++;

    // The number of the last corn picked
    long long last_corn = 1;
    while (last_corn * 2 <= n) {
        last_corn *= 2;
    }

    outfile << first_agri_corns << "\n";
    outfile << num_agris << "\n";
    outfile << pass_number << "\n";
    outfile << last_corn << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **First Agri Corns**: This remains `(n + 1) / 2`.
2. **Number of Agris**: This remains `log2(n) + 1`.
3. **Pass Number for Corn `x`**: This remains the same.
4. **Last Corn Picked**: The calculation is corrected to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. This is done by starting with `last_corn = 1` and multiplying it by 2 until it exceeds `n`.

This correction ensures that the last corn picked is accurately determined as the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, which matches the expected output.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the previous solution actually provided the correct output for the given input. The expected output and the found output match perfectly. However, let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure that the solution is indeed correct and optimal.

To solve the problem, let's break down each requirement and ensure our logic is sound:

1. **Number of Corns Picked by the First Agri**: The first agri picks every second corn starting from the first corn.
2. **Number of Agris Needed**: The number of agris needed to pick all the corns can be determined by how many times we can divide `n` by 2 until we reach 1.
3. **Pass Number for Corn `x`**: To find out the pass number when the `x`-th corn is picked, we keep dividing `x` by 2 until it becomes odd, counting the number of divisions.
4. **Last Corn Picked**: The last corn picked should be the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

Let's ensure our solution is correct and optimal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("porumb.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("porumb.out");

    long long n, x;
    infile >> n >> x;

    // Number of corns picked by the first agri
    long long first_agri_corns = (n + 1) / 2;

    // Number of agris needed to pick all corns
    long long num_agris = std::log2(n) + 1;

    // The pass number when the x-th corn is picked
    long long pass_number = 0;
    long long current_x = x;
    while (current_x % 2 == 0) {
        current_x /= 2;
        pass_number++;
    }
    pass_number++;

    // The number of the last corn picked
    long long last_corn = 1;
    while (last_corn * 2 <= n) {
        last_corn *= 2;
    }

    outfile << first_agri_corns << "\n";
    outfile << num_agris << "\n";
    outfile << pass_number << "\n";
    outfile << last_corn << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Agri Corns**: `(n + 1) / 2` correctly calculates the number of corns picked by the first agri.
2. **Number of Agris**: `log2(n) + 1` correctly calculates the number of agris needed.
3. **Pass Number for Corn `x`**: Dividing `x` by 2 until it becomes odd and counting the divisions gives the correct pass number.
4. **Last Corn Picked**: Finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` ensures the correct last corn picked.

This solution is correct and efficient, adhering to the constraints provided. The found output matches the expected output for the given input. If you have any other specific cases or inputs where the solution might be failing, please provide them for further analysis.

Thank you for your patience. Upon reviewing the problem and the solution, it appears that the output is indeed correct based on the problem requirements. However, I understand that you want a thorough explanation and potential reimplementation to ensure robustness.
