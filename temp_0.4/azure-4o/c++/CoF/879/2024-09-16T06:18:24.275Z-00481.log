Un copil construiește un triunghi cu numerele naturale nenule astfel:

* în vârful triunghiului scrie valoarea $1$;
* completează liniile triunghiului de sus în jos, iar căsuțele de pe aceeași linie de la stânga la dreapta cu numere naturale consecutive, ca în figurile următoare.

~[numere.png]

În figura din stânga este ilustrat un astfel de triunghi având $5$ linii, conținând numerele naturale de la $1$ la $15$. În acest triunghi copilul începe să construiască drumuri, respectând următoarele reguli:

* orice drum începe din $1$;
* din orice căsuță se poate deplasa fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în stânga sa (deplasare codificată cu $1$), fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în dreapta sa (deplasare codficată cu $2$);
* orice drum va fi descris prin succesiunea deplasărilor efectuate.

De exemplu, drumul ilustrat în figura din dreapta poate fi descris astfel: $1$, $2$, $2$, $2$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care rezolvă următoarele două cerințe:

* citește descrierea unui drum și afișează numărul la care se termină drumul;
* citește un număr natural nenul $K$, determină un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$ pentru care suma numerelor prin care trece drumul este maximă și afișează această sumă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numere.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând cerința din problemă care trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$).

* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, a doua linie din fișier conține un număr natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea drumului, iar a treia linie din fișier conține descrierea drumului sub forma a $N$ valori, $1$ sau $2$, separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.
* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$, a doua linie din fișier conține numărul natural $K$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un singur număr natural. Dacă $C = 1$, va fi scris numărul cu care se termină drumul descris în fișierul de intrare. Dacă $C = 2$, va fi scrisă suma maximă a numerelor aflate pe un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $40$ de puncte; pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $50$ de puncte. $10$ puncte se acordă din oficiu.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the challenge efficiently, let's break down the problem into two main parts based on the value of `C`:

1. **If `C` is 1**:
   - We need to follow a path described by a series of moves (1 for left, 2 for right) starting from the top of the triangle (value 1) and determine the final number at the end of the path.

2. **If `C` is 2**:
   - We need to determine a path that ends at a given number `K` such that the sum of the numbers along the path is maximized.

### Solution Explanation

#### Part 1: Determine the Final Number of the Path
- We start at the top of the triangle (value 1).
- For each move, we calculate the next position based on the current position and the move direction (left or right).
- This requires understanding the structure of the triangle and how positions are indexed.

#### Part 2: Maximize the Sum of the Path Ending at `K`
- We need to find a path that ends at `K` with the maximum sum.
- This involves backtracking from `K` to the top of the triangle while keeping track of the maximum sum.

### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("numere.in");
    ofstream fout("numere.out");

    int C;
    fin >> C;

    if (C == 1) {
        int N;
        fin >> N;
        vector<int> path(N);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            fin >> path[i];
        }

        int current_number = 1;
        int current_row = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (path[i] == 1) {
                current_number += current_row;
            } else {
                current_number += current_row + 1;
            }
            current_row++;
        }

        fout << current_number << endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int K;
        fin >> K;

        int current_number = K;
        int current_row = 1;
        while (current_number > current_row) {
            current_number -= current_row;
            current_row++;
        }

        int max_sum = 0;
        while (current_number > 0) {
            max_sum += current_number;
            current_number--;
            current_row--;
        }

        fout << max_sum << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the value of `C` to determine which part of the problem to solve.
   - For `C = 1`, we read the length of the path `N` and the path itself.
   - For `C = 2`, we read the value `K`.

2. **Part 1**:
   - We start at the top of the triangle (value 1).
   - For each move in the path, we update the current number based on the move direction.
   - We keep track of the current row to correctly calculate the next number in the triangle.

3. **Part 2**:
   - We determine the row in which `K` is located.
   - We backtrack from `K` to the top of the triangle, summing the numbers along the way to maximize the sum.

This solution ensures efficient handling of both parts of the problem, adhering to the constraints provided.

Let's analyze why the initial solution did not produce the expected result and then come up with a corrected solution.

### Analysis of the Problem

#### Part 1: Determine the Final Number of the Path
This part is straightforward and seems to be working correctly. We follow the path described by a series of moves starting from the top of the triangle.

#### Part 2: Maximize the Sum of the Path Ending at `K`
The initial solution did not correctly handle the backtracking and summing up of numbers to maximize the sum. The logic for determining the row and backtracking was flawed.

### Correct Approach for Part 2

1. **Identify the Row of `K`**:
   - We need to determine which row the number `K` is in. This can be done by iterating through the rows and summing the numbers until we reach or exceed `K`.

2. **Backtrack from `K` to the Top**:
   - Starting from `K`, we need to move upwards to the top of the triangle while maximizing the sum. This involves choosing the correct parent node at each step.

### Corrected Solution in C++

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("numere.in");
    ofstream fout("numere.out");

    int C;
    fin >> C;

    if (C == 1) {
        int N;
        fin >> N;
        vector<int> path(N);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            fin >> path[i];
        }

        int current_number = 1;
        int current_row = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (path[i] == 1) {
                current_number += current_row;
            } else {
                current_number += current_row + 1;
            }
            current_row++;
        }

        fout << current_number << endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int K;
        fin >> K;

        int current_number = K;
        int current_row = 1;
        int sum = 0;

        // Find the row of K
        while (current_number > current_row) {
            current_number -= current_row;
            current_row++;
        }

        // Backtrack from K to the top
        int row = current_row;
        int position = current_number;
        sum += K;

        while (row > 1) {
            if (position > 1) {
                position--;
            }
            sum += position + (row - 2) * (row - 1) / 2;
            row--;
        }

        fout << sum << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

   - We correctly identify the parent nodes during backtracking to ensure the sum is maximized.

This solution should now correctly handle both parts of the problem, ensuring accurate results for the given constraints.

Let's analyze the problem more carefully and correct the solution for the second part.

### Problem Analysis

For part 2, we need to determine the row in which `K` is located and then find a path that ends at `K` such that the sum of the numbers along the path is maximized.

### Key Observations

1. **Row Calculation**:
   - The numbers in the triangle grow in a specific pattern. The first row has 1 number, the second row has 2 numbers, the third row has 3 numbers, and so on.
   - To find the row of `K`, we can keep summing the row lengths until the sum exceeds or equals `K`.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to backtrack from `K` to the top, always choosing the parent node that maximizes the sum.

### Corrected Approach

1. Calculate the row of `K`.
2. Backtrack from `K` to the top, ensuring that at each step, we choose the path that maximizes the sum.

The exit code 125 typically indicates that there was an issue with the Docker container environment, not necessarily with the code itself. However, since we are focusing on the code, let's ensure that our solution is correct and efficient.

### Problem Analysis

For part 2, we need to determine the row in which `K` is located and then find a path that ends at `K` such that the sum of the numbers along the path is maximized.

### Key Observations

1. **Row Calculation**:
   - The numbers in the triangle grow in a specific pattern. The first row has 1 number, the second row has 2 numbers, the third row has 3 numbers, and so on.
   - To find the row of `K`, we can keep summing the row lengths until the sum exceeds or equals `K`.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to backtrack from `K` to the top, always choosing the parent node that maximizes the sum.

### Correct Approach

1. Calculate the row of `K`.
2. Backtrack from `K` to the top, ensuring that at each step, we choose the path that maximizes the sum.

### Corrected Solution in C++

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("numere.in");
    ofstream fout("numere.out");

    int C;
    fin >> C;

    if (C == 1) {
        int N;
        fin >> N;
        vector<int> path(N);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            fin >> path[i];
        }

        int current_number = 1;
        int current_row = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (path[i] == 1) {
                current_number += current_row;
            } else {
                current_number += current_row + 1;
            }
            current_row++;
        }

        fout << current_number << endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        int K;
        fin >> K;

        // Find the row of K
        int current_number = 1;
        int row = 1;
        while (current_number + row < K) {
            current_number += row;
            row++;
        }

        // Calculate the maximum sum path to K
        int sum = 0;
        int position = K - current_number + 1;

        // Backtrack from K to the top
        while (row >= 1) {
            sum += current_number + position - 1;
            if (position > 1) {
                position--;
            }
            current_number -= (row - 1);
            row--;
        }

        fout << sum << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the value of `C` to determine which part of the problem to solve.
   - For `C = 1`, we read the length of the path `N` and the path itself.
   - For `C = 2`, we read the value `K`.

2. **Part 1**:
   - We start at the top of the triangle (value 1).
   - For each move in the path, we update the current number based on the move direction.
   - We keep track of the current row to correctly calculate the next number in the triangle.

3. **Part 2**:
   - We determine the row in which `K` is located by iterating through the rows and summing the row lengths until the sum exceeds or equals `K`.
   - We then backtrack from `K` to the top of the triangle, summing the numbers along the way to maximize the sum.
   - At each step, we choose the parent node that maximizes the sum by adjusting the position correctly.

This solution should now correctly handle both parts of the problem, ensuring accurate results for the given constraints.
