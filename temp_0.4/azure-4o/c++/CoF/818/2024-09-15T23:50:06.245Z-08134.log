Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `roata.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Initialization**: 
    - `totalSum` to store the total revenue.
    - `queue` to manage the clients waiting for their turn.
    - `exitOrder` to store the order in which clients exit.
    - `cabins` to keep track of the remaining rotations for each cabin.
3. **Processing Clients**:
    - Clients are enqueued with their id and rotations.
    - The total sum is calculated by summing up the rotations of all clients.
4. **Simulating the Wheel**:
    - For each rotation, decrease the remaining rotations for each occupied cabin.
    - If a cabin's rotations reach zero, the client exits and the cabin is marked as empty.
    - New clients are boarded into empty cabins, and the current cabin index is updated.
5. **Output**:
    - The total sum, the order of clients exiting, and the final cabin index are written to `roata.out`.

This solution ensures efficient processing of the input and simulates the wheel's rotations to determine the required outputs.

The issue with the initial solution lies in the way it simulates the rotation and boarding process. Specifically, it fails to correctly manage the clients' boarding and exiting sequence, leading to incorrect results.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that:
1. Clients board the wheel in the correct order.
2. Clients exit the wheel after completing their specified number of rotations.
3. The wheel rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, and we need to track the cabin from which the last client exits.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
    int cabin;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("roata.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    infile >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        infile >> rotations[i];
    }

    int totalSum = 0;
    std::queue<Client> queue;
    std::vector<int> exitOrder;
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, -1); // -1 means the cabin is empty

    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        queue.push({i + 1, rotations[i], -1});
        totalSum += rotations[i];
    }

    int currentCabin = 0;
    while (!queue.empty() || std::any_of(cabins.begin(), cabins.end(), [](int x) { return x != -1; })) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabins[i] != -1) {
                cabins[i]--;
                if (cabins[i] == 0) {
                    exitOrder.push_back(queue.front().id);
                    queue.pop();
                    cabins[i] = -1;
                }
            }
        }

        while (!queue.empty() && cabins[currentCabin] == -1) {
            cabins[currentCabin] = queue.front().rotations;
            queue.front().cabin = currentCabin + 1;
            queue.pop();
            currentCabin = (currentCabin + 1) % n;
        }
    }

    outfile << totalSum << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < exitOrder.size(); ++i) {
        outfile << exitOrder[i] << (i == exitOrder.size() - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
    }
    outfile << (currentCabin == 0 ? n : currentCabin) << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}

The error message indicates that `std::any_of` is not recognized. This is because the `<algorithm>` header, which contains `std::any_of`, was not included.

The previous solution had a critical flaw in the way it managed clients' boarding and exiting sequences. Specifically, it did not correctly track the clients' IDs when they exited the wheel. Instead, it incorrectly used the cabin index as the client ID in the `exitOrder` vector.

To fix this, we need to correctly track the clients' IDs and rotations, ensuring that the correct client exits after completing their specified number of rotations. We can use a priority queue to manage the clients based on their remaining rotations and ensure that they exit in the correct order.

    }

    int totalSum = 0;
    std::queue<Client> queue;
    std::vector<int> exitOrder;
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, -1); // -1 means the cabin is empty

    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        queue.push({i + 1, rotations[i], -1});
        totalSum += rotations[i];
    }

    int currentCabin = 0;
    int time = 0;
    std::vector<int> cabinTime(n, 0); // Time left for each cabin

    while (!queue.empty() || std::any_of(cabins.begin(), cabins.end(), [](int x) { return x != -1; })) {
        // Decrease time for each occupied cabin and check if any client needs to exit
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabins[i] != -1) {
                cabinTime[i]--;
                if (cabinTime[i] == 0) {

                }
            }
        }

        // Board new clients if there are empty cabins
        while (!queue.empty() && cabins[currentCabin] == -1) {

            queue.pop();
            currentCabin = (currentCabin + 1) % n;
        }

        // Increase time
        time++;
    }

    outfile << totalSum << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < exitOrder.size(); ++i) {
        outfile << exitOrder[i] << (i == exitOrder.size() - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
    }
    outfile << (currentCabin == 0 ? n : currentCabin) << "\n";

    infile.close();

The previous solution still had issues with managing the clients' boarding and exiting sequence correctly. Specifically, it did not accurately track the clients' IDs and rotations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Ensure that clients board the wheel in the correct order.
2. Correctly track the clients' IDs and rotations.
3. Ensure that clients exit the wheel after completing their specified number of rotations.
4. Correctly track the cabin from which the last client exits.

Here’s the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Client {
    int id;
    int rotations;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("roata.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("roata.out");

    int n, p;
    infile >> n >> p;

    std::vector<int> rotations(p);
    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        infile >> rotations[i];
    }

    int totalSum = 0;
    std::queue<Client> queue;
    std::vector<int> exitOrder;
    std::vector<int> cabins(n, -1); // -1 means the cabin is empty
    std::vector<int> cabinTime(n, 0); // Time left for each cabin

    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        queue.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
        totalSum += rotations[i];
    }

    int currentCabin = 0;
    int time = 0;

    while (!queue.empty() || std::any_of(cabins.begin(), cabins.end(), [](int x) { return x != -1; })) {
        // Decrease time for each occupied cabin and check if any client needs to exit
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cabins[i] != -1) {
                cabinTime[i]--;
                if (cabinTime[i] == 0) {
                    exitOrder.push_back(cabins[i]);
                    cabins[i] = -1;
                }
            }
        }

        // Board new clients if there are empty cabins
        while (!queue.empty() && cabins[currentCabin] == -1) {
            cabins[currentCabin] = queue.front().id;
            cabinTime[currentCabin] = queue.front().rotations;
            queue.pop();
            currentCabin = (currentCabin + 1) % n;
        }

        // Increase time
        time++;
    }

    outfile << totalSum << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < exitOrder.size(); ++i) {
        outfile << exitOrder[i] << (i == exitOrder.size() - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
    }
    outfile << (currentCabin == 0 ? n : currentCabin) << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `roata.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Initialization**: 
    - `totalSum` to store the total revenue.
    - `queue` to manage the clients waiting for their turn.
    - `exitOrder` to store the order in which clients exit.
    - `cabins` to keep track of the remaining rotations for each cabin.
    - `cabinTime` to keep track of the time left for each cabin.
3. **Processing Clients**:
    - Clients are enqueued with their id and rotations.
    - The total sum is calculated by summing up the rotations of all clients.
4. **Simulating the Wheel**:
    - For each rotation, decrease the remaining rotations for each occupied cabin.
    - If a cabin's rotations reach zero, the client exits and the cabin is marked as empty.
    - New clients are boarded into empty cabins, and the current cabin index is updated.
5. **Output**:
    - The total sum, the order of clients exiting, and the final cabin index are written to `roata.out`.

This solution ensures efficient processing of the input and simulates the wheel's rotations to determine the required outputs.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly manage the sequence of clients boarding and exiting the wheel. Specifically, it incorrectly updates the cabin index and does not properly track the order in which clients should exit.

    std::vector<int> cabins(n, -1); // -1 means the cabin is empty

    for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
        queue.push({i + 1, rotations[i]});
        totalSum += rotations[i];
    }

            currentCabin = (currentCabin + 1) % n;
        }

        // Increase time
        time++;
    }

    outfile << totalSum << "\n";

    }
    outfile << (currentCabin == 0 ? n : currentCabin) << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
