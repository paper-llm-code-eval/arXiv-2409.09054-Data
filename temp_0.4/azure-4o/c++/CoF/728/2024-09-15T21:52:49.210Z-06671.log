Vânătorul șef al regelui Arthur a primit însărcinare să vâneze primele rațe ce se întorc din țările calde. Regele fiind un tip cu idei fixe, i-a cerut vânătorului să vâneze rațele albe cu săgeți albe, iar rațele negre cu săgeți negre.

Rațele vin în rânduri (stoluri) din ce în ce mai mari: mai întâi una, apoi două, trei, cinci, opt, treisprezece, ș.a.m.d. Se observă că numărul de rațe dintr-un rând este egal cu numărul de rațe de pe cele două rânduri anterioare. Rațele fiind niște creaturi ordonate zboară în rânduri, în care nu vei putea găsi două rațe de aceeași culoare alăturate, fiecare rând începând cu o rață albă.

Vânătorul știe că dacă a început să doboare o rață, trebuie să le doboare pe toate de pe rândul acesteia, deoarece supraviețuitoarele vor alerta celelalte rațe și ele nu se vor mai întoarce niciodată, iar vânătorul nostru își va pierde slujba.

# Cerință

Știind că vânătorul a primit $ka$ săgeți albe și $kb$ săgeți negre, trebuie să determinați câte rânduri de rațe a doborât și câte săgeți de fiecare tip i-au rămas, știind că el vrea să-și păstreze slujba.

# Date de intrare

De pe primele două linii ale fișierului de intrare `vanatoare.in` se citesc numerele ka și kb (în această ordine).

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vanatoare.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul de rânduri doborâte
* pe linia a doua numărul de săgeți albe rămase
* pe linia a treia numărul de săgeți negre rămase

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq ka, kb \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("vanatoare.in");
    ofstream fout("vanatoare.out");

    long long ka, kb;
    fin >> ka >> kb;

    vector<long long> ducks = {1, 2}; // Initial rows of ducks
    int rowsShot = 0;
    long long whiteArrows = ka, blackArrows = kb;

        long long currentRow = ducks[ducks.size() - 1] + ducks[ducks.size() - 2];
        ducks.push_back(currentRow);

    fout << whiteArrows << endl;
    fout << blackArrows << endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of white (`ka`) and black (`kb`) arrows from the input file `vanatoare.in`.
2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes the first two rows of ducks based on the Fibonacci sequence (`1` and `2`).
3. **Main Loop**: The program enters a loop where it calculates the next row of ducks based on the sum of the last two rows in the `ducks` vector.
4. **Arrow Calculation**: For each row, it calculates the number of white and black arrows needed. Since the rows start with a white duck and alternate colors, the number of white arrows needed is `(currentRow + 1) / 2` and the number of black arrows needed is `currentRow / 2`.
5. **Arrow Deduction**: If the hunter has enough arrows to shoot all ducks in the current row, it deducts the arrows from the total and increments the count of rows shot. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
6. **Output**: Finally, it writes the number of rows shot and the remaining arrows to the output file `vanatoare.out`.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of rows the hunter can shoot and the remaining arrows by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence and the alternating color pattern of the ducks.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Let's analyze the issue and fix the solution.

### Analysis

The problem lies in the calculation of the number of arrows needed for each row. The number of ducks in each row follows the Fibonacci sequence, but the calculation for white and black arrows might be off due to the alternating pattern of ducks.

The correct approach should ensure that for each row:
- The number of white arrows needed is half the total number of ducks (rounded up).
- The number of black arrows needed is half the total number of ducks (rounded down).

Given the input `9` white arrows and `10` black arrows, the expected output is `4` rows shot, `2` white arrows remaining, and `6` black arrows remaining. This indicates that the hunter can shoot four rows before running out of arrows.

### Fixing the Solution

Let's rewrite the solution to ensure the correct calculation of arrows needed for each row.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("vanatoare.in");
    ofstream fout("vanatoare.out");

    long long ka, kb;
    fin >> ka >> kb;

    vector<long long> ducks = {1, 2}; // Initial rows of ducks
    int rowsShot = 0;
    long long whiteArrows = ka, blackArrows = kb;

    while (true) {
        long long currentRow = ducks[ducks.size() - 1] + ducks[ducks.size() - 2];
        ducks.push_back(currentRow);

        long long whiteNeeded = (currentRow + 1) / 2;
        long long blackNeeded = currentRow / 2;

        if (whiteArrows >= whiteNeeded && blackArrows >= blackNeeded) {
            whiteArrows -= whiteNeeded;
            blackArrows -= blackNeeded;
            rowsShot++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    fout << rowsShot << endl;
    fout << whiteArrows << endl;
    fout << blackArrows << endl;

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Thank you for pointing out the issue again. Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure the solution correctly handles the input and output requirements.

### Analysis

The problem is that the Fibonacci sequence and the alternating color pattern must be handled correctly. The number of ducks in each row follows the Fibonacci sequence, but the calculation for white and black arrows must be precise.

### Correct Approach

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The number of ducks in each row follows the Fibonacci sequence.
2. **Arrow Calculation**: For each row, the number of white arrows needed is `(currentRow + 1) / 2` (since it starts with a white duck), and the number of black arrows needed is `currentRow / 2`.

### Corrected Solution

Let's rewrite the solution with careful attention to the Fibonacci sequence and the arrow calculations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("vanatoare.in");
    ofstream fout("vanatoare.out");

    long long ka, kb;
    fin >> ka >> kb;

    long long whiteArrows = ka, blackArrows = kb;
    int rowsShot = 0;

    long long a = 1, b = 2; // First two rows
    while (true) {
        long long currentRow = a + b;
        long long whiteNeeded = (currentRow + 1) / 2;
        long long blackNeeded = currentRow / 2;

        if (whiteArrows >= whiteNeeded && blackArrows >= blackNeeded) {
            whiteArrows -= whiteNeeded;
            blackArrows -= blackNeeded;
            rowsShot++;
            a = b;
            b = currentRow;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    fout << rowsShot << endl;
