În faţa palatului Prinţesei Mofturoase se află $N$ peţitori aşezaţi la coadă, unul în spatele celuilalt. Fiecare poartă sub mantie un număr de pietre preţioase pe care doreşte să le ofere prinţesei ca dar de nuntă. Pentru a nu semăna vrajbă în rândurile lor, prinţesa a decis să-i determine ca $N-1$ dintre ei să renunţe în chip paşnic, peţitorul rămas devenind alesul prinţesei (indiferent de numărul de pietre preţioase deţinute de acesta).

Doi peţitori vecini la coadă se pot înţelege între ei astfel: cel care are mai puţine pietre preţioase pleacă de la coadă primind de la celălalt un număr de pietre astfel încât să plece acasă cu un număr dublu de pietre faţă de câte avea. Dacă doi peţitori au acelaşi număr de pietre, unul din ei (nu contează care) pleacă luând toate pietrele vecinului său. 

Un peţitor se poate înţelege la un moment dat cu unul singur dintre cei doi vecini ai săi. După plecarea unui peţitor, toţi cei din spatele lui avansează.

De exemplu: pentru configuraţia alăturată de $5$ peţitori, un şir posibil de negocieri care conduc la reducerea cozii la un singur peţitor este: se înţeleg vecinii $4$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $4$, se înţeleg apoi $1$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $1$, se înţeleg apoi $3$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $3$, se înţeleg $2$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $5$. Astfel peţitorul $2$ câştigă mâna preafrumoasei prinţese, oferindu-i $0$ pietre preţioase ca dar de nuntă.

# Cerință
Fie $P$ numarul de pietre preţioase pe care le are peţitorul care va deveni alesul prinţesei. Se cer valorile distincte ale lui $P$ la care se poate ajunge prin toate succesiunile de negocieri posibile.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `nunta.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie numărul de peţitori: $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 50$). 
- pe a doua linie, $n$ numere naturale din intervalul $[0, 20]$, reprezentând numărul de pietre preţioase pe care le deţin peţitorii, în ordinea în care stau la coadă. 

# Date de ieșire
Fişierul de ieşire `nunta.out` va conţine:
- pe prima linie  numărul $m$ de valori distincte ce pot fi obţinute
- pe a doua linie cele $m$ valori ordonate crescător, reprezentând valorile care se pot obţine.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to simulate the process of reducing the queue of suitors to a single suitor through negotiations. Given the constraints, a dynamic programming approach is suitable. We will use sets to keep track of the distinct values of precious stones each suitor can end up with.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of suitors and their respective number of stones from the input file.
2. **Simulation of Negotiations**: Use a dynamic programming approach to simulate all possible negotiations and keep track of the resulting number of stones.
3. **Result Extraction**: Extract and sort the distinct values of stones that can be obtained by the last remaining suitor.
4. **Output Writing**: Write the results to the output file.

Here's the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ifstream fin("nunta.in");
    ofstream fout("nunta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    vector<int> stones(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> stones[i];
    }

    set<int> results;
    function<void(vector<int>)> dfs = [&](vector<int> current) {
        int size = current.size();
        if (size == 1) {
            results.insert(current[0]);
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; ++i) {
            vector<int> next = current;
            if (current[i] < current[i + 1]) {
                next[i] = 2 * current[i];
                next.erase(next.begin() + i + 1);
            } else if (current[i] > current[i + 1]) {
                next[i + 1] = 2 * current[i + 1];
                next.erase(next.begin() + i);
            } else {
                next[i] = current[i] + current[i + 1];
                next.erase(next.begin() + i + 1);
            }
            dfs(next);
        }
    };

    dfs(stones);

    vector<int> resultVector(results.begin(), results.end());
    sort(resultVector.begin(), resultVector.end());

    fout << resultVector.size() << "\n";
    for (int value : resultVector) {
        fout << value << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: We read the number of suitors `n` and the list of stones they have from `nunta.in`.
2. **DFS Function**: We define a recursive function `dfs` that takes the current state of the suitors' stones and simulates all possible negotiations.
3. **Base Case**: If only one suitor remains, we add the number of stones he has to the `results` set.
4. **Recursive Case**: For each pair of adjacent suitors, we simulate the negotiation, update the list of stones, and recursively call `dfs` with the new list.
5. **Result Extraction**: After all recursive calls, we convert the `results` set to a sorted vector.
6. **Output Writing**: We write the size of the results and the sorted values to `nunta.out`.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of negotiations and capture all distinct outcomes efficiently.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the logic for handling negotiations between suitors is incorrect. Specifically, the negotiation rules were not correctly implemented. Let's re-evaluate the problem and correct the mistakes:

1. **Negotiation Rules**:
   - If two adjacent suitors have different numbers of stones, the one with fewer stones leaves, and the one with more stones gives enough stones to double the number of stones the leaving suitor had.
   - If two adjacent suitors have the same number of stones, one of them leaves and takes all the stones from the other.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a set to keep track of all possible outcomes.
   - Use a recursive function to simulate all possible negotiations.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: We read the number of suitors `n` and the list of stones they have from `nunta.in`.
2. **DFS Function**: We define a recursive function `dfs` that takes the current state of the suitors' stones and simulates all possible negotiations.
3. **Base Case**: If only one suitor remains, we add the number of stones he has to the `results` set.
4. **Recursive Case**: For each pair of adjacent suitors, we simulate the negotiation:
   - If the current suitor has fewer stones, he leaves, and the next suitor's stones are adjusted.
   - If the current suitor has more stones, the next suitor leaves, and the current suitor's stones are adjusted.
   - If they have the same number of stones, one leaves, and the other takes all stones.
5. **Result Extraction**: After all recursive calls, we convert the `results` set to a sorted vector.
6. **Output Writing**: We write the size of the results and the sorted values to `nunta.out`.

This corrected approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of negotiations correctly and capture all distinct outcomes efficiently.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests that the negotiation rules were not correctly implemented in the previous solution. Specifically, the rules for handling negotiations between suitors were not correctly applied. Let's re-evaluate the problem and correct the mistakes:

1. **Negotiation Rules**:
   - If two adjacent suitors have different numbers of stones, the one with fewer stones leaves, and the one with more stones gives enough stones to double the number of stones the leaving suitor had.
   - If two adjacent suitors have the same number of stones, one of them leaves and takes all the stones from the other.

To implement this correctly, we need to ensure that the negotiation rules are followed precisely. Here's the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    ifstream fin("nunta.in");
    ofstream fout("nunta.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    vector<int> stones(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> stones[i];
    }

    set<int> results;
    function<void(vector<int>)> dfs = [&](vector<int> current) {
        int size = current.size();
        if (size == 1) {
            results.insert(current[0]);
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; ++i) {
            vector<int> next = current;
            if (current[i] < current[i + 1]) {
                next[i + 1] += current[i];
                next.erase(next.begin() + i);
            } else if (current[i] > current[i + 1]) {
                next[i] += current[i + 1];
                next.erase(next.begin() + i + 1);
            } else {
                next[i] += current[i + 1];
                next.erase(next.begin() + i + 1);
            }
            dfs(next);
        }
    };

    dfs(stones);

    vector<int> resultVector(results.begin(), results.end());
    sort(resultVector.begin(), resultVector.end());

    fout << resultVector.size() << "\n";
    for (int value : resultVector) {
        fout << value << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```
