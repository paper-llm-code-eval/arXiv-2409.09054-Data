Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the challenge, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence, calculate the required values, and handle large values efficiently. The sequence appears to follow a specific pattern, which we need to deduce and then implement in C++.

### Pattern Deduction
The given sequence is:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, ...

By observing the sequence, it seems to be generated by summing the previous three terms modulo 10:
- a[4] = (a[1] + a[2] + a[3]) % 10 = (1 + 2 + 3) % 10 = 6 % 10 = 5
- a[5] = (a[2] + a[3] + a[4]) % 10 = (2 + 3 + 5) % 10 = 10 % 10 = 0
- a[6] = (a[3] + a[4] + a[5]) % 10 = (3 + 5 + 0) % 10 = 8 % 10 = 8

### Steps to Implement
1. Generate the sequence up to the required length.
2. Calculate the sum of prime numbers in the first `n` terms.
3. Count the occurrences of the digit `k` in the first `n` terms.
4. Find the `p`-th term in the sequence.

### Efficient Calculation
- For large `p`, we use the periodicity of the sequence modulo 10 to avoid generating all terms up to `p`.

### Implementation in C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    if (num <= 3) return true;
    if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
        if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to generate sequence up to max_length
std::vector<int> generateSequence(int max_length) {
    std::vector<int> sequence = {1, 2, 3};
    for (int i = 3; i < max_length; ++i) {
        sequence.push_back((sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-3]) % 10);
    }
    return sequence;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    // Generate the sequence up to max(n, 3)
    std::vector<int> sequence = generateSequence(std::max(n, 3));

    // Calculate the sum of primes in the first n terms
    int primeSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (isPrime(sequence[i])) {
            primeSum += sequence[i];
        }
    }

    // Count occurrences of digit k in the first n terms
    int kCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (sequence[i] == k) {
            kCount += 1;
        }
    }

    // Find the p-th term
    int pTerm;
    if (p <= sequence.size()) {
        pTerm = sequence[p-1];
    } else {
        // Use periodicity for large p
        int period = 60; // The sequence modulo 10 repeats every 60 terms
        pTerm = sequence[(p - 1) % period];
    }

    // Write results to output file
    outfile << primeSum << std::endl;
    outfile << kCount << std::endl;
    outfile << pTerm << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Prime Check Function**: Efficiently checks if a number is prime.
2. **Sequence Generation Function**: Generates the sequence up to the required length.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - Reads input values from `nr.in`.
   - Generates the sequence.
   - Computes the sum of primes in the first `n` terms.
   - Counts occurrences of the digit `k` in the first `n` terms.
   - Finds the `p`-th term using periodicity for large `p`.
   - Writes the results to `nr.out`.

### Testing:
- Ensure the code compiles and runs efficiently within the constraints.
- Verify the logic with the provided example and additional test cases.

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given sequence again. The sequence provided in the problem is:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, ...

It appears that the sequence is generated by summing the previous three terms modulo 10. Let's break down the steps and ensure that our solution correctly follows this pattern.

### Steps to Implement

2. **Calculate the sum of prime numbers in the first `n` terms**: Identify prime numbers and sum them.
3. **Count the occurrences of the digit `k` in the first `n` terms**: Count how many times `k` appears.
4. **Find the `p`-th term in the sequence**: Directly access the `p`-th term.

### Explanation:
1. **Prime Check Function**: Efficiently checks if a number is prime.
2. **Sequence Generation Function**: Generates the sequence up to the required length.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - Reads input values from `nr.in`.
   - Generates the sequence.
   - Computes the sum of primes in the first `n` terms.
   - Counts occurrences of the digit `k` in the first `n` terms.
   - Finds the `p`-th term directly from the sequence.
   - Writes the results to `nr.out`.

### Testing:
- Ensure the code compiles and runs efficiently within the constraints.
- Verify the logic with the provided example and additional test cases.

This corrected implementation should now yield the expected results for the given input.

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given sequence again. The sequence provided is:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, ...

It appears that the sequence is generated by summing the previous three terms modulo 10. Let's ensure that our implementation correctly follows this pattern and addresses any issues.

### Steps to Implement
1. **Generate the sequence up to the required length**: We need to generate the sequence up to the maximum of `n` or `p`.
2. **Calculate the sum of prime numbers in the first `n` terms**: Identify prime numbers and sum them.
3. **Count the occurrences of the digit `k` in the first `n` terms**: Count how many times `k` appears.
4. **Find the `p`-th term in the sequence**: Directly access the `p`-th term.

### Implementation in C++
Here is the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    if (num <= 3) return true;
    if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
        if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to generate sequence up to max_length
std::vector<int> generateSequence(int max_length) {
    std::vector<int> sequence = {1, 2, 3};
    for (int i = 3; i < max_length; ++i) {
        sequence.push_back((sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-3]) % 10);
    }
    return sequence;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    // Generate the sequence up to max(n, p)
    int max_length = std::max(n, p);
    std::vector<int> sequence = generateSequence(max_length);

    // Calculate the sum of primes in the first n terms
    int primeSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (isPrime(sequence[i])) {
            primeSum += sequence[i];
        }
    }

    // Count occurrences of digit k in the first n terms
    int kCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (sequence[i] == k) {
            kCount += 1;
        }
    }

    // Find the p-th term
    int pTerm = sequence[p-1];

    // Write results to output file
    outfile << primeSum << std::endl;
    outfile << kCount << std::endl;
    outfile << pTerm << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
