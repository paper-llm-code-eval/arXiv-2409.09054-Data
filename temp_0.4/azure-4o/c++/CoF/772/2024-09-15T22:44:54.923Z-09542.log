### Explanation:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence starts with a predefined set of 17 numbers.
   - If `n` is greater than 17, the sequence is extended by calculating each new term as the sum of the last three terms modulo 10.

2. **Prime Check**:
   - A helper function `is_prime` is used to check if a number is prime.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads `n`, `k`, and `p` from `nr.in`.
   - It generates the sequence up to the maximum of `n` and `p` terms.
   - It calculates the sum of prime numbers in the first `n` terms.
   - It counts the occurrences of the digit `k` in the first `n` terms.
   - It retrieves the `p`-th term in the sequence.
   - Finally, it writes the results to `nr.out`.

This solution ensures efficiency by generating the sequence only once and then performing the required calculations.

Let's evaluate the differences between the expected and found results:

1. **Prime Sum Difference**:
   - Expected: 47
   - Found: 42

2. **Count of Digit `k` Difference**:
   - Expected: 3
   - Found: 2

3. **p-th Term**:
   - Both are correct: 8

### Analysis:
1. **Prime Sum**:
   - The discrepancy in the prime sum suggests that either the sequence generated is incorrect or the prime-checking function has a bug.

2. **Count of Digit `k`**:
   - The difference in the count of digit `k` suggests that either the sequence generated is incorrect or the counting logic has a bug.

### Fixes:
- **Sequence Generation**:
  - Ensure the sequence generation logic correctly follows the pattern described.
  
- **Prime Check**:
  - Ensure the prime-checking function is accurate.

### Revised Solution:
Let's reimplement the solution with careful attention to the sequence generation and prime-checking logic.

        }
    }

    // Get the p-th term in the sequence
    int p_term = sequence[p - 1];

    // Write the results to the output file
    outfile << prime_sum << "\n" << k_count << "\n" << p_term << "\n";

    infile.close();

Given the discrepancies in the output, it's clear that there is an issue with either the sequence generation or the prime-checking logic. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence starts with a predefined set of 17 numbers.
   - For terms beyond the 17th, each new term is the sum of the last three terms modulo 10.

2. **Prime Check**:
   - We need to ensure that the prime-checking function correctly identifies prime numbers.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - We need to count the occurrences of a specific digit `k` in the first `n` terms.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Prime Sum**:
   - The prime-checking function might be incorrect or the sequence generation might be wrong.

2. **Count of Digit `k`**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `k` might be flawed.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - Ensure the sequence generation strictly follows the pattern.

2. **Prime Check**:
   - Use a reliable prime-checking function.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - Ensure the counting logic is correct.

### Revised Solution:
Let's reimplement the solution with careful attention to the sequence generation and prime-checking logic.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Function to generate the sequence up to the n-th term
std::vector<int> generate_sequence(int n) {
    std::vector<int> sequence = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4};
    if (n <= sequence.size()) {
        sequence.resize(n);
        return sequence;
    }
    for (int i = sequence.size(); i < n; ++i) {
        int next_term = (sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-3]) % 10;
        sequence.push_back(next_term);
    }
    return sequence;
}

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool is_prime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    if (num == 2 || num == 3) return true;
    if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
        if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("nr.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("nr.out");

    int n, k, p;
    infile >> n >> k >> p;

    // Generate the sequence up to the max(n, p) term
    std::vector<int> sequence = generate_sequence(std::max(n, p));

    // Calculate the sum of prime numbers in the first n terms
    int prime_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (is_prime(sequence[i])) {
            prime_sum += sequence[i];
        }
    }

    // Count the occurrences of digit k in the first n terms
    int k_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (sequence[i] == k) {
            ++k_count;
        }
    }

    // Get the p-th term in the sequence
    int p_term = sequence[p - 1];

    // Write the results to the output file
    outfile << prime_sum << "\n" << k_count << "\n" << p_term << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence starts with a predefined set of 17 numbers.
   - If `n` is greater than 17, the sequence is extended by calculating each new term as the sum of the last three terms modulo 10.

2. **Prime Check**:
   - A helper function `is_prime` is used to check if a number is prime.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads `n`, `k`, and `p` from `nr.in`.
   - It generates the sequence up to the maximum of `n` and `p` terms.
   - It calculates the sum of prime numbers in the first `n` terms.
   - It counts the occurrences of the digit `k` in the first `n` terms.
   - It retrieves the `p`-th term in the sequence.
   - Finally, it writes the results to `nr.out`.

This solution ensures efficiency by generating the sequence only once and then performing the required calculations.
