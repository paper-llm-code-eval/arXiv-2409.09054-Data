La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

struct Participant {

        pq.pop();
        outFile << current.county << " " << current.id << "\n";
        if (!countyParticipants[current.county].empty()) {

            countyParticipants[current.county].erase(countyParticipants[current.county].begin());
        }
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads the input data from `concurs.in`, processes it to ensure that participants are listed in a way that meets the specified conditions, and writes the output to `concurs.out`.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `concurs.in`. The number of participants `P` is read first, followed by the county and participant IDs for each participant.
2. **Organizing Data**: The participants are stored in a map where each key is a county identifier, and the value is a vector of participant IDs from that county.
3. **Output Number of Counties**: The number of unique counties (`NJ`) is written to the output file.
4. **Output Number of Participants per County**: The sizes of the participant vectors for each county are collected, sorted, and written to the output file.
5. **Creating the List**: A priority queue (min-heap) is used to ensure that participants are listed in the required order. The participants from each county are sorted, and the smallest participant ID from each county is pushed into the priority queue. The queue is then processed to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county, and the participants are listed in ascending order of their IDs within each county.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the requirements of the problem.

The issue with the initial implementation lies in the way the participants are outputted. The priority queue approach does not ensure that participants from the same county are separated by participants from different counties. Instead, we need to interleave participants from different counties correctly.

To achieve the desired result, we can use a round-robin approach to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;
    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // For min-heap priority queue
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream inFile("concurs.in");
    std::ofstream outFile("concurs.out");

    int P;
    inFile >> P;

    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> countyParticipants;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        inFile >> J >> E;
        countyParticipants[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        std::sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    int NJ = countyParticipants.size();
    outFile << NJ << "\n";

    std::vector<int> countySizes;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countySizes.push_back(entry.second.size());
    }
    std::sort(countySizes.begin(), countySizes.end());

    for (int size : countySizes) {
        outFile << size << " ";
    }
    outFile << "\n";

    // Create a vector of iterators to iterate through each county's participants
    std::vector<std::pair<int, std::vector<int>::iterator>> iterators;
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        iterators.push_back({entry.first, entry.second.begin()});
    }

    // Use a round-robin approach to ensure no two consecutive participants are from the same county
    while (!iterators.empty()) {
        for (auto it = iterators.begin(); it != iterators.end();) {
            outFile << it->first << " " << *(it->second) << "\n";
            ++(it->second);
            if (it->second == countyParticipants[it->first].end()) {
                it = iterators.erase(it);
            } else {
                ++it;
            }
        }
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

The issue with the previous implementation lies in the round-robin approach, which does not correctly ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. We need to ensure that the participants are interleaved correctly while maintaining the order within each county.

To achieve this, we can use a different approach by leveraging a priority queue to always pick the next participant from the county that hasn't been picked recently. This will ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county.

Here is the corrected solution:

    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {

    std::sort(countySizes.begin(), countySizes.end());

    for (int size : countySizes) {
        outFile << size << " ";
    }
    outFile << "\n";

    // Priority queue to manage the next participant from each county
    auto cmp = [](const Participant& a, const Participant& b) {
        return a.id > b.id;
    };
    std::priority_queue<Participant, std::vector<Participant>, decltype(cmp)> pq(cmp);

    // Initialize the priority queue with the first participant from each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {

The issue with the previous implementation is that it does not ensure the correct interleaving of participants from different counties. Specifically, the priority queue approach does not handle the scenario where we need to skip a participant from the same county as the last one used.

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {

    }

    // Sort participants within each county

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `concurs.in`. The number of participants `P` is read first, followed by the county and participant IDs for each participant.
2. **Organizing Data**: The participants are stored in a map where each key is a county identifier, and the value is a vector of participant IDs from that county.
3. **Sorting Participants**: The participants within each county are sorted in ascending order.
4. **Output Number of Counties**: The number of unique counties (`NJ`) is written to the output file.
5. **Output Number of Participants per County**: The sizes of the participant vectors for each county are collected, sorted, and written to the output file.
6. **Creating the List**: A priority queue is used to manage the next participant from each county. The priority queue ensures that participants are picked in ascending order of their IDs. The last used county is tracked to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. If no valid participant is found, the last used county is reset to force a pick.

This approach ensures that the solution is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

The issue with the previous implementation lies in the fact that it does not correctly enforce the interleaving of participants from different counties. The priority queue approach does not handle the scenario where we need to skip a participant from the same county as the last one used.

To address this, we need to ensure that the participants are interleaved correctly while maintaining the order within each county. We can use a round-robin approach with a queue to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream inFile("concurs.in");
    std::ofstream outFile("concurs.out");

    int P;
    inFile >> P;

    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> countyParticipants;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        inFile >> J >> E;
        countyParticipants[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        std::sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    int NJ = countyParticipants.size();
    outFile << NJ << "\n";

    std::vector<int> countySizes;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countySizes.push_back(entry.second.size());
    }
    std::sort(countySizes.begin(), countySizes.end());

    for (int size : countySizes) {
        outFile << size << " ";
    }
    outFile << "\n";

    // Create a queue of iterators to iterate through each county's participants
    std::queue<std::pair<int, std::vector<int>::iterator>> iterators;
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        iterators.push({entry.first, entry.second.begin()});
    }

    // Use a round-robin approach to ensure no two consecutive participants are from the same county
    while (!iterators.empty()) {
        int n = iterators.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            auto current = iterators.front();
            iterators.pop();

            outFile << current.first << " " << *(current.second) << "\n";
            ++(current.second);

            if (current.second != countyParticipants[current.first].end()) {
                iterators.push(current);
            }
        }
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    return 0;
}
```
