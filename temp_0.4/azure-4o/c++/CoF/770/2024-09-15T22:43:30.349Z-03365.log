La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of participants `P` and then reads each participant's county `J` and ID `E`, storing them in a map where the key is the county ID and the value is a vector of `Participant` structs.

2. **Sorting Participants**: For each county, the participants are sorted by their ID.

3. **Writing Output**:
   - The number of unique counties `NJ` is determined by the size of the set `counties`.
   - The number of participants per county is written in the order of county IDs.
   
4. **Creating the Required List**:
   - The program iterates through the map, appending participants to the result list in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that consecutive participants are from different counties.
   - Once a county's participant list is exhausted, it is removed from the map.

5. **Outputting the Result List**: Finally, the program writes the ordered list of participants to the output file.

This solution ensures the constraints are met and the operations are efficient, given the problem constraints.

The initial solution had a logical flaw in the way it constructed the final list of participants. Specifically, it was popping participants from the back of the list, which resulted in the order being reversed.

Let's fix this by ensuring that we always take participants from the front of the list and maintain the correct order. Additionally, we need to ensure that the participants are added in a round-robin fashion to meet the requirement that consecutive participants are from different counties.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;

    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id < other.id;
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("concurs.in");
    ofstream outFile("concurs.out");

    int P;
    inFile >> P;

    map<int, vector<Participant>> countyMap;
    set<int> counties;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        inFile >> J >> E;
        countyMap[J].push_back({J, E});
        counties.insert(J);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyMap) {
        sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Write number of counties
    int NJ = counties.size();
    outFile << NJ << endl;

    // Write number of participants per county in sorted order of counties
    for (int county : counties) {
        outFile << countyMap[county].size() << " ";
    }
    outFile << endl;

    // Create the required list
    vector<Participant> resultList;
    queue<int> countyQueue;
    for (int county : counties) {
        countyQueue.push(county);
    }

    while (!countyQueue.empty()) {
        int currentCounty = countyQueue.front();
        countyQueue.pop();

        if (!countyMap[currentCounty].empty()) {
            resultList.push_back(countyMap[currentCounty].front());
            countyMap[currentCounty].erase(countyMap[currentCounty].begin());

            if (!countyMap[currentCounty].empty()) {
                countyQueue.push(currentCounty);
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the result list
    for (const auto& participant : resultList) {
        outFile << participant.county << " " << participant.id << endl;
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:

1. **Reading Input**: The input reading part remains the same.

2. **Sorting Participants**: Participants within each county are sorted by their ID.

3. **Writing Output**:
   - The number of unique counties `NJ` is determined and written.
   - The number of participants per county is written in the order of county IDs.

4. **Creating the Required List**:
   - A queue `countyQueue` is used to manage the round-robin order of counties.
   - Participants are taken from the front of each county's list, ensuring the correct order.
   - Counties are re-added to the queue if they still have participants left.

5. **Outputting the Result List**: The final list of participants is written to the output file in the correct order.

This solution ensures that the participants are listed in the correct order and that consecutive participants are from different counties.

The error message indicates that the `set` header was not included, which caused the compiler to not recognize the `set` type. Let's fix this by including the `<set>` header. Additionally, let's ensure all necessary headers are included and the code is correctly structured.

Here is the corrected and complete solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;

    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id < other.id;
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("concurs.in");
    ofstream outFile("concurs.out");

    int P;
    inFile >> P;

    map<int, vector<Participant>> countyMap;
    set<int> counties;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        inFile >> J >> E;
        countyMap[J].push_back({J, E});
        counties.insert(J);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyMap) {
        sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Write number of counties
    int NJ = counties.size();
    outFile << NJ << endl;

    // Write number of participants per county in sorted order of counties
    for (int county : counties) {
        outFile << countyMap[county].size() << " ";
    }
    outFile << endl;

    // Create the required list
    vector<Participant> resultList;
    queue<int> countyQueue;
    for (int county : counties) {
        countyQueue.push(county);
    }

    while (!countyQueue.empty()) {
        int currentCounty = countyQueue.front();
        countyQueue.pop();

        if (!countyMap[currentCounty].empty()) {
            resultList.push_back(countyMap[currentCounty].front());
            countyMap[currentCounty].erase(countyMap[currentCounty].begin());

            if (!countyMap[currentCounty].empty()) {
                countyQueue.push(currentCounty);
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the result list
    for (const auto& participant : resultList) {
        outFile << participant.county << " " << participant.id << endl;
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:

1. **Include Necessary Headers**: Added the missing `#include <set>` to ensure the `set` type is recognized by the compiler.

2. **Reading Input**: The input reading part remains the same.

3. **Sorting Participants**: Participants within each county are sorted by their ID.

4. **Writing Output**:
   - The number of unique counties `NJ` is determined and written.
   - The number of participants per county is written in the order of county IDs.

5. **Creating the Required List**:
   - A queue `countyQueue` is used to manage the round-robin order of counties.
   - Participants are taken from the front of each county's list, ensuring the correct order.
   - Counties are re-added to the queue if they still have participants left.

The issue with the previous solution is that it did not ensure that two consecutive participants are from different counties. To fix this, we need to implement a more careful round-robin scheduling that ensures the required condition.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system, often due to excessive memory usage or running out of memory. This might happen if the program enters an infinite loop or if it uses too much memory.

Given the nature of the problem, it's unlikely that we are running out of memory with the constraints provided. Therefore, the issue might be related to the logic used to manage the round-robin scheduling, possibly causing an infinite loop.

Let's simplify and correct the logic to ensure that we correctly alternate between counties without causing an infinite loop. We can use a more straightforward approach with a queue to manage the round-robin scheduling.

Here is the corrected solution:

2. **Sorting Participants**: Participants within each county are sorted by their ID.

3. **Writing Output**:
   - The number of unique counties `NJ` is determined and written.
   - The number of participants per county is written in the order of county IDs.

4. **Creating the Required List**:
   - A queue `countyQueue` is used to manage the round-robin order of counties.
   - Participants are taken from the front of each county's list, ensuring the correct order.
   - Counties are re-added to the queue if they still have participants left.

5. **Outputting the Result List**: The final list of participants is written to the output file in the correct order.

This solution ensures that the participants are listed in the correct order and that consecutive participants are from different counties. The use of a queue ensures that we maintain the round-robin scheduling without causing an infinite loop.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not ensure that consecutive participants are from different counties. To fix this, we need a more careful round-robin scheduling that ensures the required condition.

Let's implement a solution that uses a priority queue to always pick the next participant from a different county than the last one. This approach ensures that the participants are listed in the correct order and that consecutive participants are from different counties.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;

    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // Reverse order for min-heap
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("concurs.in");
    ofstream outFile("concurs.out");

    int P;
    inFile >> P;

    map<int, vector<Participant>> countyMap;
    set<int> counties;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        inFile >> J >> E;
        countyMap[J].push_back({J, E});
        counties.insert(J);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyMap) {
        sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Write number of counties
    int NJ = counties.size();
    outFile << NJ << endl;

    // Write number of participants per county in sorted order of counties
    for (int county : counties) {
        outFile << countyMap[county].size() << " ";
    }
    outFile << endl;

    // Create the required list
    vector<Participant> resultList;
    priority_queue<Participant> pq;
    for (int county : counties) {
        if (!countyMap[county].empty()) {
            pq.push(countyMap[county].front());
            countyMap[county].erase(countyMap[county].begin());
        }
    }

    int lastCounty = -1;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Participant current = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        if (current.county != lastCounty) {
            resultList.push_back(current);
            lastCounty = current.county;

            if (!countyMap[current.county].empty()) {
                pq.push(countyMap[current.county].front());
                countyMap[current.county].erase(countyMap[current.county].begin());
            }
        } else {
            vector<Participant> temp;
            while (!pq.empty() && pq.top().county == lastCounty) {
                temp.push_back(pq.top());
                pq.pop();
            }

            if (!pq.empty()) {
                Participant next = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                resultList.push_back(next);
                lastCounty = next.county;

                if (!countyMap[next.county].empty()) {
                    pq.push(countyMap[next.county].front());
                    countyMap[next.county].erase(countyMap[next.county].begin());
                }
            }

            for (auto& item : temp) {
                pq.push(item);
            }
            pq.push(current);
        }
    }

    // Write the result list
    for (const auto& participant : resultList) {
        outFile << participant.county << " " << participant.id << endl;
    }

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

   - Participants are taken from the front of each county's list, ensuring the correct order.
   - If the next participant is from the same county as the last one, we temporarily store them and continue to the next available county.
   - This ensures that consecutive participants are from different counties.

5. **Outputting the Result List**: The final list of participants is written to the output file in the correct order.

This solution ensures that the participants are listed in the correct order and that consecutive participants are from different counties. The use of a priority queue ensures that we always pick the next participant with the smallest ID from a different county.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system, often due to excessive memory usage or running out of memory. This might happen if the program enters an infinite loop or if it uses too much memory.

Given that the constraints are not very high, the issue is likely due to a logical error causing an infinite loop or excessive memory usage. The previous approach, while logically sound, might have an issue with how it handles the priority queue and the temporary storage of participants.

Let's reimplement the solution using a simpler approach to ensure that we alternate participants from different counties without causing an infinite loop or excessive memory usage.

Here is the corrected solution:

    int id;

    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // Reverse order for min-heap
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("concurs.in");
    ofstream outFile("concurs.out");

    int P;
    inFile >> P;

    map<int, vector<Participant>> countyMap;
    set<int> counties;

    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        inFile >> J >> E;
        countyMap[J].push_back({J, E});
        counties.insert(J);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyMap) {
        sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Write number of counties
    int NJ = counties.size();
    outFile << NJ << endl;

    // Write number of participants per county in sorted order of counties
    for (int county : counties) {
        outFile << countyMap[county].size() << " ";
    }
    outFile << endl;

    // Create the required list
    vector<Participant> resultList;
    queue<int> countyQueue;
    for (int county : counties) {
        if (!countyMap[county].empty()) {
            countyQueue.push(county);
        }
    }

    int lastCounty = -1;
    while (!countyQueue.empty()) {
        int currentCounty = countyQueue.front();
        countyQueue.pop();

        if (currentCounty != lastCounty) {
            resultList.push_back(countyMap[currentCounty].front());
            countyMap[currentCounty].erase(countyMap[currentCounty].begin());
            lastCounty = currentCounty;

            if (!countyMap[currentCounty].empty()) {
                countyQueue.push(currentCounty);
            }
        } else {
            countyQueue.push(currentCounty);
            int nextCounty = countyQueue.front();
            countyQueue.pop();
            resultList.push_back(countyMap[nextCounty].front());
            countyMap[nextCounty].erase(countyMap[nextCounty].begin());
            lastCounty = nextCounty;

            if (!countyMap[nextCounty].empty()) {
                countyQueue.push(nextCounty);
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the result list
    for (const auto& participant : resultList) {
        outFile << participant.county << " " << participant.id << endl;
