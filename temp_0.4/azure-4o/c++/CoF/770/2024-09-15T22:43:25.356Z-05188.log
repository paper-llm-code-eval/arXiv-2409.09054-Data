La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of participants and then read each participant's county and ID, storing them in a map where the key is the county and the value is a vector of IDs.
2. **Sorting IDs**: For each county, we sort the IDs in ascending order.
3. **Output Number of Counties and Sizes**: We count the number of counties and output it. Then we output the sizes of the vectors (number of participants) for each county in ascending order.
4. **Interleaving Participants**: We use a priority queue to interleave participants from different counties. By pushing the smallest ID from each county initially and then maintaining the order by always pushing the next smallest ID from the same county after popping, we ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. 

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the requirements of the problem.

The discrepancy in the output is due to the incorrect order of the county sizes in the output. The county sizes should be sorted based on the county identifiers, not the sizes themselves. Let's fix this issue by ensuring that the county sizes are output in the order of the county identifiers.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;
    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // For priority queue to work as min-heap
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    std::ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;
    
    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> countyParticipants;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        fin >> J >> E;
        countyParticipants[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        std::sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Prepare output
    int NJ = countyParticipants.size();
    fout << NJ << "\n";
    
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> countySizes;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countySizes.push_back({entry.first, entry.second.size()});
    }
    std::sort(countySizes.begin(), countySizes.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < NJ; ++i) {
        fout << countySizes[i].second;
        if (i != NJ - 1) fout << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    // Use a priority queue to interleave participants from different counties
    std::priority_queue<Participant> pq;
    std::map<int, int> countyIndex;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        pq.push({entry.first, entry.second[0]});
        countyIndex[entry.first] = 1;
    }

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Participant p = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        fout << p.county << " " << p.id << "\n";
        if (countyIndex[p.county] < countyParticipants[p.county].size()) {
            pq.push({p.county, countyParticipants[p.county][countyIndex[p.county]]});
            countyIndex[p.county]++;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as before, and participants are stored in a map where the key is the county and the value is a vector of IDs.
2. **Sorting IDs**: IDs within each county are sorted in ascending order.
3. **Output Number of Counties and Sizes**: The number of counties is output first. Then, instead of sorting the sizes, we sort the county identifiers and output sizes in the order of these identifiers.
4. **Interleaving Participants**: The priority queue is used to interleave participants from different counties. We maintain the order by always pushing the next smallest ID from the same county after popping, ensuring that no two consecutive participants are from the same county.

The discrepancy in the output is due to the incorrect interleaving of participants from different counties. Specifically, the solution needs to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. The priority queue approach needs to be adjusted to handle this correctly.

The main issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly interleave participants from different counties. The priority queue approach needs to be adjusted to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the last county is the same as the current county correctly.

Let's reimplement the solution using a different approach. Instead of using a priority queue, we can use a round-robin approach where we iterate over the counties and pick participants in a cyclic manner.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <queue>

        fin >> J >> E;
        countyParticipants[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        std::sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Prepare output
    int NJ = countyParticipants.size();
    fout << NJ << "\n";
    
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> countySizes;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countySizes.push_back({entry.first, entry.second.size()});
    }
    std::sort(countySizes.begin(), countySizes.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < NJ; ++i) {
        fout << countySizes[i].second;
        if (i != NJ - 1) fout << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    // Prepare the round-robin structure
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> roundRobin;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        for (int id : entry.second) {
            roundRobin.push_back({entry.first, id});
        }
    }

    // Sort the round-robin structure based on county first, then id
    std::sort(roundRobin.begin(), roundRobin.end());

    // Output the participants in round-robin order ensuring no two consecutive participants are from the same county
    std::vector<int> indices(NJ, 0);
    std::vector<int> countyOrder(NJ);
    int index = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countyOrder[index++] = entry.first;
    }

    int lastCounty = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < NJ; ++j) {
            int county = countyOrder[j];
            if (indices[j] < countyParticipants[county].size() && county != lastCounty) {
                fout << county << " " << countyParticipants[county][indices[j]] << "\n";
                indices[j]++;
                lastCounty = county;
                break;
            }
        }

The previous solution did not correctly interleave participants from different counties, resulting in consecutive participants from the same county in some cases. To fix this, we need to ensure that the interleaving is done correctly by using a more structured approach.

We will use a priority queue to manage the interleaving process better. The priority queue will help us always pick the smallest available participant from a different county than the last one added to the list.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;
    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // For priority queue to work as min-heap
    }
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    std::ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;
    
    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> countyParticipants;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        fin >> J >> E;
        countyParticipants[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        std::sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Prepare output
    int NJ = countyParticipants.size();
    fout << NJ << "\n";
    
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> countySizes;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countySizes.push_back({entry.first, entry.second.size()});
    }
    std::sort(countySizes.begin(), countySizes.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < NJ; ++i) {
        fout << countySizes[i].second;
        if (i != NJ - 1) fout << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    // Use a priority queue to interleave participants from different counties
    std::priority_queue<Participant> pq;
    std::map<int, int> countyIndex;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        pq.push({entry.first, entry.second[0]});
        countyIndex[entry.first] = 1;
    }

    int lastCounty = -1;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Participant p = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        if (p.county == lastCounty && !pq.empty()) {
            Participant next = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            fout << next.county << " " << next.id << "\n";
            lastCounty = next.county;
            if (countyIndex[next.county] < countyParticipants[next.county].size()) {
                pq.push({next.county, countyParticipants[next.county][countyIndex[next.county]]});
                countyIndex[next.county]++;
            }
            pq.push(p);
        } else {

                countyIndex[p.county]++;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as before, and participants are stored in a map where the key is the county and the value is a vector of IDs.
2. **Sorting IDs**: IDs within each county are sorted in ascending order.
3. **Output Number of Counties and Sizes**: The number of counties is output first. Then, instead of sorting the sizes, we sort the county identifiers and output sizes in the order of these identifiers.
4. **Interleaving Participants**: The priority queue is used to interleave participants from different counties. We maintain the order by always pushing the next smallest ID from the same county after popping, ensuring that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. If the next participant in the priority queue is from the same county as the last one output, we temporarily pop it and push the next participant.

This approach ensures that the solution is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

The main issue with the previous solutions is that they do not correctly interleave participants from different counties. The priority queue approach needs to be adjusted to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the last county is the same as the current county correctly.

Let's reimplement the solution using a different approach. Instead of using a priority queue, we can use a round-robin approach where we iterate over the counties and pick participants in a cyclic manner.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    std::ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;
    
    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> countyParticipants;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        fin >> J >> E;
        countyParticipants[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort participants within each county
    for (auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        std::sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Prepare output
    int NJ = countyParticipants.size();
    fout << NJ << "\n";
    
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> countySizes;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countySizes.push_back({entry.first, entry.second.size()});
    }
    std::sort(countySizes.begin(), countySizes.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < NJ; ++i) {
        fout << countySizes[i].second;
        if (i != NJ - 1) fout << " ";
    }
    fout << "\n";

    // Prepare the round-robin structure
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> roundRobin;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        for (int id : entry.second) {
            roundRobin.push_back({entry.first, id});
        }
    }

    // Sort the round-robin structure based on county first, then id
    std::sort(roundRobin.begin(), roundRobin.end());

    // Output the participants in round-robin order ensuring no two consecutive participants are from the same county
    std::vector<int> indices(NJ, 0);
    std::vector<int> countyOrder(NJ);
    int index = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : countyParticipants) {
        countyOrder[index++] = entry.first;
    }

    int lastCounty = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < NJ; ++j) {
            int county = countyOrder[j];
            if (indices[j] < countyParticipants[county].size() && county != lastCounty) {
                fout << county << " " << countyParticipants[county][indices[j]] << "\n";
                indices[j]++;
                lastCounty = county;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
