La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `concurs.in` using file streams. The number of participants `P` is read first, followed by pairs of integers representing the county identifier `J` and the student identifier `E`.

2. **Organizing Data**: A map `county_map` is used to store the student identifiers for each county. The keys of the map are the county identifiers, and the values are vectors containing the student identifiers.

3. **Sorting**: For each county, the list of student identifiers is sorted in ascending order.

4. **Priority Queue**: A priority queue (min-heap) is used to manage the participants. Initially, the smallest student identifier from each county is pushed into the priority queue.

5. **Output**:
   - The number of counties is written to `concurs.out`.
   - The number of participants from each county is written in ascending order of county identifiers.
   - The participants are then written in the required order, ensuring that no two consecutive participants are from the same county.

6. **Generating the List**: The priority queue is used to maintain the order of participants. Each time a participant is taken from the queue, the next participant from the same county is pushed into the queue, ensuring the order and the alternating counties requirement.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the problem requirements.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results lies in the order of the participants in the final list. The solution needs to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county, and the participants from each county appear in ascending order of their identifiers.

The issue in the previous solution was that it didn't properly ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. To fix this, we need to use a different approach to manage the alternation of counties while maintaining the order of participant identifiers.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Participant {
    int county;

        return id > other.id; // for min-heap
    }
};

int main() {

    int P;
    fin >> P;

    map<int, vector<int>> county_map;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        fin >> J >> E;
        county_map[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort each county's participants by their ids
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {
        sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Create a priority queue to manage the participants
    priority_queue<Participant> pq;
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {
        pq.push({entry.first, entry.second[0]});
        entry.second.erase(entry.second.begin());
    }

    // Output the number of counties
    fout << county_map.size() << endl;

    // Output the number of participants from each county in sorted order of county ids
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {

    int last_county = -1;
    while (!pq.empty()) {

        bool found = false;
        while (!pq.empty()) {

            pq.pop();
            if (current.county != last_county) {
                result.push_back(current);
                last_county = current.county;
                if (!county_map[current.county].empty()) {
                    pq.push({current.county, county_map[current.county][0]});
                    county_map[current.county].erase(county_map[current.county].begin());
                }
                found = true;
                break;
            } else {

The previous solution failed to handle the alternation of counties correctly, leading to an incomplete output. To ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county and that all participants are included, we need to use a round-robin approach with a priority queue to manage the participants.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp

};

int main() {

    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;

The previous implementation still has issues with ensuring that all participants are included in the final output. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the last participant from a county is not added correctly due to the alternation requirement.

To fix this, we need to ensure that every participant is included while maintaining the alternation of counties. We can achieve this by using a round-robin approach where we cycle through the counties and add participants one by one.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp

#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Participant {
    int county;

    map<int, vector<int>> county_map;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        fin >> J >> E;
        county_map[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort each county's participants by their ids
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {
        sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Output the number of counties
    fout << county_map.size() << endl;

    // Output the number of participants from each county in sorted order of county ids
    vector<pair<int, int>> county_sizes;
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {
        county_sizes.push_back({entry.first, entry.second.size()});
    }
    sort(county_sizes.begin(), county_sizes.end());
    for (auto& entry : county_sizes) {
        fout << entry.second << " ";
    }
    fout << endl;

    // Generate the required list
    vector<Participant> result;
    vector<queue<int>> county_queues(51); // 51 to accommodate county ids from 1 to 50
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {
        for (int id : entry.second) {
            county_queues[entry.first].push(id);
        }
    }

    int last_county = -1;
    while (result.size() < P) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
            if (!county_queues[i].empty() && i != last_county) {
                result.push_back({i, county_queues[i].front()});
                county_queues[i].pop();
                last_county = i;

    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

5. **Generating the List**: 
   - We use a vector of queues `county_queues` to store the participants of each county. Each queue will hold the sorted participants of a county.
   - We then use a round-robin approach to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county. We cycle through the counties and add the next participant from each county to the result list, ensuring the alternation requirement is met.
   - The `last_county` variable is used to track the last county added to the result list, ensuring that the next participant is from a different county.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the problem requirements.

The previous solution did not correctly alternate participants between counties, leading to an incorrect order of participants in the output. The main issue is that the round-robin approach was not correctly implemented to ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county.

To fix this, we need to use a more structured approach to alternate between counties while maintaining the order of student identifiers. We can achieve this by using a priority queue to manage the participants from different counties and ensure that no two consecutive participants are from the same county.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;
    
    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // for min-heap
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;

### Explanation of the Fix

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `concurs.in` using file streams. The number of participants `P` is read first, followed by pairs of integers representing the county identifier `J` and the student identifier `E`.

2. **Organizing Data**: A map `county_map` is used to store the student identifiers for each county. The keys of the map are the county identifiers, and the values are vectors containing the student identifiers.

3. **Sorting**: For each county, the list of student identifiers is sorted in ascending order.

4. **Output**:
   - The number of counties is written to `concurs.out`.
   - The number of participants from each county is written in ascending order of county identifiers.

5. **Priority Queue**: A priority queue (min-heap) is used to manage the participants. Initially, the smallest student identifier from each county is pushed into the priority queue.

6. **Generating the List**: 
   - The priority queue is used to maintain the order of participants. Each time a participant is taken from the queue, the next participant from the same county is pushed into the queue, ensuring the order and the alternating counties requirement.
   - A temporary priority queue `temp_pq` is used to handle cases where the next participant is from the same county as the last one, ensuring the alternation of counties.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the problem requirements.

The previous solution still fails to ensure that all participants are included in the final output because it doesn't correctly handle the alternation and exhaustion of participants from each county. The key issue is that the algorithm doesn't properly manage the alternation when participants from a county are exhausted.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we always have a valid participant to alternate from a different county. We can achieve this by using a more structured approach with a round-robin mechanism and a priority queue to manage participants.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Participant {
    int county;
    int id;
    
    bool operator<(const Participant& other) const {
        return id > other.id; // for min-heap
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("concurs.in");
    ofstream fout("concurs.out");

    int P;
    fin >> P;

    map<int, vector<int>> county_map;
    for (int i = 0; i < P; ++i) {
        int J, E;
        fin >> J >> E;
        county_map[J].push_back(E);
    }

    // Sort each county's participants by their ids
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {
        sort(entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }

    // Output the number of counties
    fout << county_map.size() << endl;

    // Output the number of participants from each county in sorted order of county ids
    vector<pair<int, int>> county_sizes;
    for (auto& entry : county_map) {
        county_sizes.push_back({entry.first, entry.second.size()});
    }
    sort(county_sizes.begin(), county_sizes.end());
    for (auto& entry : county_sizes) {
        fout << entry.second << " ";
    }
    fout << endl;

    // Create a priority queue to manage the participants

        entry.second.erase(entry.second.begin());
    }

    // Generate the required list
    vector<Participant> result;
    int last_county = -1;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        priority_queue<Participant> temp_pq;

                result.push_back(current);
                last_county = current.county;
                if (!county_map[current.county].empty()) {
                    pq.push({current.county, county_map[current.county][0]});
                    county_map[current.county].erase(county_map[current.county].begin());
                }
                found = true;
                break;
            } else {
