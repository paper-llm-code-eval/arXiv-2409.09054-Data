Lizuca are $n$ flori ornamentale de înălțimi $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$, exprimate în centimetri. Pentru a uda plantele, Lizuca stabilește următorul program: în prima zi va alege o plantă pe care o va uda, în a doua zi va alege două plante pe care le va uda, în ziua a treia va alege trei plante pe care le va uda și așa mai departe. Dacă o plantă este udată într-o anumită zi, atunci crește $1$ centimetru până la sfârșitul acelei zile, iar dacă nu este udată, rămâne la înălțimea pe care o avea la sfârșitul zilei precedente.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină:
1. un număr natural $S$, exprimat în centimetri, reprezentând suma înălțimilor finale ale tuturor plantelor, dacă Lizuca le-ar uda după procedeul descris, timp de n zile;
2. un număr natural $K$, reprezentând numărul maxim de zile în care Lizuca poate uda florile după procedeul descris anterior, astfel ca la sfârșitul celei de a $K$-a zi, nici o plantă ornamentală să nu atingă înălțimea $H$.

# Date de intrare

Prima linie a fișierului `flori.in` conține două numere naturale $n$ și $H$, separate printr-un spațiu, având semnificația din enunț.
Linia a doua conține $n$ numere naturale: $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$ separate prin câte un singur spațiu, reprezentând înălțimile inițiale ale plantelor.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `flori.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural $S$ având semnificația descrisă în cerința $1$. A doua linie va conține un număr natural $K$, având semnificația descrisă în cerința $2$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N, H \leq 100$;
* $1 \leq h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n < H$;
* O plantă poate fi udată o singură dată pe zi.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30\%$ din punctajul total pentru fiecare test.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70\%$ din punctajul total pentru fiecare test.

```

This solution reads the input from `flori.in`, processes the data according to the problem requirements, and writes the results to `flori.out`. The algorithm sorts the heights each day to ensure that the smallest plants are watered first, and checks if watering is possible without any plant reaching or exceeding height `H`. It then updates the heights and counts the total days and final heights.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there is an issue with how the heights are being updated and counted. Specifically, the total height calculation seems to be incorrect.

Let's break down the problem and ensure that we correctly implement the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of flowers `n` and the maximum height `H`.
2. **Initial Heights**: Read the initial heights of the flowers.
3. **Watering Logic**:
   - Each day, Lizuca waters an increasing number of flowers.
   - Ensure no flower reaches or exceeds height `H` during the watering process.
4. **Calculate Total Height**: Sum the final heights of all flowers after the watering process.
5. **Determine Maximum Days**: Count the maximum number of days Lizuca can water the flowers without any reaching height `H`.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the heights are correctly updated and the total height is accurately calculated. Here is the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("flori.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    infile >> n >> H;

    std::vector<int> heights(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> heights[i];
    }

    int totalHeight = 0;
    int maxDays = 0;

    for (int day = 1; day <= n; ++day) {
        std::sort(heights.begin(), heights.end());
        
        bool canWater = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < day; ++i) {
            if (heights[i] + 1 >= H) {
                canWater = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!canWater) {
            break;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < day; ++i) {
            heights[i]++;
        }

        maxDays++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        totalHeight += heights[i];
    }

    outfile << totalHeight << "\n" << maxDays << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:

1. **Correctly Updating Heights**: Each day, the smallest `day` number of plants are watered, ensuring that the smallest plants are watered first.
2. **Checking Watering Condition**: Before watering, check if any of the selected plants would exceed height `H` if watered. If so, stop the process.
3. **Summing Final Heights**: After the watering process, sum the final heights of all plants to get the total height.

This should ensure that the program produces the correct output for the given example and other test cases within the problem constraints.

The issue with the previous implementations is that they do not correctly update the heights of the plants over multiple days. Specifically, they fail to properly account for the cumulative effect of watering the plants over several days.

To address this, we need to ensure that:
1. Each day, the correct plants are watered.
2. The heights are updated correctly and cumulatively.
3. The total height is calculated accurately after all possible watering days.

Thank you for your patience. The discrepancy in the results indicates that the heights are not being updated correctly over multiple days. Specifically, the cumulative effect of watering the plants over several days is not being accounted for properly.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure that we correctly implement the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of flowers `n` and the maximum height `H`.
2. **Initial Heights**: Read the initial heights of the flowers.
3. **Watering Logic**:
   - Each day, Lizuca waters an increasing number of flowers.
   - Ensure no flower reaches or exceeds height `H` during the watering process.
4. **Calculate Total Height**: Sum the final heights of all flowers after the watering process.
5. **Determine Maximum Days**: Count the maximum number of days Lizuca can water the flowers without any reaching height `H`.

Here is the re-implemented and corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("flori.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("flori.out");

    int n, H;
    infile >> n >> H;

    std::vector<int> heights(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> heights[i];
    }

    int totalHeight = 0;
    int maxDays = 0;
    int currentDay = 1;

    while (true) {
        std::sort(heights.begin(), heights.end());

        bool canWater = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < currentDay; ++i) {
            if (i >= n || heights[i] + 1 >= H) {
                canWater = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!canWater) {
            break;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < currentDay; ++i) {
            heights[i]++;
        }

        maxDays++;
        currentDay++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        totalHeight += heights[i];
    }

    outfile << totalHeight << "\n" << maxDays << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:

1. **Correctly Updating Heights**: Each day, the smallest `currentDay` number of plants are watered, ensuring that the smallest plants are watered first.
2. **Checking Watering Condition**: Before watering, check if any of the selected plants would exceed height `H` if watered. If so, stop the process.
3. **Summing Final Heights**: After the watering process, sum the final heights of all plants to get the total height.

This should ensure that the program produces the correct output for the given example and other test cases within the problem constraints.
