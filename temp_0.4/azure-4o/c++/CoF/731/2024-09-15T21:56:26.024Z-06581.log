Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here is the C++ solution for the given problem. This solution reads from `popas.in` and writes to `popas.out` without using `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, or `scanf()`. It uses file input and output operations to handle the data.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("popas.in");
    ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int k;
    fin >> k;

    vector<pair<int, vector<int>>> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int trail_id, r;
        fin >> trail_id >> r;
        vector<int> springs(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            fin >> springs[j];
        }
        trails[i] = {trail_id, springs};
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_trail = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int trail_id = trails[i].first;
        vector<int>& springs = trails[i].second;
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1); // Add the peak as the last point

        int stops = 0;
        int last_refill = 0;
        bool possible = true;

        for (int j = 0; j < springs.size(); ++j) {
            if (springs[j] - last_refill > t) {
                if (j == 0 || springs[j] - springs[j - 1] > u) {
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
                last_refill = springs[j - 1];
                stops++;
                if (springs[j] - last_refill > t) {
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (possible && stops <= min_stops) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_trail = trail_id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_trail;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of trails `k` is read.
   - For each trail, the trail ID and the number of springs are read, followed by the distances of the springs.
   - Finally, the values of `t` (distance for which water is sufficient) and `u` (distance that can be traveled without water) are read.

2. **Processing Each Trail:**
   - For each trail, the springs are processed to determine the minimum number of stops required to reach the peak.
   - The peak is considered to be 1 km beyond the last spring.
   - The algorithm checks if it's possible to travel the trail with the given constraints (`t` and `u`), and if so, calculates the number of stops required.

3. **Selecting the Optimal Trail:**
   - The trail with the minimum number of stops is selected.
   - If multiple trails have the same number of stops, the one that appears last in the input is chosen.

4. **Output:**
   - The result is written to `popas.out`. If no trail is feasible, `0` is written; otherwise, the minimum number of stops and the chosen trail ID are written.

This solution ensures efficient processing and correct handling of the input and output as required by the problem statement.

Let's evaluate the differences between the expected and found result. The expected output is `1 1`, meaning that the optimal trail is the first one with only 1 stop. However, the found output is `0`, indicating that no valid trail was found.

### Analysis of the Issue:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The hiker needs to reach the peak with the fewest stops to refill water.
   - The peak is always 1 km beyond the last spring.
   - The hiker can travel `t` km with a full thermos and `u` km without water.

2. **Possible Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to determine if a trail is feasible might be incorrect.
   - The calculation of stops might not be handling edge cases properly.
   - The condition to check if the hiker can travel without water (`u` km) might not be correctly implemented.

### Fixing the Solution:
We need to ensure that the logic for determining the feasibility of a trail and the calculation of stops are correctly implemented. Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("popas.in");
    ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int k;
    fin >> k;

    vector<pair<int, vector<int>>> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int trail_id, r;
        fin >> trail_id >> r;
        vector<int> springs(r);
        for (int j = 0; j < r; ++j) {
            fin >> springs[j];
        }
        trails[i] = {trail_id, springs};
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_trail = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int trail_id = trails[i].first;
        vector<int>& springs = trails[i].second;
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1); // Add the peak as the last point

        int stops = 0;
        int last_refill = 0;
        bool possible = true;

        for (int j = 0; j < springs.size(); ++j) {
            if (springs[j] - last_refill > t) {
                if (j == 0 || springs[j] - springs[j - 1] > t) {
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
                last_refill = springs[j - 1];
                stops++;
                if (springs[j] - last_refill > t) {
                    possible = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (possible && stops <= min_stops) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_trail = trail_id;
        }
    }

    if (min_stops == INT_MAX) {
        fout << "0";
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_trail;
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Adding the Peak Correctly:**
   - Ensure the peak is 1 km beyond the last spring by adding `springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1);`.

2. **Checking Feasibility Properly:**
   - Ensure the distance between any two consecutive springs is within the range that can be covered with a full thermos (`t` km).
   - If the distance between the current spring and the last refill point exceeds `t`, a refill is needed at the previous spring.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure the first spring is correctly handled.
   - Ensure the logic correctly handles the transition from one spring to the next and the final push to the peak.

This should ensure that the solution correctly identifies the optimal trail with the minimum number of stops.

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Adding the Peak Correctly:**
   - Ensure the peak is 1 km beyond the last spring by adding `springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1);`.

2. **Checking Feasibility Properly:**
   - Ensure the distance between any two consecutive springs is within the range that can be covered with a full thermos (`t` km).
   - If the distance between the current spring and the last refill point exceeds `t`, a refill is needed at the previous spring.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure the first spring is correctly handled.
   - Ensure the logic correctly handles the transition from one spring to the next and the final push to the peak.

This should ensure that the solution correctly identifies the optimal trail with the minimum number of stops.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the issues more thoroughly. The previous attempts have not correctly addressed the problem requirements. 

### Problem Recap:
1. The hiker needs to reach the peak with the fewest stops to refill water.
2. The peak is always 1 km beyond the last spring.
3. The hiker can travel `t` km with a full thermos and `u` km without water.

### Key Points:
1. We need to ensure the hiker can travel from one spring to the next within the constraints.
2. If the distance between two springs exceeds `t`, the hiker must refill at the previous spring.
3. The solution must handle edge cases and ensure correct calculation of stops.

### Revised Plan:
1. **Read Input:**
   - Read the number of trails `k`.
   - For each trail, read the trail ID, number of springs, and the distances of the springs.
   - Read the values of `t` and `u`.

2. **Process Each Trail:**
   - For each trail, determine the minimum number of stops required to reach the peak.
   - Use a greedy approach to determine the feasibility and the number of stops.

3. **Select Optimal Trail:**
   - Track the trail with the minimum number of stops.
   - If multiple trails have the same minimum stops, choose the one that appears last in the input.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Write the result to `popas.out`.
