Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Read Input Data**: We need to read the number of trails and the details of each trail, including the number of springs and their distances. Additionally, we need to read the distance `t` that the water in the thermos lasts and the maximum distance `u` the hiker can travel without water.

2. **Process Each Trail**: For each trail, we need to determine the minimum number of stops required to refill the thermos. This can be done using a greedy approach where we always refill at the farthest spring within our current reach.

3. **Determine the Best Trail**: Among all trails, we need to find the one with the minimum number of stops. If there are multiple trails with the same minimum stops, we choose the last one in the input.

4. **Output the Result**: Write the result to the output file.

Here's the C++ code implementing the above logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Trail {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> springs;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int k;
    fin >> k;

    std::vector<Trail> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trails[i].id >> trails[i].num_springs;
        trails[i].springs.resize(trails[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < trails[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_trail = -1;

    for (const auto& trail : trails) {
        std::vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1); // Distance to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_distance = 0;
        int last_refill = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            if (springs[i] - last_refill > t) {
                fout << 0 << std::endl;
                return 0;
            }

            if (springs[i] - current_distance > u) {
                ++stops;
                current_distance = springs[i - 1];
                last_refill = springs[i - 1];
            }
        }

        if (stops < min_stops) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_trail = trail.id;
        } else if (stops == min_stops) {
            chosen_trail = trail.id;
        }
    }

    fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_trail << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of trails and details of each trail into a vector of `Trail` structures.
2. **Processing Each Trail**: For each trail, we add an extra spring at the peak (distance of the last spring + 1 km).
3. **Greedy Approach**: We check if the hiker can reach the next spring without exceeding the distance `u` he can travel without water. If not, we increment the stop counter and update the current distance to the last spring where he refilled.
4. **Choosing the Best Trail**: We keep track of the trail with the minimum stops. If there are multiple such trails, we choose the last one as per the problem's requirement.
5. **Output**: Finally, we write the result to the output file.

This approach ensures that we find the optimal trail efficiently.

---------- assistant ----------

The error message indicates that `INT_MAX` is not recognized because the `<climits>` header is not included. To fix this, we need to include the `<climits>` header at the beginning of the program.

Here is the corrected and complete C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits> // Include this header for INT_MAX

struct Trail {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> springs;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int k;
    fin >> k;

    std::vector<Trail> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trails[i].id >> trails[i].num_springs;
        trails[i].springs.resize(trails[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < trails[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_trail = -1;

    for (const auto& trail : trails) {
        std::vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1); // Distance to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_distance = 0;
        int last_refill = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            if (springs[i] - last_refill > t) {
                fout << 0 << std::endl;
                return 0;
            }

            if (springs[i] - current_distance > u) {
                ++stops;
                current_distance = springs[i - 1];
                last_refill = springs[i - 1];
            }
        }

        if (stops < min_stops) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_trail = trail.id;
        } else if (stops == min_stops) {
            chosen_trail = trail.id;
        }
    }

    fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_trail << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Include `<climits>` Header**: This header file is necessary for using `INT_MAX`, which represents the maximum value for an `int` type in C++.
2. **Rest of the Code**: The rest of the code remains the same as it correctly implements the logic to find the trail with the minimum number of stops.

This should now compile and run correctly, reading from `popas.in` and writing the result to `popas.out`.

The primary issue with the current implementation is that it incorrectly handles the case where the hiker cannot reach the next spring within the distance `u` they can travel without water. The current logic prematurely outputs `0` if the distance between two springs exceeds `t`, which is not the correct approach.

We need to ensure that:
1. The hiker can always refill the thermos before running out of water.
2. The number of stops is minimized.
3. If multiple trails have the same number of stops, the last one in the input file should be selected.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Correctly handle the distances between springs and the peak.
- Use a more precise greedy algorithm to ensure the hiker refills at the optimal points.

Here's the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits> // Include this header for INT_MAX

        trails[i].springs.resize(trails[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < trails[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_trail = -1;

    for (const auto& trail : trails) {
        std::vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1); // Distance to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_distance = 0;
        int last_refill = 0;
        bool possible = true;

        for (int i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            if (springs[i] - last_refill > t) {
                possible = false;
                break;
            }

            if (springs[i] - current_distance > u) {
                ++stops;
                current_distance = springs[i - 1];
                last_refill = springs[i - 1];

    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_trail << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Correct Handling of Distances**: The code now correctly checks if the distance between the last refill point and the next spring exceeds the distance `t` that the water lasts. If it does, the trail is marked as impossible.
2. **Greedy Algorithm**: The code ensures that the hiker refills at the optimal points by checking if the distance to the next spring exceeds the maximum distance `u` the hiker can travel without water.
3. **Selection of Trail**: The code now correctly updates the chosen trail if the current trail has fewer or equal stops compared to the minimum found so far, ensuring the last such trail is selected.

This should now produce the correct output for the given input.

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Correct Handling of Distances**: The code now correctly checks if the distance between the last refill point and the next spring exceeds the distance `t` that the water lasts. If it does, the trail is marked as impossible.
2. **Greedy Algorithm**: The code ensures that the hiker refills at the optimal points by checking if the distance to the next spring exceeds the maximum distance `u` the hiker can travel without water.
3. **Selection of Trail**: The code now correctly updates the chosen trail if the current trail has fewer or equal stops compared to the minimum found so far, ensuring the last such trail is selected.

This should now produce the correct output for the given input.

The previous solution has a fundamental flaw in its logic for determining the feasibility of a trail and calculating the number of stops. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the greedy approach for refilling the thermos at the optimal points.

To address this, we need to:
1. Ensure that the hiker can always refill the thermos before running out of water.
2. Implement a more precise greedy algorithm to ensure the hiker refills at the optimal points.
3. Correctly handle the distances between springs and the peak.

Here is the corrected and complete C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

struct Trail {
    int id;
    int num_springs;
    std::vector<int> springs;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("popas.in");
    std::ofstream fout("popas.out");

    int k;
    fin >> k;

    std::vector<Trail> trails(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        fin >> trails[i].id >> trails[i].num_springs;
        trails[i].springs.resize(trails[i].num_springs);
        for (int j = 0; j < trails[i].num_springs; ++j) {
            fin >> trails[i].springs[j];
        }
    }

    int t, u;
    fin >> t >> u;

    int min_stops = INT_MAX;
    int chosen_trail = -1;

    for (const auto& trail : trails) {
        std::vector<int> springs = trail.springs;
        springs.push_back(springs.back() + 1); // Distance to the peak

        int stops = 0;
        int current_distance = 0;
        bool possible = true;

        for (int i = 0; i < springs.size(); ++i) {
            if (springs[i] - current_distance > t) {
                possible = false;
                break;
            }

            if (i > 0 && springs[i] - springs[i - 1] > u) {
                possible = false;
                break;
            }

            if (i > 0 && springs[i] - current_distance > u) {
                ++stops;
                current_distance = springs[i - 1];
            }
        }

        if (possible && stops <= min_stops) {
            min_stops = stops;
            chosen_trail = trail.id;
        }
    }

    if (chosen_trail == -1) {
        fout << 0 << std::endl;
    } else {
        fout << min_stops << " " << chosen_trail << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
