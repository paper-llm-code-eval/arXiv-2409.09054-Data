Gigel a primit de ziua lui un joc cu bile. Jocul conține $n$ bile numerotate cu numerele naturale distincte de la $1$ la $n$. Jucându-se, Gigel a amestecat bilele astfel încât acum ele nu mai sunt în ordine. Ca să le pună înapoi în cutia jocului, Gigel ia de pe masă bilele una câte una, și le pune în cutie formând un șir. Însă Gigel se joacă și acum, astfel încât el nu pune bilele la rând, una după alta, ci are o regulă pe care o respectă cu strictețe. Astfel, Gigel încearcă să plaseze fiecare bilă pe care a luat-o de pe masă exact la mijlocul șirului de bile deja format. Dacă acest lucru nu este posibil (șirul are lungime impară), atunci el plasează bila la sfârșitul șirului de bile deja format. După ce toate bilele au fost puse în cutie, Gigel își dă seama că nu a notat ordinea în care a luat bilele de pe masă și, în mod firesc, își pune problema dacă nu cumva poate deduce acest lucru din șirul de bile pe care tocmai l-a format.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se numărul de bile și configurația finală a bilelor în șir să se determine:
1. numărul ultimei bile luate de pe masă;
2. ordinea în care bilele au fost luate de pe masă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ordine.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $n$ de bile. Pe linia a doua a fișierului de intrare se găsesc $n$ numere naturale, cu valori între $1$ și $n$, separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă șirul de bile obținut de Gigel în cutie. Linia a treia conține una dintre valorile $1$ sau $2$ reprezentând cerința $1$, dacă se cere determinarea ultimei bile luate de Gigel de pe masă, respectiv cerința $2$, dacă se cere determinarea ordinii în care Gigel a luat bilele de pe masă.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `ordine.out` va conține pe prima linie o valoarea naturală reprezentând numărul ultimei bile luate de Gigel, dacă cerința a fost $1$, respectiv $n$ numere naturale, cu valori cuprinse între $1$ și $n$, separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă ordinea în care Gigel a luat bilele de pe masă, dacă cerința a fost $2$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 250 \ 000$;
* Pentru cerința $1$ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerința $2$ se acordă $70\%$ din punctaj.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to reverse-engineer the process Gigel used to place the balls in the sequence. Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:

1. **Reading Input**: We need to read the input values from `ordine.in`.
2. **Determine the Task**: Based on the third line of the input, determine whether we need to find the last ball taken or the order of all balls taken.
3. **Simulate the Process**: To reverse the process, we need to simulate placing balls in the sequence according to the rules given.
4. **Output the Result**: Write the result to `ordine.out` based on the task.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of balls `n`.
   - Read the sequence of balls.
   - Read the task identifier (1 or 2).

2. **Simulate the Process**:
   - To determine the order in which the balls were taken, we need to simulate the reverse of the process described.
   - Use a deque to simulate the sequence and reverse the process of placing balls.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If the task is to find the last ball taken, output the last ball.
   - If the task is to find the order of all balls taken, output the order.

### Implementation in C++

Here is the C++ code that implements the above logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <deque>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> sequence(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }

    int task;
    fin >> task;

    std::deque<int> deque;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (deque.size() % 2 == 0) {
            deque.push_front(sequence[i]);
        } else {
            deque.push_back(sequence[i]);
        }
    }

    if (task == 1) {
        fout << deque.front() << "\n";
    } else {
        std::vector<int> order;
        while (!deque.empty()) {
            order.push_back(deque.front());
            deque.pop_front();
        }
        for (int i = order.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            fout << order[i] << (i == 0 ? "\n" : " ");
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `ordine.in`.
   - Read the number of balls `n`.
   - Read the sequence into a vector `sequence`.
   - Read the task identifier.

2. **Simulate the Process**:
   - We use a `deque` to simulate the sequence.
   - Iterate through the sequence in reverse.
   - Depending on the current size of the deque (even or odd), push elements to the front or back of the deque.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If the task is `1`, output the first element of the deque.
   - If the task is `2`, convert the deque to a vector and output the elements in reverse order.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the constraints provided.

I apologize for the mistake in the initial implementation. Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the correct approach to solve it.

### Problem Analysis

Gigel places each ball in the middle of the sequence if possible, otherwise at the end. To reverse this process, we need to simulate the reverse of the placement process.

### Key Observations

1. **Reverse Simulation**:
   - If the sequence length is even, the ball was placed at the end.
   - If the sequence length is odd, the ball was placed in the middle.

2. **Reconstructing the Order**:
   - By reversing the sequence and simulating the reverse of the placement process, we can determine the order in which the balls were picked.

### Correct Approach

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of balls `n`.
   - Read the sequence of balls.
   - Read the task identifier (1 or 2).

2. **Reverse Simulation**:
   - Use a deque to simulate the reverse process.
   - Iterate through the sequence in reverse order, and based on the current length of the deque, determine where the ball was originally placed.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If the task is to find the last ball taken, output the last ball.
   - If the task is to find the order of all balls taken, output the order.

    }

    int task;

        } else {
            deque.push_front(sequence[i]);
        }
    }

    if (task == 1) {
        fout << deque.back() << "\n";
    } else {
        std::vector<int> order;
        while (!deque.empty()) {
            order.push_back(deque.back());
            deque.pop_back();
        }
        for (int i = order.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            fout << order[i] << (i == 0 ? "\n" : " ");
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}

2. **Reverse Simulation**:
   - We use a `deque` to simulate the sequence.
   - Iterate through the sequence in reverse.
   - Depending on the current size of the deque (even or odd), push elements to the front or back of the deque.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If the task is `1`, output the last element of the order (since it represents the last ball taken).
   - If the task is `2`, output the order in the correct sequence.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the constraints provided. The primary fix here was to correctly simulate the reverse placement process to determine the correct order of balls.

I apologize for the previous errors. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and correct the approach to ensure we get the correct solution.

### Problem Analysis

Gigel places each ball in the middle of the sequence if possible, otherwise at the end. To reverse this process, we need to simulate the reverse of the placement process.

### Key Observations

1. **Reverse Simulation**:
   - When the sequence length is even, the ball was placed at the end.
   - When the sequence length is odd, the ball was placed in the middle.

2. **Reconstructing the Order**:
   - By reversing the sequence and simulating the reverse of the placement process, we can determine the order in which the balls were picked.

### Correct Approach

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of balls `n`.
   - Read the sequence of balls.
   - Read the task identifier (1 or 2).

2. **Reverse Simulation**:
   - Use a deque to simulate the reverse process.
   - Iterate through the sequence in reverse order, and based on the current length of the deque, determine where the ball was originally placed.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If the task is to find the last ball taken, output the last ball.
   - If the task is to find the order of all balls taken, output the order.

### Rewritten Solution in C++

Here's the corrected implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <deque>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("ordine.in");
    std::ofstream fout("ordine.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    std::vector<int> sequence(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> sequence[i];
    }

    int task;
    fin >> task;

    // To determine the order in which balls were taken
    std::deque<int> deque;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (deque.size() % 2 == 0) {
            deque.push_back(sequence[i]);
        } else {
            deque.push_front(sequence[i]);
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> order;
    while (!deque.empty()) {
        order.push_back(deque.front());
        deque.pop_front();
    }

    if (task == 1) {
        fout << order.back() << "\n";
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            fout << order[i] << (i == n - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We use `ifstream` to read from `ordine.in`.
   - Read the number of balls `n`.
   - Read the sequence into a vector `sequence`.
   - Read the task identifier.

2. **Reverse Simulation**:
   - We use a `deque` to simulate the sequence.
   - Iterate through the sequence in reverse.
   - Depending on the current size of the deque (even or odd), push elements to the front or back of the deque.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If the task is `1`, output the last element of the order (since it represents the last ball taken).
   - If the task is `2`, output the order in the correct sequence.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the constraints provided. The primary fix here was to correctly simulate the reverse placement process to determine the correct order of balls.
