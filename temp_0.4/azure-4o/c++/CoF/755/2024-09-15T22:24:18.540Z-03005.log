Marele vrăjitor Prospero are o grădină minunată îngrijită de o sumedenie de spiriduși care n-au altă sarcină decât să zboare la orele dimineții de-a lungul aleilor și să stropească plantele din vasele ornamentale de piatră aflate pe margine. Există un havuz chiar la capătul grădinii și o alee principală ce pornește de la havuz și duce până la intrare. Din aleea principală se desprind alei secundare ce formează ronduri alungite revenind, în același loc, la aleea principală.

Se știe că există $n$ spiriduși, numerotați de la $1$ la $n$, fiecare pentru câte una dintre aleile secundare. Toți pornesc de la havuz la ora $5:00:00$ dimineața cu câte un vas cu apă pregătit de cu seară, străbat aleea principală până la rondul lor, apoi parcurg aleea rondului propriu, revin în aleea principală, se întorc la havuz pentru a se alimenta cu apă și o iau de la capăt la fel, până la ora $9:00:00$ când se retrag la umbră pentru somn. Se știe că toți spiridușii zboară fără încetare, cu aceeași viteză, pe toată durata celor exact $4$ ore. Se cunosc, pentru fiecare spiriduș, numărul de secunde necesare pentru a ajunge de la havuz la rondul propriu și numărul de secunde necesare pentru a parcurge în întregime rondul propriu. Orice spiriduș care ajunge la havuz își umple vasul în exact o secundă, de la un robinet aflat pe marginea havuzului. De exemplu, dacă spiridușul care se ocupă de rondul $5$ din figură are nevoie de $2$ secunde pentru a ajunge la rondul său și de $15$ secunde pentru a parcurge rondul $5$, atunci va reveni la havuz pentru a-și umple vasul la orele $5:00:19$ ($2 + 15 + 2$), își umple vasul și pornește iar la ora $5:00:20$, revine iar la $5:00:39$ și pleacă iar la ora $5:00:40$ etc.

Doi spiriduși nu își pot umple vasul în același moment de la același robinet.

# Cerință

Se cere să se determine numărul minim de robinete cu care trebuie să fie prevăzut havuzul astfel încât nici un spiriduş, în nici un moment, să nu fie nevoit să aştepte pentru a-şi putea umple vasul cu apă.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `elfi.in` se citesc:

* $n$, numărul de spiriduși, de pe primul rând;
* $n$ perechi de forma $c_i \ p_i$ reprezentând numărul de secunde de la havuz la rondul propriu și respectiv numărul de secunde necesar pentru parcurgerea rondului propriu, de pe următoarele $n$ linii ale fișierului.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `elfi.out` se scrie o singura linie cu un singur număr reprezentând numărul minim de robinete necesare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 5 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100$;
* $1 \leq p_i \leq 100$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the minimum number of faucets required such that no elf has to wait to refill their water vessel. The key is to simulate the times at which each elf returns to the fountain and needs to refill.

Here's the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Parse Input:** Read the number of elves and their respective times from the input file.
2. **Calculate Refill Times:** For each elf, calculate the times at which they will need to refill their water vessel over the 4-hour period.
3. **Simulate Faucet Usage:** Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the times when each faucet will be available. This allows us to efficiently allocate the next available faucet to an elf when they need to refill.
4. **Determine Minimum Faucets:** Track the maximum number of faucets in use at any time to determine the minimum number of faucets required.

Here's the C++ code to implement this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("elfi.in");
    ofstream outfile("elfi.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    vector<pair<int, int>> elves(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> elves[i].first >> elves[i].second;
    }

    // Priority queue to track the next available time of each faucet
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> faucetQueue;

    // Calculate the times each elf will need to refill
    for (const auto& elf : elves) {
        int c = elf.first;
        int p = elf.second;
        int cycleTime = 2 * c + p + 1; // Time for one complete cycle including refill

        // Calculate refill times for the 4-hour period
        for (int t = c + p + c; t < 4 * 3600; t += cycleTime) {
            if (!faucetQueue.empty() && faucetQueue.top() <= t) {
                faucetQueue.pop();
            }
            faucetQueue.push(t);
        }
    }

    // The size of the priority queue is the number of faucets needed
    outfile << faucetQueue.size() << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of elves `n` and then read the pairs of integers representing the time to reach the round (`c_i`) and the time to complete the round (`p_i`).

2. **Priority Queue for Faucet Availability:**
   - We use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the next available time for each faucet. This helps efficiently manage the allocation of faucets to elves as they return to refill.

3. **Calculating Refill Times:**
   - For each elf, we calculate the times they will need to refill their water vessels. This is done by iterating over the 4-hour period and calculating the times based on the cycle time (`2 * c_i + p_i + 1`).

4. **Simulating Faucet Usage:**
   - For each calculated refill time, we check if any faucet is available (i.e., the top of the priority queue is less than or equal to the current refill time). If a faucet is available, we reuse it by popping the top of the queue.
   - We then push the current refill time onto the queue, representing the time when this faucet will next be available.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - The size of the priority queue at the end represents the maximum number of faucets that were in use simultaneously, which is the minimum number of faucets required.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of faucets needed without having to simulate every second of the 4-hour period explicitly.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output suggests that the initial solution might have a logical flaw or oversight in handling the refill times. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Re-evaluation of the Problem
Each elf has a cycle time which includes:
1. Time to reach their round and back.
2. Time to complete the round.
3. One second to refill their vessel.

Given:
- Each elf starts at the fountain at 5:00:00.
- The total duration they operate is 4 hours (14,400 seconds).

The goal is to determine the minimum number of faucets required such that no two elves need to refill at the same time.

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Cycle Time Calculation**: For each elf, the cycle time is `2 * c_i + p_i + 1`.
2. **Refill Times**: Calculate the exact times when each elf will need to refill their vessel.
3. **Overlap Management**: Use a data structure that efficiently manages overlapping intervals to determine the maximum overlap at any point in time.

### Revised Approach
1. **Calculate Refill Times**: For each elf, calculate all the refill times within the 4-hour period.
2. **Event Management**: Treat each refill as an event and use a sweep line algorithm to determine the maximum number of overlapping events.

### Implementation
We'll use a vector to store all refill events and then sort these events. By sweeping through these events, we can determine the maximum number of concurrent refills, which corresponds to the number of faucets needed.

Here's the revised C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("elfi.in");
    ofstream outfile("elfi.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    vector<pair<int, int>> elves(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> elves[i].first >> elves[i].second;
    }

    vector<int> refillTimes;

    for (const auto& elf : elves) {
        int c = elf.first;
        int p = elf.second;
        int cycleTime = 2 * c + p + 1; // Time for one complete cycle including refill

        for (int t = c + p + c; t < 4 * 3600; t += cycleTime) {
            refillTimes.push_back(t);
        }
    }

    sort(refillTimes.begin(), refillTimes.end());

    int maxFaucets = 0;
    int currentFaucets = 0;
    int lastTime = -1;

    for (int t : refillTimes) {
        if (t != lastTime) {
            maxFaucets = max(maxFaucets, currentFaucets);
            lastTime = t;
        }
        currentFaucets++;
    }

    maxFaucets = max(maxFaucets, currentFaucets);

    outfile << maxFaucets << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Revised Code:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of elves and their respective times from the input file.
2. **Calculate Refill Times**: For each elf, we calculate all the times they will need to refill within the 4-hour period and store these times in a vector.
3. **Sort Refill Times**: We sort the refill times to facilitate the sweep line algorithm.
4. **Sweep Line Algorithm**: We iterate through the sorted refill times and count the number of overlapping events to determine the maximum overlap, which represents the number of faucets needed.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum number of faucets required by accurately managing the refill times and their overlaps.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output indicates that there is a logical error in the code. Specifically, the problem lies in how the refill times are being calculated and managed. Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the necessary fixes.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Refill Times**: The previous implementation incorrectly calculates the refill times by not accounting for the initial start time and the cycle time correctly.
2. **Handling Overlaps**: The method to handle overlaps needs to be more precise to ensure accurate counting of concurrent refills.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Refill Times Properly**: For each elf, calculate the exact times they will need to refill their vessel, considering the initial start time and the complete cycle time.
2. **Event Management**: Use a sweep line algorithm with events for both start and end of refills to determine the maximum number of concurrent refills.

### Revised Implementation:
We'll use a vector to store events (start and end of each refill) and then sort these events. By sweeping through these events, we can determine the maximum number of concurrent refills.

Here’s the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("elfi.in");
    ofstream outfile("elfi.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    vector<pair<int, int>> elves(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> elves[i].first >> elves[i].second;
    }

    vector<pair<int, int>> events; // (time, type) where type is 1 for start and -1 for end

    for (const auto& elf : elves) {
        int c = elf.first;
        int p = elf.second;
        int cycleTime = 2 * c + p + 1; // Time for one complete cycle including refill

        // Calculate refill times within the 4-hour period
        for (int t = c + p + c; t < 4 * 3600; t += cycleTime) {
            events.emplace_back(t, 1);     // Start of refill
            events.emplace_back(t + 1, -1); // End of refill
        }
    }

    // Sort events by time; if times are the same, end event (-1) should come before start event (1)
    sort(events.begin(), events.end());

    int maxFaucets = 0;
    int currentFaucets = 0;

    for (const auto& event : events) {
        currentFaucets += event.second;
        if (event.second == 1) {
            maxFaucets = max(maxFaucets, currentFaucets);
        }
    }

    outfile << maxFaucets << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of elves and their respective times from the input file.
2. **Calculate Refill Times Properly**: For each elf, we calculate all the times they will need to refill within the 4-hour period and store these times as events (start and end) in a vector.
3. **Sort Events**: We sort the events by time. If two events have the same time, the end event (-1) should come before the start event (1) to ensure correct counting.
4. **Sweep Line Algorithm**: We iterate through the sorted events and count the number of concurrent refills to determine the maximum overlap, which represents the number of faucets needed.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum number of faucets required by accurately managing the refill times and their overlaps.
