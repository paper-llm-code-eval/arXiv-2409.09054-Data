Se generează un şir de numere naturale ai cărui primi termeni sunt, în ordine:

$1$, $12$, $21$, $123$, $231$, $312$, $1234$, $2341$, $3412$, $4123$, $12345$, $23451$, ...

# Cerință

Deduceţi regula după care sunt generaţi termenii şirului şi scrieţi un program care să citească numerele naturale $k$, $x$, $a$ şi $b$ şi care să determine:

1. ultima cifră a sumei tuturor termenilor şirului care sunt formaţi din cel mult $k$ cifre;
2. succesorul termenului $x$ în şirul dat, $x$ fiind un termen al şirului;
3. numărul de termeni ai şirului care au cifra cea mai semnificativă egală cu $a$ şi nu conţin în scrierea lor cifra $b$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `sir.in` conţine o singură linie pe care sunt scrise cele patru numere naturale $k$, $x$, $a$ şi $b$, separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `sir.out` va conține 3 linii:

* pe prima linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând ultima cifră a sumei tuturor termenilor şirului care sunt formaţi din cel mult $k$ cifre;
* pe a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând succesorul termenului $x$ în şirul dat;
* pe a treia linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de termeni ai şirului care au cifra cea mai semnificativă egală cu $a$ şi nu conţin în scrierea lor cifra $b$.


# Restricții și precizări

* Numerele $k$, $x$, $a$ şi $b$ sunt naturale nenule
* $1 \leq k \leq 9$;
* $x$ este un termen al şirului din enunţ şi are succesor în şir 
* succesorul termenului $x$ în şir este termenul care urmează imediat după $x$ (de exemplu, dacă $x = 2341$ atunci succesorului lui $x$ în şir este $3412$)
* $1 \leq x < 9 \cdot 10^8$;
* $1 \leq a, b \leq 9$; $a \neq b$;
* cifra cea mai semnificativă a unui număr natural este prima cifră din scrierea sa, de la stânga la dreapta (de exemplu cifra cea mai semnificativă a numărului $32156$ este $3$)
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă 30% din punctaj, pentru cerinţa b) 40% din punctaj şi pentru cerinţa c) 30% din punctaj.

### Explanation:

1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `generate_sequence` generates the sequence of numbers according to the given pattern for up to `k` digits.
   - For each length from `1` to `k`, it generates the initial term (e.g., "123" for length 3) and then generates all cyclic permutations of this term.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the input values `k`, `x`, `a`, and `b` from the file `sir.in`.

3. **Part 1**:
   - It calculates the sum of all terms in the sequence and outputs the last digit of this sum.

4. **Part 2**:
   - It finds the term `x` in the sequence and outputs its successor.

5. **Part 3**:
   - It counts the number of terms that start with digit `a` and do not contain digit `b`.

The program reads from `sir.in` and writes the results to `sir.out` as required.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Let's re-evaluate the problem and identify the issues in the initial implementation.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The initial implementation generates all cyclic permutations for each length up to `k`, but it doesn't handle the transition between different lengths correctly.
   
2. **Successor Calculation**:
   - The successor calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the exact format of the sequence.

3. **Counting Terms**:
   - The counting logic should be verified to ensure it correctly handles the constraints.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - Generate terms by iterating over lengths from 1 to `k`.
   - For each length, generate the initial sequence and its cyclic permutations.

2. **Successor Calculation**:
   - Find the exact successor by rotating the digits of the term.

3. **Counting Terms**:
   - Ensure that terms are counted correctly based on the leading digit and the absence of a specific digit.

Here's the corrected and optimized solution:

    for (const auto& term : sequence) {
        sum += std::stoll(term);
    }
    fout << (sum % 10) << '\n';

    // Part 2: Successor of term x

    } else if (it == sequence.end() - 1) {
        fout << *sequence.begin() << '\n';
    }

    // Part 3: Count terms with leading digit a and not containing digit b
    int count = 0;
    char a_char = '0' + a;
    char b_char = '0' + b;
    for (const auto& term : sequence) {

            ++count;
        }
    }
    fout << count << '\n';

I apologize for the repeated mistakes. Let's re-evaluate the problem carefully, identify the issues, and provide a correct solution.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - Generate terms by iterating over lengths from 1 to `k`.
   - For each length, generate the initial sequence and its cyclic permutations.

2. **Successor Calculation**:
   - Find the exact successor by rotating the digits of the term.

3. **Counting Terms**:
   - Ensure that terms are counted correctly based on the leading digit and the absence of a specific digit.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - Generate terms by iterating over lengths from 1 to `k`.
   - For each length, generate the initial sequence and its cyclic permutations.

2. **Successor Calculation**:
   - Find the exact successor by rotating the digits of the term.

3. **Counting Terms**:
   - Ensure that terms are counted correctly based on the leading digit and the absence of a specific digit.

Here's the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>

// Function to generate the sequence up to length k
std::vector<std::string> generate_sequence(int k) {
    std::vector<std::string> sequence;
    for (int length = 1; length <= k; ++length) {
        std::string initial;
        for (int i = 1; i <= length; ++i) {
            initial += std::to_string(i);
        }
        std::string current = initial;
        do {
            sequence.push_back(current);
            std::rotate(current.begin(), current.begin() + 1, current.end());
        } while (current != initial);
    }
    return sequence;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("sir.in");
    std::ofstream fout("sir.out");

    int k, x, a, b;
    fin >> k >> x >> a >> b;

    std::vector<std::string> sequence = generate_sequence(k);

    // Part 1: Last digit of the sum of all terms with at most k digits
    long long sum = 0;
    for (const auto& term : sequence) {
        sum += std::stoll(term);
    }
    fout << (sum % 10) << '\n';

    // Part 2: Successor of term x
    std::string x_str = std::to_string(x);
    auto it = std::find(sequence.begin(), sequence.end(), x_str);
    if (it != sequence.end() && (it + 1) != sequence.end()) {
        fout << *(it + 1) << '\n';
    } else if (it == sequence.end() - 1) {
        fout << *sequence.begin() << '\n';
    }

    // Part 3: Count terms with leading digit a and not containing digit b
    int count = 0;
    char a_char = '0' + a;
    char b_char = '0' + b;
    for (const auto& term : sequence) {
        if (term[0] == a_char && term.find(b_char) == std::string::npos) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    fout << count << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `generate_sequence` generates the sequence of numbers according to the given pattern for up to `k` digits.
   - For each length from `1` to `k`, it generates the initial term (e.g., "123" for length 3) and then generates all cyclic permutations of this term.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the input values `k`, `x`, `a`, and `b` from the file `sir.in`.

3. **Part 1**:
   - It calculates the sum of all terms in the sequence and outputs the last digit of this sum.

4. **Part 2**:
   - It finds the term `x` in the sequence and outputs its successor. If `x` is the last term, it wraps around to the first term.

5. **Part 3**:
   - It counts the number of terms that start with digit `a` and do not contain digit `b`.

The program reads from `sir.in` and writes the results to `sir.out` as required. This solution should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected results.
