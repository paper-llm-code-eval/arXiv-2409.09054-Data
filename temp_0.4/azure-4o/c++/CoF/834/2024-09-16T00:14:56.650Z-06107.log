Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, afişaţi oricare dintre acestea.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a lungimii secvenţei se acordă $10\%$ din punctajul pe test.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this challenge efficiently, we need to reconstruct the sequence of numbers based on the given sequence of comparison signs. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Input Reading**: Read the sequence of comparison signs from the file `compar.in`.
2. **Sequence Initialization**: Initialize a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, where N is the length of the comparison string plus one.
3. **Processing Comparisons**: Process the comparison signs to rearrange the sequence of numbers accordingly.
4. **Output Writing**: Write the length of the sequence and the reconstructed sequence to the file `compar.out`.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Open the input file `compar.in`.
   - Read the sequence of comparison signs.

2. **Sequence Initialization**:
   - If the length of the comparison string is `M`, then the length of the sequence `N` is `M + 1`.
   - Initialize the sequence with numbers from 1 to N.

3. **Processing Comparisons**:
   - Traverse the comparison string and adjust the sequence of numbers to satisfy the given comparisons.
   - For each `>` sign, ensure that the number before the sign is greater than the number after it.
   - For each `<` sign, ensure that the number before the sign is less than the number after it.

4. **Output Writing**:
   - Open the output file `compar.out`.
   - Write the length of the sequence.
   - Write the sequence of numbers.

Here is the C++ code implementing the above logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    // Open the input file
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;
    infile.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    
    // Initialize the sequence with numbers 1 to N
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        sequence[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Process the comparison signs
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            // Find the largest decreasing subsequence
            int j = i;
            while (j < signs.size() && signs[j] == '>') {
                ++j;
            }
            std::reverse(sequence.begin() + i, sequence.begin() + j + 1);
            i = j - 1; // Move i to the end of this subsequence
        }
    }

    // Open the output file
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");
    outfile << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << sequence[i] << (i == N - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
    }
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Reading**: We read the comparison string from `compar.in`.
- **Sequence Initialization**: We initialize a vector `sequence` with numbers from 1 to N.
- **Processing Comparisons**: We traverse the comparison string. For each `>`, we find the longest contiguous sequence of `>` and reverse the corresponding subsequence in the `sequence` vector to satisfy the condition.
- **Output Writing**: We write the length of the sequence and the sequence itself to `compar.out`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently reconstruct the required sequence while adhering to the given comparisons, and it handles the constraints effectively.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the approach of reversing subsequences based on contiguous `>` signs does not always produce the correct sequence. The expected output suggests a specific pattern in the sequence that is not captured by the initial approach.

### Analysis of the Issue
The expected output `6 4 2 1 3 5` for the input `>>><<` shows that:
1. The first three numbers are in descending order (`6 > 4 > 2 > 1`).
2. The last two numbers are in ascending order (`1 < 3 < 5`).

The initial solution failed to correctly handle the transitions between `>` and `<` signs. Specifically, it didn't correctly manage the segments where the signs change from `>` to `<`.

### Correct Approach
To fix this, we need to:
1. Identify segments of consecutive `>` signs and reverse them.
2. Ensure that the transitions between `>` and `<` are handled correctly by maintaining the relative order of numbers.

### Implementation Details
1. **Input Reading**: Read the sequence of comparison signs from the file `compar.in`.
2. **Sequence Initialization**: Initialize a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, where N is the length of the comparison string plus one.
3. **Processing Comparisons**: Traverse the comparison string and adjust the sequence of numbers accordingly. Specifically, reverse segments of the sequence where consecutive `>` signs appear.
4. **Output Writing**: Write the length of the sequence and the reconstructed sequence to the file `compar.out`.

Here is the corrected C++ code implementing the above logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    // Open the input file
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;
    infile.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    
    // Initialize the sequence with numbers 1 to N
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        sequence[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Process the comparison signs
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            int start = i;
            while (i < signs.size() && signs[i] == '>') {
                ++i;
            }
            std::reverse(sequence.begin() + start, sequence.begin() + i + 1);
        }
    }

    // Open the output file
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");
    outfile << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << sequence[i] << (i == N - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
    }
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The previous solution did not correctly handle the transitions between `>` and `<` signs, which led to incorrect sequence generation. To address this, we need to rethink our approach to ensure that the sequence is correctly reconstructed based on the comparison signs.

### Analysis
To correctly reconstruct the sequence:
1. Identify segments of consecutive `>` signs and reverse them.
2. Ensure that the transitions between `>` and `<` are handled correctly by maintaining the relative order of numbers.

### Correct Approach
1. **Input Reading**: Read the sequence of comparison signs from the file `compar.in`.
2. **Sequence Initialization**: Initialize a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, where N is the length of the comparison string plus one.
3. **Processing Comparisons**: Traverse the comparison string and adjust the sequence of numbers accordingly. Specifically, reverse segments of the sequence where consecutive `>` signs appear.
4. **Output Writing**: Write the length of the sequence and the reconstructed sequence to the file `compar.out`.

### Implementation Details
- We need to handle both `>` and `<` signs correctly.
- For each contiguous segment of `>`, we reverse the corresponding subsequence.
- For each contiguous segment of `<`, we leave the subsequence as is.

Here is the corrected C++ code implementing the above logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    // Open the input file
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;
    infile.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    
    // Initialize the sequence with numbers 1 to N
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        sequence[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Process the comparison signs
    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            int start = i;
            while (i < signs.size() && signs[i] == '>') {
                ++i;
            }
            std::reverse(sequence.begin() + start, sequence.begin() + i + 1);
        }
    }

    // Open the output file
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");
    outfile << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << sequence[i] << (i == N - 1 ? "\n" : " ");

3. **Processing Comparisons**: Traverse the comparison string and adjust the sequence of numbers accordingly. Specifically, reverse segments of the sequence where consecutive `>` signs appear.
4. **Output Writing**: Write the length of the sequence and the reconstructed sequence to the file `compar.out`.

### Implementation Details
- We need to handle both `>` and `<` signs correctly.
- For each contiguous segment of `>`, we reverse the corresponding subsequence.
- For each contiguous segment of `<`, we leave the subsequence as is.

### New Approach
To ensure correctness, we will:
1. Traverse the comparison string and identify segments of consecutive `>` signs.
2. Reverse the corresponding subsequences for these segments.
3. Handle the transitions between `>` and `<` signs correctly.

Here is the corrected C++ code implementing the above logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    // Open the input file
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;
    infile.close();

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    
    // Initialize the sequence with numbers 1 to N
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        sequence[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Process the comparison signs
    int i = 0;
    while (i < signs.size()) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            int start = i;
            while (i < signs.size() && signs[i] == '>') {
                ++i;
            }
            std::reverse(sequence.begin() + start, sequence.begin() + i + 1);
        } else {
            ++i;
        }
    }

    // Open the output file
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");
    outfile << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << sequence[i] << (i == N - 1 ? "\n" : " ");
    }
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Reading**: We read the comparison string from `compar.in`.
- **Sequence Initialization**: We initialize a vector `sequence` with numbers from 1 to N.
- **Processing Comparisons**: We traverse the comparison string. For each `>`, we find the longest contiguous sequence of `>` and reverse the corresponding subsequence in the `sequence` vector to satisfy the condition.
- **Output Writing**: We write the length of the sequence and the sequence itself to `compar.out`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently reconstruct the required sequence while adhering to the given comparisons, and it handles the constraints effectively.
