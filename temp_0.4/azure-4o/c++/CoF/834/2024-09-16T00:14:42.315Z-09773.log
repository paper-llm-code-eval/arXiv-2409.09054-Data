Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, afişaţi oricare dintre acestea.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a lungimii secvenţei se acordă $10\%$ din punctajul pe test.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the problem efficiently, we need to reconstruct the sequence of natural numbers based on the given signs (`<` or `>`). Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Read the Input**: Read the sequence of signs from the input file.
2. **Determine the Length of the Sequence**: The length of the sequence \( N \) is one more than the length of the string of signs.
3. **Reconstruct the Sequence**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill the sequence.
   - Start with the smallest number and place it in the sequence.
   - For each sign, decide the next number based on whether the sign is `<` or `>`.
4. **Write the Output**: Write the length of the sequence and the reconstructed sequence to the output file.

Here is the C++ code implementing the above approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);

    // Initialize the sequence with numbers from 1 to N
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        sequence[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Process the signs and adjust the sequence accordingly
    int i = 0;
    while (i < signs.size()) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            int j = i;
            while (j < signs.size() && signs[j] == '>') {
                ++j;
            }
            std::reverse(sequence.begin() + i, sequence.begin() + j + 1);
            i = j;
        } else {
            ++i;
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    outfile << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << sequence[i] << " ";
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the string of signs from `compar.in`.
2. **Determining Length**: The length of the sequence \( N \) is calculated as `signs.size() + 1`.
3. **Initializing Sequence**: We initialize a sequence with numbers from 1 to \( N \).
4. **Processing Signs**:
   - For each sign, if it is `>`, we find the contiguous segment of `>` signs and reverse the corresponding segment in the sequence.
   - If the sign is `<`, we simply move to the next sign.
5. **Writing Output**: We write the length \( N \) and the reconstructed sequence to `compar.out`.

This solution efficiently reconstructs the sequence with a time complexity of \( O(N) \) due to the single pass through the signs and the occasional segment reversals. This ensures that the solution is optimal for the given constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the initial approach of reversing segments based on contiguous `>` signs does not always yield the correct sequence. Specifically, the approach does not guarantee that the sequence will satisfy all the given comparisons.

To address this, we need to ensure that each comparison is satisfied by directly constructing the sequence while maintaining the order constraints. Here is an improved approach:

1. **Read the Input**: Read the sequence of signs from the input file.
2. **Determine the Length of the Sequence**: The length of the sequence \( N \) is one more than the length of the string of signs.
3. **Reconstruct the Sequence**:
   - Use a stack to handle the `>` signs efficiently.
   - Traverse through the signs and construct the sequence by pushing elements onto the stack when encountering `>`, and popping them when encountering `<` or at the end of the sequence.
4. **Write the Output**: Write the length of the sequence and the reconstructed sequence to the output file.

Here is the revised C++ code implementing this approach:

    // Initialize the sequence with numbers from 1 to N
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        if (i == N || signs[i - 1] == '<') {
            stk.push(i);
            while (!stk.empty()) {
                sequence.push_back(stk.top());
                stk.pop();
            }
        } else {
            stk.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    outfile << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << sequence[i] << " ";
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

2. **Determining Length**: The length of the sequence \( N \) is calculated as `signs.size() + 1`.

   - If we encounter a `<` sign or reach the end of the sequence, we push the current number onto the stack and then pop all elements from the stack into the sequence.
   - If we encounter a `>` sign, we simply push the current number onto the stack.
4. **Writing Output**: We write the length \( N \) and the reconstructed sequence to `compar.out`.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly handle the sequence of signs to produce the expected output. Specifically, the stack-based approach does not always yield the correct order when there are multiple contiguous `>` signs followed by `<` signs. 

To fix this, we can use a different approach that ensures the sequence respects the order constraints given by the signs. We can use a greedy approach to construct the sequence by always placing the largest possible number in positions dictated by `>` signs and the smallest possible number in positions dictated by `<` signs.

Here's the revised solution:

1. **Read the Input**: Read the sequence of signs from the input file.
2. **Determine the Length of the Sequence**: The length of the sequence \( N \) is one more than the length of the string of signs.
3. **Reconstruct the Sequence**:
   - Use a greedy approach to construct the sequence.
   - Traverse through the signs and construct the sequence by placing the largest possible number when encountering `>` and the smallest possible number when encountering `<`.
4. **Write the Output**: Write the length of the sequence and the reconstructed sequence to the output file.

Here is the revised C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;

    int N = signs.size() + 1;
    std::vector<int> sequence(N);
    std::vector<bool> used(N + 1, false);

    int max_num = N;
    int min_num = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < signs.size(); ++i) {
        if (signs[i] == '>') {
            sequence[i] = max_num--;
        } else {
            sequence[i] = min_num++;
        }
    }

    sequence[signs.size()] = min_num;

    outfile << N << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << sequence[i] << " ";
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the string of signs from `compar.in`.
2. **Determining Length**: The length of the sequence \( N \) is calculated as `signs.size() + 1`.
3. **Reconstructing Sequence**:
   - We initialize two pointers: `max_num` to the largest number \( N \) and `min_num` to the smallest number 1.
   - We traverse through the signs and construct the sequence:
     - If we encounter a `>`, we place the current `max_num` at the current position and decrement `max_num`.
     - If we encounter a `<`, we place the current `min_num` at the current position and increment `min_num`.
   - After the loop, we place the remaining number (either `max_num` or `min_num`, which are equal at this point) in the last position.
4. **Writing Output**: We write the length \( N \) and the reconstructed sequence to `compar.out`.

This approach ensures that the sequence satisfies all the given comparisons by maintaining the correct order of elements using a greedy strategy. This approach is efficient and works within the constraints provided.
