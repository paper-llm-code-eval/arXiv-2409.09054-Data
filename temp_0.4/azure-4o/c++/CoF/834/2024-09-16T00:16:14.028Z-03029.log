Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, afişaţi oricare dintre acestea.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a lungimii secvenţei se acordă $10\%$ din punctajul pe test.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the problem efficiently, we need to reconstruct the sequence of numbers based on the given sequence of comparison signs. Here’s the step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Read the Input**: Read the sequence of comparison signs from the file `compar.in`.
2. **Determine the Length of the Sequence**: The length of the sequence of numbers, `N`, is the length of the input string plus one.
3. **Reconstruct the Sequence**: Use a stack-based approach to reconstruct the sequence. This approach will help in efficiently handling the `<` and `>` signs to place the numbers in the correct order.

Here is the C++ code implementing the above logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    outfile << N << "\n";

    std::vector<int> result(N);
    std::stack<int> s;

    int num = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i <= signs.length(); ++i) {
        s.push(num++);
        if (i == signs.length() || signs[i] == '<') {
            while (!s.empty()) {
                result[i - s.size() + 1] = s.top();
                s.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << result[i] << " ";
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `compar.in` into the string `signs`.
2. **Calculating N**: The length of the sequence `N` is calculated as `signs.length() + 1`.
3. **Using a Stack for Reconstruction**:
   - We iterate through the signs and use a stack to manage the numbers.
   - For each character in `signs`, we push the current number onto the stack.
   - If the current sign is `<` or we have reached the end of the string, we pop all elements from the stack and place them in the result array.
4. **Output the Result**: Finally, we write the length `N` and the reconstructed sequence to `compar.out`.

This approach ensures that we handle the `<` and `>` signs efficiently and reconstruct the sequence in linear time, which is optimal for the given constraints.

The issue with the initial implementation is that it does not correctly handle the sequence of numbers based on the comparison signs. Specifically, the stack-based approach does not ensure the correct placement of numbers when there are consecutive `>` signs followed by `<` signs.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we correctly place the numbers in the sequence by carefully managing the stack and ensuring that we handle the transitions between `>` and `<` correctly.

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    outfile << N << "\n";

    std::vector<int> result;
    std::stack<int> s;

    for (int i = 0; i <= signs.length(); ++i) {
        s.push(i + 1);
        if (i == signs.length() || signs[i] == '<') {
            while (!s.empty()) {
                result.push_back(s.top());
                s.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << result[i] << " ";
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

The initial and corrected implementations did not produce the expected results because they did not handle the transitions between consecutive `>` and `<` signs correctly. The stack-based approach needs to be adjusted to ensure that we handle sequences of `>` signs properly before encountering a `<` sign.

It seems that the previous implementations did not correctly handle the transitions between consecutive `>` and `<` signs. The key issue is that the numbers are not being placed correctly when there are multiple consecutive `>` signs.

The exit code 139 indicates a segmentation fault, which is often caused by accessing invalid memory. The error message "free(): invalid next size (normal)" suggests that there might be an issue with how the stack or vector is being managed, possibly leading to memory corruption.

To address this, let's carefully manage the stack and ensure that we correctly handle the transitions between `>` and `<` signs. The previous approach used a stack to handle the sequence, but it seems to have issues with memory management.

Here is the revised C++ code that uses a different approach to ensure the correct placement of numbers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("compar.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("compar.out");

    std::string signs;
    infile >> signs;

    int N = signs.length() + 1;
    outfile << N << "\n";

    std::vector<int> result(N);
    std::stack<int> s;

    int num = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i <= signs.length(); ++i) {
        s.push(num++);
        if (i == signs.length() || signs[i] == '<') {
            while (!s.empty()) {
                result[i - s.size()] = s.top();
                s.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        outfile << result[i] << " ";
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
