Să considerăm ecuaţii de gradul I, de forma: `expresie_1=expresie_2`. Expresiile specificate sunt constituite dintr-o succesiune de operanzi, între care există semnul `+` sau semnul `-` (cu semnificaţia binecunoscută de adunare, respectiv scădere). Fiecare operand este fie un număr natural, fie un număr natural urmat de litera `x` (litera `x` reprezentând necunoscuta), fie doar litera `x` (ceea ce este echivalent cu `1x`).

De exemplu: `2x-5+10x+4=20-x`. Observaţi că în ecuaţiile noastre nu apar paranteze şi necunoscuta este întotdeauna desemnată de litera mică `x`.

# Cerința

Scrieţi un program care să rezolve ecuaţii de gradul I, în formatul specificat în enunţul problemei.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ecuatii.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de ecuaţii din fişier. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii este scrisă câte o ecuaţie.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ecuatii.out` va conține $n$ linii, câte una pentru fiecare ecuaţie din fişierul de intrare. Pe linia $i$ va fi scrisă soluţia ecuaţiei de pe linia $i+1$ din fişierul de intrare.

Dacă soluţia ecuaţiei este un număr real, atunci acesta se va scrie cu 4 zecimale. Răspunsul este considerat corect dacă diferenţa în valoare absolută dintre soluţia corectă şi soluţia concurentului este < 0.001.

În cazul în care ecuaţia admite o infinitate de soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `infinit` (cu litere mici).

Dacă ecuaţia nu admite soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `imposibil` (de asemenea cu litere mici).

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 10$;
* Lungimea unei ecuaţii nu depăşeşte 255 caractere;
* Ecuaţiile nu conţin spaţii;
* Numerele naturale care intervin în ecuaţii sunt $\leq 1000$.

Example:
`ecuatii.in`
```
3 
2x-4+5x+300=98x
x+2=2+x
3x+5=3x+2
```

`ecuatii.out`
```
3.2527
infinit
imposibil

The differences between the expected and found results indicate that there is a bug in the parsing or evaluation logic of the original solution. Specifically:

1. The first equation `2x-4+5x+300=98x` should yield `3.2527` but the solution returned `infinit`.
2. The second equation `x+2=2+x` should yield `infinit` but the solution returned `2.1758`.

The issue seems to be in the parsing or evaluation of the expressions, particularly in how the coefficients and constants are calculated and compared.

### Comprehensive Explanation

1. **First Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `2x-4+5x+300=98x` simplifies to `7x + 296 = 98x`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `7x - 98x = -296` which simplifies to `-91x = -296`.
   - Solving for `x`, we get `x = 296 / 91 ≈ 3.2527`.

2. **Second Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `x+2=2+x` simplifies to `x + 2 = 2 + x`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `x - x = 2 - 2` which simplifies to `0 = 0`.
   - This indicates infinite solutions.

3. **Third Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `3x+5=3x+2` simplifies to `3x + 5 = 3x + 2`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `3x - 3x = 2 - 5` which simplifies to `0 = -3`.
   - This indicates no solutions.

The parsing logic needs to correctly handle the coefficients and constants for both sides of the equation. Let's rewrite the solution with a more robust approach to parsing and evaluating the expressions.

   - Rearranging terms, we get `7x - 98x = -296` which simplifies to `-91x = -296`.
   - Solving for `x`, we get `x = 296 / 91 ≈ 3.2527`.

2. **Second Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `x+2=2+x` simplifies to `x + 2 = 2 + x`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `x - x = 2 - 2` which simplifies to `0 = 0`.
   - This indicates infinite solutions.

3. **Third Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `3x+5=3x+2` simplifies to `3x + 5 = 3x + 2`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `3x - 3x = 2 - 5` which simplifies to `0 = -3`.
   - This indicates no solutions.

The parsing logic needs to correctly handle the coefficients and constants for both sides of the equation. Let's rewrite the solution with a more robust approach to parsing and evaluating the expressions.

### Explanation:

1. **File Reading and Writing**:
    - The program reads from `ecuatii.in` and writes to `ecuatii.out`.
    - It reads the number of equations `n` and then processes each equation one by one.

2. **Parsing Expressions**:
    - The `parseExpression` function takes an expression string and parses it to find the coefficients of `x` and the constant terms.
    - It handles both positive and negative signs and correctly identifies terms with and without `x`.

3. **Solving the Equations**:
    - For each equation, it splits the equation into left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) parts.
    - It then parses both parts to get the coefficients and constants.
    - It calculates the net coefficient of `x` and the net constant term.
    - Based on the values of these terms, it determines if the equation has a unique solution, infinite solutions, or no solution.

4. **Output**:
    - If the coefficient of `x` is zero and the constant term is also zero, the equation has infinite solutions.
    - If the coefficient of `x` is zero but the constant term is non-zero, the equation has no solution.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the solution and writes it to the output file with 4 decimal places.

This solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

The differences between the expected and found results indicate that there is a bug in the parsing or evaluation logic of the original solution. Specifically:

1. The first equation `2x-4+5x+300=98x` should yield `3.2527` but the solution returned `infinit`.
2. The second equation `x+2=2+x` should yield `infinit` but the solution returned `2.1758`.

The issue seems to be in the parsing or evaluation of the expressions, particularly in how the coefficients and constants are calculated and compared.

### Comprehensive Explanation

1. **First Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `2x-4+5x+300=98x` simplifies to `7x + 296 = 98x`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `7x - 98x = -296` which simplifies to `-91x = -296`.
   - Solving for `x`, we get `x = 296 / 91 ≈ 3.2527`.

2. **Second Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `x+2=2+x` simplifies to `x + 2 = 2 + x`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `x - x = 2 - 2` which simplifies to `0 = 0`.
   - This indicates infinite solutions.

3. **Third Equation Analysis**:
   - The equation `3x+5=3x+2` simplifies to `3x + 5 = 3x + 2`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `3x - 3x = 2 - 5` which simplifies to `0 = -3`.
   - This indicates no solutions.

The parsing logic needs to correctly handle the coefficients and constants for both sides of the equation. Let's rewrite the solution with a more robust approach to parsing and evaluating the expressions.
