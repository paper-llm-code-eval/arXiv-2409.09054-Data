La o firmă de software se lucrează la un mare proiect. Proiectul constă în executarea a $n$ ($n \in \N$) faze de dezvoltare, numerotate cu numerele $1, 2, ..., n$. Unele faze pot fi executate în paralel (în acelaşi timp), însă executarea altor faze nu poate fi începută până când nu se finalizează executarea anumitor faze.

# Cerinţă
Să se scrie un program care să se determine:
a) timpul minim $t$ în care se poate finaliza executarea proiectului
b) pentru fiecare fază $k$ ($k \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$), momentul de timp $c_k$ la care poate începe faza $k$ cel mai devreme, respectiv momentul de timp $d_k$ la care poate începe faza $k$ cel mai târziu, fără a influenţa durata totală de executare a proiectului.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `pm.in`  conţine:
- pe prima linie, un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul fazelor proiectului
- pe a doua linie, $n$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând timpul necesar finalizării fiecărei faze  
- pe fiecare linie $k$ dintre următoarele $n$ linii, un număr natural $m_k$ şi un şir $a$ format din $m_k$ numere naturale: $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m_k}$, cele $m_{k+1}$ numere din linie fiind separate prin câte un spaţiu, $m_k$ reprezentând numărul de faze ce trebuie finalizate înaintea începerii fazei $k$, iar numerele din şirul $a$ reprezentând numerele de ordine ale fazelor ce trebuie finalizate înaintea începerii fazei $k$. 

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `pm.out` va conţine $n + 1$ linii. Pe prima linie se va scrie numărul natural $t$, iar pe fiecare linie $k$ dintre următoarele $n$ linii, se vor scrie cele două numere naturale $c_k$ şi $d_k$, separate prin câte un spaţiu. 

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $0 ≤ n ≤ 100$; $n \in \N$
* Timpul necesar finalizării executării oricărei faze nu va depăşi $1\ 000\ 000$
* Se consideră că executarea proiectului începe la momentul de timp $0$
* Nu vor exista dependenţe circulare (proiectul întotdeauna se poate finaliza)
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinţei a) se acordă $40%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerinţa b) $30%$ pentru prima valoare respectiv $30%$ din punctaj pentru a doua valoare.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time required to complete all phases of the project and the earliest and latest start times for each phase. This is a classic problem of project scheduling, which can be efficiently solved using topological sorting and dynamic programming.

We'll use the following approach:

1. **Topological Sorting**: This will help us process the phases in a valid order, respecting the dependencies.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: We'll calculate the earliest and latest start times for each phase.

Here's the C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("pm.in");
    ofstream fout("pm.out");

    int n;
    fin >> n;

    vector<int> duration(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fin >> duration[i];
    }

    vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);
    vector<int> in_degree(n + 1, 0);
    vector<int> earliest_start(n + 1, 0);
    vector<int> latest_start(n + 1, 0);
    vector<int> topological_order;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int m;
        fin >> m;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            int prerequisite;
            fin >> prerequisite;
            adj[prerequisite].push_back(i);
            in_degree[i]++;
        }
    }

    // Topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm
    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (in_degree[i] == 0) {
            q.push(i);
        }
    }

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        topological_order.push_back(u);

        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            in_degree[v]--;
            if (in_degree[v] == 0) {
                q.push(v);
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate earliest start times
    for (int u : topological_order) {
        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            earliest_start[v] = max(earliest_start[v], earliest_start[u] + duration[u]);
        }
    }

    // Calculate the total time to complete the project
    int total_time = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        total_time = max(total_time, earliest_start[i] + duration[i]);
    }

    // Initialize latest start times
    fill(latest_start.begin(), latest_start.end(), total_time);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        latest_start[i] -= duration[i];
    }

    // Calculate latest start times
    reverse(topological_order.begin(), topological_order.end());
    for (int u : topological_order) {
        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            latest_start[u] = min(latest_start[u], latest_start[v] - duration[u]);
        }
    }

    // Output results
    fout << total_time << endl;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        fout << earliest_start[i] << " " << latest_start[i] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of phases `n` and the duration of each phase. Then, we read the dependencies for each phase.
2. **Topological Sorting**: We use Kahn's algorithm to perform a topological sort, which ensures that we process each phase only after all its prerequisites have been processed.
3. **Earliest Start Times**: Using dynamic programming, we calculate the earliest time each phase can start.
4. **Total Time**: The total time to complete the project is the maximum of the earliest finish times of all phases.
5. **Latest Start Times**: We initialize the latest start times to the total project time minus the duration of each phase and then adjust them using the reverse topological order.
6. **Output**: We write the total time and the earliest and latest start times for each phase to the output file.

This approach ensures efficient computation and adheres to the constraints provided.

Given that the outputs are identical, I will re-evaluate the solution and ensure it adheres to the requirements.

The provided results match the expected results exactly. However, it seems there might be some misunderstanding or a hidden issue that we need to address. Given that the outputs are identical, I will re-evaluate the solution and ensure it adheres to the requirements. Let's re-implement the solution with a fresh approach, ensuring all steps are clearly defined and correct.

### Fresh Approach:
1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of phases `n` and the duration of each phase. Read the dependencies for each phase.
2. **Topological Sorting**: Use Kahn's algorithm to perform a topological sort, ensuring each phase is processed only after all its prerequisites have been processed.
3. **Earliest Start Times**: Use dynamic programming to calculate the earliest time each phase can start.
4. **Total Time**: The total time to complete the project is the maximum of the earliest finish times of all phases.
5. **Latest Start Times**: Initialize the latest start times to the total project time minus the duration of each phase and then adjust them using the reverse topological order.
6. **Output**: Write the total time and the earliest and latest start times for each phase to the output file.
