În cel mai recent eveniment al companiei Tesla, Paul Musk a anunțat un nod produs inovativ: parcarea autonomă. Fiind cunoscut pentru lansările produselor incomplete, nici parcarea nu este completă, fiind nevoie de o automatizare pentru a atribui câte un loc mașinilor care vor să folosească parcarea.
\
Parcarea este formată din $N$ locuri, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, și este deschisă timp de $T$ secunde, începând cu secunda $1$.
Pe parcursul zilei, sosesc $M$ mașini care vor să folosească parcarea, pentru fiecare dintre acestea știindu-se timpul de sosire $s_i$ și timpul de plecare $p_i$. Mașinile vin în ordinea timpului de sosire $s_i$ și ocupă locul de parcare în intervalul de timp $[s_i, p_i]$. Pentru fiecare dintre acestea, trebuie să afișați un loc liber de parcare (dacă sunt mai multe, se poate afișa oricare) în care aceasta se poate așeza sau $−1$ dacă parcarea este plină în momentul venirii mașinii. Dacă o mașină nu are loc în parcare la timpul de sosire, aceasta nu va mai intra în parcare la niciun timp viitor.

La final, Paul este interesat de mașinile care mai sunt rămase în parcare la închiderea parcării, de aceea, vă cere să afișați configurația parcării la timpul $T$.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsesc trei numere întregi $N$, $M$ și $T$, reprezentând numărul de locuri din parcare, numărul de mașini care vin să folosească parcarea, respectiv numărul de secunde pentru care este deschisă parcarea.

Următoarele $M$ linii conțin fiecare câte două numere întregi $s_i$, $p_i$, reprezentând venirea unei mașini la secunda $s_i$ care va pleca la secunda $p_i$.

Mașinile apar în fișierul de intrare în ordine crescătoare după timpul de sosire $s_i$.

# Date de ieșire
Se vor afișa $M + 1$ linii în total, primele $M$ linii conținând fiecare câte un număr întreg între $1$ și $N$ reprezentând locul de parcare pe care îl va ocupa mașina, sau $−1$ dacă nu există niciun loc de parcare disponibil.

Ultima linie va conține $N$ numere întregi, reprezentând configurația parcării la închidere, unde cel de-al $i$-lea număr reprezintă **timpul de sosire** al mașinii de pe locul de parcare $i$, sau $−1$ dacă locul de parcare $i$ este gol.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq N, M, T \leq 200\ 000$
- $1 \leq s_i \leq T$
- $1 \leq s_i \lt p_i \leq 200\ 000$
- Considerând următoarele $2 \times M$ valori: $s_1, s_2, ..., s_M, p_1, p_2, ..., p_M$, acestea sunt distincte două câte două.
- **Dacă există mai multe soluții, se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.**
- Pentru 24 de puncte, $s_i + 1 = p_i$, adică fiecare mașină stă exact o secundă.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $p_i \gt s_j$, adică toate mașinile vin înainte ca vreo mașină să plece.
- Pentru 26 de puncte, $N \leq 1\ 000$.
- Pentru 24 de puncte, se respectă restricțiile inițiale.

        }
    }

    fout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `parcare.in`. The first line contains the number of parking spots \(N\), the number of cars \(M\), and the total time \(T\).
2. **Storing Car Information**: Each car's arrival and departure times are stored in a `Car` structure, along with its index.
3. **Sorting Cars**: The cars are sorted based on their arrival times.
4. **Tracking Available Spots**: A set is used to keep track of available parking spots. Initially, all spots are available.
5. **Assigning Parking Spots**: For each car, we first free up any spots that have become available (i.e., cars that have departed). Then, if there are any available spots, the car is assigned the first available spot.
6. **Output**: The results are written to the file `parcare.out`. The first \(M\) lines contain the parking spot assigned to each car (or `-1` if no spot was available). The last line contains the configuration of the parking lot at the end of the day.

This solution ensures efficient handling of the parking lot with a time complexity of \(O(M \log N)\) due to the sorting and set operations, which is suitable given the constraints.

The primary issue with the previous solution stems from the handling of parking spot allocation and the freeing up of spots. The solution needs to ensure that cars are assigned the correct parking spots and that these spots are freed up correctly when cars depart.

Here's a revised solution that addresses the issues:

1. **Use a priority queue to manage the parking spots efficiently**.
2. **Track the departure times to free up spots correctly**.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

struct Car {
    int arrival;
    int departure;
    int index;
};

struct CompareDeparture {
    bool operator()(const Car &a, const Car &b) {
        return a.departure > b.departure;
    }
};

int main() {
    ifstream fin("parcare.in");
    ofstream fout("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    fin >> N >> M >> T;

    vector<Car> cars(M);
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        fin >> cars[i].arrival >> cars[i].departure;
        cars[i].index = i;
    }

    vector<int> result(M, -1);
    vector<int> parking(N, -1); // -1 means the parking spot is empty
    priority_queue<Car, vector<Car>, CompareDeparture> pq;
    set<int> availableSpots;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        availableSpots.insert(i);
    }

    for (const auto &car : cars) {
        // Free up spots that are now available
        while (!pq.empty() && pq.top().departure < car.arrival) {
            availableSpots.insert(pq.top().index);
            pq.pop();
        }

        if (!availableSpots.empty()) {
            int spot = *availableSpots.begin();
            availableSpots.erase(availableSpots.begin());
            parking[spot] = car.index;
            result[car.index] = spot + 1; // +1 to convert 0-based index to 1-based
            pq.push({car.arrival, car.departure, spot});
        }
    }

    for (const auto &res : result) {
        fout << res << "\n";
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (parking[i] != -1) {
            fout << cars[parking[i]].arrival << " ";
        } else {
            fout << -1 << " ";
        }
    }

    fout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The primary issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly handle the allocation and deallocation of parking spots. Specifically, it does not correctly free up spots when cars leave. This can lead to incorrect assignments and an incorrect final state of the parking lot.

Let's fix this by ensuring that:
1. We correctly free up parking spots when cars leave.
2. We correctly track the final state of the parking lot.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Car {
    int arrival;
    int departure;

    int type; // 1 for arrival, -1 for departure
    int carIndex;
};

bool compareEvent(const Event &a, const Event &b) {
    if (a.time == b.time) return a.type > b.type; // Departure events should come before arrival events if they are at the same time
    return a.time < b.time;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("parcare.in");
    ofstream fout("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    fin >> N >> M >> T;

    vector<Car> cars(M);
    vector<Event> events;
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        fin >> cars[i].arrival >> cars[i].departure;
        cars[i].index = i;
        events.push_back({cars[i].arrival, 1, i});
        events.push_back({cars[i].departure, -1, i});
    }

    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), compareEvent);

    vector<int> result(M, -1);
    vector<int> parking(N, -1); // -1 means the parking spot is empty
    set<int> availableSpots;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        availableSpots.insert(i);
    }

    for (const auto &event : events) {
        if (event.type == 1) { // Arrival
            if (!availableSpots.empty()) {
                int spot = *availableSpots.begin();
                availableSpots.erase(availableSpots.begin());
                parking[spot] = event.carIndex;
                result[event.carIndex] = spot + 1; // +1 to convert 0-based index to 1-based
            }
        } else { // Departure
            for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
                if (parking[i] == event.carIndex) {
                    parking[i] = -1;
                    availableSpots.insert(i);
                    break;
                }

        }

        }
    }

    fout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `parcare.in`. The first line contains the number of parking spots \(N\), the number of cars \(M\), and the total time \(T\).
2. **Storing Car Information**: Each car's arrival and departure times are stored in a `Car` structure, along with its index.
3. **Creating Events**: For each car, we create two events: one for arrival and one for departure.
4. **Sorting Events**: Events are sorted by time. If two events have the same time, departure events come before arrival events.
5. **Tracking Available Spots**: A set is used to keep track of available parking spots. Initially, all spots are available.
6. **Processing Events**: We process each event in order:
   - For arrival events, if there are available spots, we assign the car to the first available spot.
   - For departure events, we free up the spot occupied by the car.
7. **Output**: The results are written to the file `parcare.out`. The first \(M\) lines contain the parking spot assigned to each car (or `-1` if no spot was available). The last line contains the configuration of the parking lot at the end of the day.

This solution ensures that parking spots are managed correctly and efficiently, addressing the issues found in the previous implementation.

The error message indicates that the `sort` function is not recognized. This is because the `algorithm` header, which contains the `sort` function, was not included in the program. Let's include the necessary headers and ensure the program compiles correctly.

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Include the `algorithm` Header**: The `algorithm` header is necessary for the `sort` function. Including this header resolves the compilation error.
2. **Ensure Correct Handling of Events**: The logic for processing arrival and departure events remains the same, ensuring that parking spots are correctly allocated and freed.

This revised solution should compile correctly and produce the expected output.

    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (parking[i] != -1) {
            fout << cars[parking[i]].arrival << " ";
        } else {
            fout << -1 << " ";

    }

    fout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `parcare.in`. The first line contains the number of parking spots \(N\), the number of cars \(M\), and the total time \(T\).
2. **Storing Car Information**: Each car's arrival and departure times are stored in a `Car` structure, along with its index.
3. **Creating Events**: For each car, we create two events: one for arrival and one for departure.
4. **Sorting Events**: Events are sorted by time. If two events have the same time, departure events come before arrival events.
5. **Tracking Available Spots**: A set is used to keep track of available parking spots. Initially, all spots are available.
6. **Processing Events**: We process each event in order:
   - For arrival events, if there are available spots, we assign the car to the first available spot.
   - For departure events, we free up the spot occupied by the car.
7. **Output**: The results are written to the file `parcare.out`. The first \(M\) lines contain the parking spot assigned to each car (or `-1` if no spot was available). The last line contains the configuration of the parking lot at the end of the day.

This solution ensures that parking spots are managed correctly and efficiently, addressing the issues found in the previous implementation.

The error message indicates that the `sort` function is not recognized. This is because the `algorithm` header, which contains the `sort` function, was not included in the program. Let's include the necessary headers and ensure the program compiles correctly.

Here is the corrected solution with the necessary fixes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm> // Include this for the sort function

using namespace std;

struct Car {
    int arrival;
    int departure;
    int index;
};

struct Event {
    int time;
    int type; // 1 for arrival, -1 for departure
    int carIndex;
};

bool compareEvent(const Event &a, const Event &b) {
    if (a.time == b.time) return a.type > b.type; // Departure events should come before arrival events if they are at the same time
    return a.time < b.time;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("parcare.in");
    ofstream fout("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    fin >> N >> M >> T;

    vector<Car> cars(M);
    vector<Event> events;
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        fin >> cars[i].arrival >> cars[i].departure;
        cars[i].index = i;
        events.push_back({cars[i].arrival, 1, i});
        events.push_back({cars[i].departure, -1, i});
    }

    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), compareEvent);

    vector<int> result(M, -1);
    vector<int> parking(N, -1); // -1 means the parking spot is empty
    set<int> availableSpots;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        availableSpots.insert(i);
    }

    for (const auto &event : events) {
        if (event.type == 1) { // Arrival
            if (!availableSpots.empty()) {
                int spot = *availableSpots.begin();
                availableSpots.erase(availableSpots.begin());
                parking[spot] = event.carIndex;
                result[event.carIndex] = spot + 1; // +1 to convert 0-based index to 1-based
            }
        } else { // Departure
            for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
                if (parking[i] == event.carIndex) {
                    parking[i] = -1;
                    availableSpots.insert(i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (const auto &res : result) {
        fout << res << "\n";
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (parking[i] != -1) {
            fout << cars[parking[i]].arrival << " ";
        } else {
            fout << -1 << " ";
        }
    }

    fout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Include the `algorithm` Header**: The `algorithm` header is necessary for the `sort` function. Including this header resolves the compilation error.
2. **Ensure Correct Handling of Events**: The logic for processing arrival and departure events remains the same, ensuring that parking spots are correctly allocated and freed.

This revised solution should compile correctly and produce the expected output.

The primary issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly handle the allocation and deallocation of parking spots. Specifically, it does not correctly free up spots when cars leave. This can lead to incorrect assignments and an incorrect final state of the parking lot.

Let's fix this by ensuring that:
1. We correctly free up parking spots when cars leave.
2. We correctly track the final state of the parking lot.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm> // Include this for the sort function

using namespace std;

struct Car {
    int arrival;
    int departure;
    int index;
};

struct Event {
    int time;
    int type; // 1 for arrival, -1 for departure
    int carIndex;
};

bool compareEvent(const Event &a, const Event &b) {
    if (a.time == b.time) return a.type > b.type; // Departure events should come before arrival events if they are at the same time
    return a.time < b.time;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("parcare.in");
    ofstream fout("parcare.out");

    int N, M, T;
    fin >> N >> M >> T;

    vector<Car> cars(M);
    vector<Event> events;
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        fin >> cars[i].arrival >> cars[i].departure;
        cars[i].index = i;
        events.push_back({cars[i].arrival, 1, i});
        events.push_back({cars[i].departure, -1, i});
    }

    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), compareEvent);

    vector<int> result(M, -1);
    vector<int> parking(N, -1); // -1 means the parking spot is empty
    set<int> availableSpots;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        availableSpots.insert(i);
    }

    for (const auto &event : events) {
        if (event.type == 1) { // Arrival
            if (!availableSpots.empty()) {
                int spot = *availableSpots.begin();
                availableSpots.erase(availableSpots.begin());
                parking[spot] = event.carIndex;
                result[event.carIndex] = spot + 1; // +1 to convert 0-based index to 1-based
            }
        } else { // Departure
            for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
                if (parking[i] == event.carIndex) {
                    parking[i] = -1;
                    availableSpots.insert(i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (const auto &res : result) {
        fout << res << "\n";
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (parking[i] != -1) {
            fout << cars[parking[i]].arrival << " ";
        } else {
            fout << -1 << " ";
