Se consideră o matrice pătratică de dimensiune $N$, conţinând numere naturale. Numim **cruce de lăţime $K$** reuniunea mulțimii tuturor elementelor aflate pe $K$ linii consecutive ale matricei și a mulțimii tuturor elementelor aflate pe $K$ coloane consecutive ale matricei. Două elemente ale matricei se consideră distincte dacă sunt situate pe poziții distincte în matrice. Se acceptă şi forma degenerată a unei cruci, în formă de `T` sau `L`, când una dintre liniile sau coloanele care formează crucea sunt chiar la marginea matricei. Vom defini **valoarea** unei cruci ca fiind suma elementelor din care aceasta este formată.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, pentru o valoare $K$ dată, determină o cruce de lățime $K$ a cărei valoare este maximă și poziția ei în matrice. Această poziție va fi exprimată prin perechea de indici reprezentând prima linie din cele $K$ consecutive și prima coloană din cele $K$ consecutive din care este formată crucea.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `cruce.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $N$ şi $K$, iar pe următoarele $N$ linii câte $N$ numere întregi reprezentând în ordine, pe linii, elementele matricei. Numerele de pe aceeaşi linie sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `cruce.out` va conţine trei numere $Vmax \ L \ C$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând valoarea maximă determinată pentru o cruce de lățime $K$, respectiv linia și coloana care exprimă poziția acesteia în matrice.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq K < N \leq 500$;
* Numerele din matrice sunt din intervalul $[-5 \ 000, 5 \ 000]$
* Liniile şi coloanele se indexează începând cu 1.
* Dacă există mai multe cruci de lățime $K$ de valoare maximă, se va lua în considerare poziția cu indicele liniei mai mic, iar în caz de egalitate a liniilor poziția celei cu indicele coloanei mai mic.

1 -2 3 -1 4
-3 2 2 -2 -1
1 2 3 4 5

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to calculate the sum of elements in all possible crosses of width \( K \) in an \( N \times N \) matrix. Given the constraints, we need to ensure our solution is optimized to handle the worst-case scenario.

### Approach

1. **Reading Input Efficiently**: We'll use file I/O to read the input and output the result.
2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We'll use a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any submatrix. This will help us in efficiently computing the sum of elements in the required crosses.
3. **Iterate Over Possible Crosses**: For each possible starting position of a cross, calculate its value using the prefix sum array.
4. **Track Maximum Value**: Keep track of the maximum value and its position as we iterate through all possible crosses.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - Construct a 2D prefix sum array `prefix` where `prefix[i][j]` contains the sum of elements from the top-left corner `(1, 1)` to `(i, j)`.
   - This allows us to compute the sum of any submatrix in constant time.

2. **Calculate Cross Value**:
   - For each possible top-left corner of a cross, calculate the sum of the elements in the cross using the prefix sum array.
   - Handle the overlap between the rows and columns in the cross properly to avoid double-counting.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Use nested loops to iterate over all possible starting positions of the cross.
   - For each position, compute the cross value and update the maximum value and its position if the current cross value is higher.

Here's the C++ code implementing the above approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cruce.in");
    std::ofstream out("cruce.out");

    int N, K;
    in >> N >> K;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(N + 1, std::vector<int>(N + 1));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> prefix(N + 1, std::vector<int>(N + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
            in >> matrix[i][j];
            prefix[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + prefix[i - 1][j] + prefix[i][j - 1] - prefix[i - 1][j - 1];
        }
    }

    int Vmax = -25000000, L = 0, C = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= N - K + 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= N - K + 1; ++j) {
            int rowSum = prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - prefix[i - 1][j + K - 1] - prefix[i + K - 1][j - 1] + prefix[i - 1][j - 1];
            int colSum = prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - prefix[i + K - 1][j - 1] - prefix[i - 1][j + K - 1] + prefix[i - 1][j - 1];
            int overlap = prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] + prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1];
            int crossSum = rowSum + colSum - overlap;

            if (crossSum > Vmax) {
                Vmax = crossSum;
                L = i;
                C = j;
            }
        }
    }

    out << Vmax << " " << L << " " << C << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We construct the prefix sum array where each element at `(i, j)` contains the sum of the submatrix from `(1, 1)` to `(i, j)`.
- **Cross Sum Calculation**: For each possible top-left corner of the cross, we calculate the sum of the cross by combining the sums of the rows and columns and subtracting the overlap.
- **Tracking Maximum**: We keep track of the maximum cross sum and its position as we iterate through all possible crosses.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the cross sums and find the maximum value in a time complexity of \( O(N^2) \), which is optimal for the given constraints.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. The issue lies in the way the cross sum is calculated. Specifically, the overlap between the rows and columns in the cross needs to be handled correctly to avoid double-counting.

Let's break down the problem again and ensure we handle the overlap correctly.

1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - Construct a 2D prefix sum array `prefix` where `prefix[i][j]` contains the sum of elements from the top-left corner `(1, 1)` to `(i, j)`.
   - This allows us to compute the sum of any submatrix in constant time.

            }

            // Subtract the overlap (top-left KxK submatrix)
            int overlap = prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - (i > 1 ? prefix[i - 1][j + K - 1] : 0)

### Explanation

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We construct the prefix sum array where each element at `(i, j)` contains the sum of the submatrix from `(1, 1)` to `(i, j)`.
- **Cross Sum Calculation**: For each possible top-left corner of the cross, we calculate the sum of the cross by combining the sums of the rows and columns and subtracting the overlap.
- **Tracking Maximum**: We keep track of the maximum cross sum and its position as we iterate through all possible crosses.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the cross sums and find the maximum value in a time complexity of \( O(N^2) \), which is optimal for the given constraints. This should now correctly handle the example input provided and produce the expected output.

Thank you for your patience. The issue lies in the way we are calculating the cross sum. Specifically, the overlap between the rows and columns in the cross needs to be handled correctly to avoid double-counting.

### Problem Review

We need to find the maximum value of a cross of width \( K \) in an \( N \times N \) matrix. A cross of width \( K \) includes:
- \( K \) consecutive rows.
- \( K \) consecutive columns.
- The overlap between these rows and columns should be subtracted to avoid double-counting.

### Correct Approach

1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - Construct a 2D prefix sum array `prefix` where `prefix[i][j]` contains the sum of elements from the top-left corner `(1, 1)` to `(i, j)`.
   - This allows us to compute the sum of any submatrix in constant time.

2. **Calculate Cross Value**:
   - For each possible top-left corner of a cross, calculate its value using the prefix sum array.
   - Handle the overlap between the rows and columns in the cross properly to avoid double-counting.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - Construct the prefix sum array.
   
2. **Iterate Over Possible Crosses**:
   - For each possible starting position of a cross, calculate its value using the prefix sum array.
   - Correctly handle the overlap between the rows and columns.

3. **Track Maximum Value**:
   - Keep track of the maximum value and its position as we iterate through all possible crosses.

Let's rewrite the solution with these steps in mind:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream in("cruce.in");
    std::ofstream out("cruce.out");

    int N, K;
    in >> N >> K;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(N + 1, std::vector<int>(N + 1));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> prefix(N + 1, std::vector<int>(N + 1, 0));

    // Read the matrix and compute the prefix sum array
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
            in >> matrix[i][j];
            prefix[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + prefix[i - 1][j] + prefix[i][j - 1] - prefix[i - 1][j - 1];
        }
    }

    int Vmax = -25000000, L = 0, C = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= N - K + 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= N - K + 1; ++j) {
            // Sum of K rows starting at (i, j)
            int rowSum = prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - (i > 1 ? prefix[i - 1][j + K - 1] : 0) - (j > 1 ? prefix[i + K - 1][j - 1] : 0) + (i > 1 && j > 1 ? prefix[i - 1][j - 1] : 0);

            // Sum of K columns starting at (i, j)
            int colSum = prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - (i > 1 ? prefix[i + K - 1][j - 1] : 0) - (j > 1 ? prefix[i - 1][j + K - 1] : 0) + (i > 1 && j > 1 ? prefix[i - 1][j - 1] : 0);

            // Subtract the overlap (top-left KxK submatrix)
            int overlap = prefix[i + K - 1][j + K - 1] - (i > 1 ? prefix[i - 1][j + K - 1] : 0) - (j > 1 ? prefix[i + K - 1][j - 1] : 0) + (i > 1 && j > 1 ? prefix[i - 1][j - 1] : 0);

            int crossSum = rowSum + colSum - overlap;

            if (crossSum > Vmax) {
                Vmax = crossSum;
                L = i;
                C = j;
            }
        }
    }

    out << Vmax << " " << L << " " << C << "\n";

    return 0;
}
