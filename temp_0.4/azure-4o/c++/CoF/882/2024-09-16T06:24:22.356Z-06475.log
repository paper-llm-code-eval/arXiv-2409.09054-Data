Dorel și-a achiziționat o fermă cu $n$ plantații și o mașină de transport cu o capacitate $c$, pentru transportul de îngrășăminte la toate plantațiile. Îngrășămintele se află într-un depozit, în cantitate suficientă pentru scopul propus. Plantațiile și depozitul sunt dispuse sub forma unui cerc. Există drumuri doar între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$ ($1 \leq i \leq n-1$), precum și între depozit și plantația $1$ și depozit și plantația $n$, ca în figură. La o plantație $i$ se poate ajunge de la depozit trecând prin plantațiile $1, 2, \dots, i-1$ sau prin plantațiile $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$, alegerea făcându-se în funcție de traseul cel mai scurt. Se cunosc aceste distanțe, precum și cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru fiecare plantație. La fiecare încărcare, Dorel ia din depozit exact cantitatea $c$. 

Dorel vrea să-și organizeze bine munca la fermă și să consume cât mai puțină benzină prin **alegerea celor mai scurte trasee de parcurs**. Plantațiile trebuie să fie aprovizionate **obligatoriu** în ordinea următoare: mai întâi plantația $1$, apoi plantația $2$, plantația $3$, $\dots$, plantația $n$. În plus, și-a propus să încarce o nouă cantitate de îngrășământ doar după ce a folosit toată cantitatea încărcată anterior. Transportarea îngrășămintelor pe plantații se face deci, începând cu plantația $1$. După ce se transportă toată cantitatea necesară pentru această plantație, se trece la plantația $2$, și tot așa în ordine la $3, 4$ etc. până se deservește ultima plantație. Dacă după ce s-au transportat îngrășămintele necesare pentru plantația $i$ în mașină au mai rămas încă îngrășăminte, acestea trebuie utilizate în continuare pentru alte plantații, alese în ordinea impusă (începând cu plantația $i+1$, apoi $i+2$ etc.), până se epuizează toată cantitatea transportată de mașină. Astfel, dacă de la plantația $i$ trebuie să ajungă la plantația $i+1$, va alege cel mai scurt traseu dintre traseul direct de la plantația $i$ la $i+1$ și traseul care trece prin plantațiile $i-1$, $i-2$, $\dots$, $1$, depozit, $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$. La final, mașina trebuie să se întoarcă la depozit, goală sau cu cantitatea rămasă după aprovizionarea cu îngrășăminte a plantației $n$.


# Cerință

Ajutați-l pe Dorel să calculeze distanța parcursă pentru a transporta îngrășăminte la toate cele $n$ plantații, conform cerințelor.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `fermier.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $n$ și $c$, separate printr-un spațiu. A doua linie conține numerele naturale $d_0, d_1, d_2, \dots, d_{n-1}, d_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, unde $d_0$ este distanța dintre prima plantație și depozit, $d_i$ este distanța între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$, iar $d_n$ este distanța dintre plantația $n$ și depozit. Pe linia a treia se găsesc numerele naturale $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n-1}, q_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, $q_i$ reprezentând cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru plantația $i$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `fermier.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $1 \leq n \leq 2$, pentru teste în valoare de $20$ de puncte;
* $1 \leq d_i, c, q_i \leq 1 \ 000$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here's the C++ solution for the given problem. This code reads from `fermier.in` and writes to `fermier.out` without using `cin`, `cout`, `scanf`, or `printf`.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("fermier.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("fermier.out");

    int n, c;
    infile >> n >> c;

    std::vector<int> distances(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        infile >> distances[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> quantities(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> quantities[i];
    }

    int total_distance = 0;
    int remaining_capacity = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (remaining_capacity < quantities[i]) {
            // Need to go back to the depot to refill
            total_distance += distances[i + 1] + distances[0];
            remaining_capacity = c;
        }
        
        // Deliver the required quantity
        remaining_capacity -= quantities[i];
        
        // Move to the next plantation
        if (i < n - 1) {
            total_distance += distances[i + 1];
        }
    }

    // Return to the depot from the last plantation
    total_distance += distances[n];

    outfile << total_distance << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of plantations `n` and the capacity `c` from the input file. It then reads the distances and the quantities of fertilizers required for each plantation.
2. **Calculating Total Distance**:
    - The code iterates through each plantation, checking if the remaining capacity is sufficient to deliver the required quantity.
    - If the remaining capacity is insufficient, the truck returns to the depot to refill.
    - The truck then delivers the required quantity and moves to the next plantation.
3. **Returning to Depot**: After delivering to the last plantation, the truck returns to the depot.
4. **Output**: The total distance traveled by the truck is written to the output file.

This approach ensures that Dorel uses the shortest path to minimize the distance traveled while adhering to the constraints of delivering fertilizers in the given order.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the initial approach did not correctly account for the shortest path calculations and the proper use of remaining capacity. Let's re-evaluate the problem and correct the approach.

### Analysis
1. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
    - The truck can either move directly to the next plantation or return to the depot and go to the next plantation.
    - The shortest path must be calculated correctly for each transition between plantations.

2. **Capacity Management**:
    - The truck should only return to the depot when it runs out of capacity.
    - The truck should continue to the next plantation if it has enough remaining capacity.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Initialization**:
    - Read the input values.
    - Initialize variables for total distance and remaining capacity.

2. **Processing Each Plantation**:
    - For each plantation, check if the remaining capacity is sufficient.
    - If not, calculate the distance to return to the depot and refill.
    - Calculate the shortest path to the next plantation considering both direct and via-depot routes.
    - Update the total distance and remaining capacity accordingly.

3. **Final Return to Depot**:
    - After servicing the last plantation, return to the depot.

### Corrected Solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("fermier.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("fermier.out");

    int n, c;
    infile >> n >> c;

    std::vector<int> distances(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        infile >> distances[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> quantities(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> quantities[i];
    }

    int total_distance = 0;
    int remaining_capacity = c;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (remaining_capacity < quantities[i]) {
            // Need to go back to the depot to refill
            total_distance += distances[i] + distances[0];
            remaining_capacity = c;
        }
        
        // Deliver the required quantity
        remaining_capacity -= quantities[i];
        
        // Move to the next plantation
        if (i < n - 1) {
            // Calculate the shortest path to the next plantation
            int direct_distance = distances[i + 1];
            int via_depot_distance = distances[i + 1] + distances[0] + distances[n];
            total_distance += std::min(direct_distance, via_depot_distance);
        }
    }

    // Return to the depot from the last plantation
    total_distance += distances[n];

    outfile << total_distance << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
    - The code now correctly calculates the shortest path between each plantation by comparing the direct distance and the via-depot distance.

2. **Capacity Management**:
    - The code ensures that the truck returns to the depot only when the remaining capacity is insufficient to service the next plantation.

3. **Final Return to Depot**:
    - The code correctly adds the distance to return to the depot after servicing the last plantation.

By making these adjustments, the solution should now correctly calculate the total distance traveled by the truck, adhering to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem.

                }

    }

    // Return to the depot from the last plantation
    total_distance += distances[current_position] + distances[0];

    outfile << total_distance << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
    - The code now correctly calculates the shortest path between each plantation by comparing the direct distance and the via-depot distance.

2. **Capacity Management**:
    - The code ensures that the truck returns to the depot only when the remaining capacity is insufficient to service the next plantation.
    - The truck continues to the next plantation if it has enough remaining capacity.

3. **Order of Operations**:
    - The truck services plantations in the given order.
    - The truck returns to the depot only when it runs out of capacity and not prematurely.

By making these adjustments, the solution should now correctly calculate the total distance traveled by the truck, adhering to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem.

The discrepancy indicates that the logic for determining the shortest path and managing the capacity is not correctly implemented. Let's break down the problem and approach it step by step to ensure correctness.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
    - The truck can move directly to the next plantation or return to the depot and go to the next plantation.
    - The shortest path must be calculated correctly for each transition between plantations.

2. **Capacity Management**:
    - The truck should only return to the depot when it runs out of capacity.
    - The truck should continue to the next plantation if it has enough remaining capacity.

3. **Order of Operations**:
    - The truck should service plantations in the given order.
    - The truck should only return to the depot when it runs out of capacity and not prematurely.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Initialization**:
    - Read the input values.
    - Initialize variables for total distance and remaining capacity.

2. **Processing Each Plantation**:
    - For each plantation, check if the remaining capacity is sufficient.
    - If not, calculate the distance to return to the depot and refill.
    - Calculate the shortest path to the next plantation considering both direct and via-depot routes.
    - Update the total distance and remaining capacity accordingly.

3. **Final Return to Depot**:
    - After servicing the last plantation, return to the depot.
