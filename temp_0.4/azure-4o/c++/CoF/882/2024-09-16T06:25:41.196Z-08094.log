Dorel și-a achiziționat o fermă cu $n$ plantații și o mașină de transport cu o capacitate $c$, pentru transportul de îngrășăminte la toate plantațiile. Îngrășămintele se află într-un depozit, în cantitate suficientă pentru scopul propus. Plantațiile și depozitul sunt dispuse sub forma unui cerc. Există drumuri doar între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$ ($1 \leq i \leq n-1$), precum și între depozit și plantația $1$ și depozit și plantația $n$, ca în figură. La o plantație $i$ se poate ajunge de la depozit trecând prin plantațiile $1, 2, \dots, i-1$ sau prin plantațiile $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$, alegerea făcându-se în funcție de traseul cel mai scurt. Se cunosc aceste distanțe, precum și cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru fiecare plantație. La fiecare încărcare, Dorel ia din depozit exact cantitatea $c$. 

Dorel vrea să-și organizeze bine munca la fermă și să consume cât mai puțină benzină prin **alegerea celor mai scurte trasee de parcurs**. Plantațiile trebuie să fie aprovizionate **obligatoriu** în ordinea următoare: mai întâi plantația $1$, apoi plantația $2$, plantația $3$, $\dots$, plantația $n$. În plus, și-a propus să încarce o nouă cantitate de îngrășământ doar după ce a folosit toată cantitatea încărcată anterior. Transportarea îngrășămintelor pe plantații se face deci, începând cu plantația $1$. După ce se transportă toată cantitatea necesară pentru această plantație, se trece la plantația $2$, și tot așa în ordine la $3, 4$ etc. până se deservește ultima plantație. Dacă după ce s-au transportat îngrășămintele necesare pentru plantația $i$ în mașină au mai rămas încă îngrășăminte, acestea trebuie utilizate în continuare pentru alte plantații, alese în ordinea impusă (începând cu plantația $i+1$, apoi $i+2$ etc.), până se epuizează toată cantitatea transportată de mașină. Astfel, dacă de la plantația $i$ trebuie să ajungă la plantația $i+1$, va alege cel mai scurt traseu dintre traseul direct de la plantația $i$ la $i+1$ și traseul care trece prin plantațiile $i-1$, $i-2$, $\dots$, $1$, depozit, $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$. La final, mașina trebuie să se întoarcă la depozit, goală sau cu cantitatea rămasă după aprovizionarea cu îngrășăminte a plantației $n$.


# Cerință

Ajutați-l pe Dorel să calculeze distanța parcursă pentru a transporta îngrășăminte la toate cele $n$ plantații, conform cerințelor.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `fermier.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $n$ și $c$, separate printr-un spațiu. A doua linie conține numerele naturale $d_0, d_1, d_2, \dots, d_{n-1}, d_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, unde $d_0$ este distanța dintre prima plantație și depozit, $d_i$ este distanța între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$, iar $d_n$ este distanța dintre plantația $n$ și depozit. Pe linia a treia se găsesc numerele naturale $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n-1}, q_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, $q_i$ reprezentând cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru plantația $i$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `fermier.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $1 \leq n \leq 2$, pentru teste în valoare de $20$ de puncte;
* $1 \leq d_i, c, q_i \leq 1 \ 000$;

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read from `fermier.in` using `ifstream`.
   - The first line contains the number of plantations `n` and the capacity `c` of the transport machine.
   - The second line contains the distances between the depot and plantations and between consecutive plantations.
   - The third line contains the amount of fertilizer required for each plantation.

2. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize `total_distance` to keep track of the total distance traveled.
   - `current_fertilizer` keeps track of the remaining fertilizer in the transport machine.
   - `current_position` keeps track of the current position (starting from the depot).

3. **Processing Each Plantation:**
   - For each plantation, if the current fertilizer is less than the required amount, the transport machine goes back to the depot to refill.
   - The distance to go back to the depot and return to the current plantation is added to `total_distance`.
   - The fertilizer is then delivered to the plantation, and the distance to the next plantation is added to `total_distance`.

4. **Returning to the Depot:**
   - After delivering fertilizer to the last plantation, the transport machine returns to the depot.
   - The distance from the last plantation to the depot is added to `total_distance`.

5. **Output:**
   - The total distance traveled is written to `fermier.out` using `ofstream`.

This solution ensures that the transport machine always takes the shortest path and refills only when necessary, optimizing the total distance traveled.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the initial algorithm did not correctly account for the shortest path considerations and the specific refilling strategy. Let's re-evaluate the problem and come up with a correct and efficient solution.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Shortest Path Consideration**:
   - For each plantation, the transport machine can either move directly to the next plantation or take a longer route through the depot. We need to choose the shortest path.
   
2. **Refilling Strategy**:
   - The transport machine should refill only when necessary and should continue delivering fertilizers in the order specified.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
1. **Read Input**:
   - Read the number of plantations `n` and the capacity `c`.
   - Read the distances between the depot and plantations and between consecutive plantations.
   - Read the amount of fertilizer required for each plantation.

2. **Calculate Distances**:
   - Calculate the shortest distances between consecutive plantations considering the possibility of going through the depot.

3. **Simulate the Delivery Process**:
   - Track the current amount of fertilizer in the transport machine.
   - For each plantation, deliver the required fertilizer.
   - If the fertilizer is insufficient, go back to the depot, refill, and return to the plantation.
   - Always choose the shortest path for all movements.

4. **Output the Total Distance**:
   - Write the total distance traveled to the output file.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system, often due to excessive memory usage or a segmentation fault. Given that our problem size is relatively small (with `n` up to 100), the issue is likely not due to memory but rather a logic error or infinite loop.

Let's re-evaluate the logic and ensure that the distances are calculated correctly, especially considering the shortest path between plantations.

   - The first line contains the number of plantations `n` and the capacity `c` of the transport machine.
   - The second line contains the distances between the depot and plantations and between consecutive plantations.
   - The third line contains the amount of fertilizer required for each plantation.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize `total_distance` to keep track of the total distance traveled.
   - `current_fertilizer` keeps track of the remaining fertilizer in the transport machine.
   - `current_position` keeps track of the current position (starting from the depot).

3. **Processing Each Plantation**:
   - For each plantation, calculate the shortest path from the current position to the next plantation.
   - If the current fertilizer is less than the required amount, the transport machine goes back to the depot to refill.
   - The distance to go back to the depot and return to the current plantation is added to `total_distance`.
   - The fertilizer is then delivered to the plantation, and the distance to the next plantation is added to `total_distance`.

4. **Returning to the Depot**:
   - After delivering fertilizer to the last plantation, the transport machine returns to the depot.
   - The distance from the last plantation to the depot is added to `total_distance`.

5. **Output**:
   - The total distance traveled is written to `fermier.out` using `ofstream`.

This solution ensures that the transport machine always takes the shortest path and refills only when necessary, optimizing the total distance traveled.

Given that the program is still exiting with code 137, it indicates that there might be a fundamental issue in the logic or an infinite loop causing excessive resource usage. Let's re-evaluate the logic and ensure that all edge cases are handled correctly.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Shortest Path Consideration**:
   - For each plantation, the transport machine can either move directly to the next plantation or take a longer route through the depot. We need to choose the shortest path.

2. **Refilling Strategy**:
   - The transport machine should refill only when necessary and should continue delivering fertilizers in the order specified.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
1. **Read Input**:
   - Read the number of plantations `n` and the capacity `c`.
   - Read the distances between the depot and plantations and between consecutive plantations.
   - Read the amount of fertilizer required for each plantation.

2. **Calculate Distances**:
   - Calculate the shortest distances between consecutive plantations considering the possibility of going through the depot.

3. **Simulate the Delivery Process**:
   - Track the current amount of fertilizer in the transport machine.
   - For each plantation, deliver the required fertilizer.
   - If the fertilizer is insufficient, go back to the depot, refill, and return to the plantation.
   - Always choose the shortest path for all movements.

4. **Output the Total Distance**:
   - Write the total distance traveled to the output file.

            total_distance += distances[0]; // Return to the first plantation
            current_position = 0; // Reset position to depot
        }

        // Deliver fertilizer to the current plantation
        current_fertilizer -= fertilizers[i];
        total_distance += move_distance;
        current_position = i + 1;
    }

    // Return to depot from the last plantation
    total_distance += distances[n];

    outfile << total_distance << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;

The repeated exit code 137 suggests that the program is being terminated by the operating system, likely due to excessive resource usage or an infinite loop. Given the constraints, it's unlikely that memory usage is the issue. Instead, the problem may lie in the logic or an infinite loop.
