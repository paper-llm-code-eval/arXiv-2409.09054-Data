Dorel și-a achiziționat o fermă cu $n$ plantații și o mașină de transport cu o capacitate $c$, pentru transportul de îngrășăminte la toate plantațiile. Îngrășămintele se află într-un depozit, în cantitate suficientă pentru scopul propus. Plantațiile și depozitul sunt dispuse sub forma unui cerc. Există drumuri doar între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$ ($1 \leq i \leq n-1$), precum și între depozit și plantația $1$ și depozit și plantația $n$, ca în figură. La o plantație $i$ se poate ajunge de la depozit trecând prin plantațiile $1, 2, \dots, i-1$ sau prin plantațiile $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$, alegerea făcându-se în funcție de traseul cel mai scurt. Se cunosc aceste distanțe, precum și cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru fiecare plantație. La fiecare încărcare, Dorel ia din depozit exact cantitatea $c$. 

Dorel vrea să-și organizeze bine munca la fermă și să consume cât mai puțină benzină prin **alegerea celor mai scurte trasee de parcurs**. Plantațiile trebuie să fie aprovizionate **obligatoriu** în ordinea următoare: mai întâi plantația $1$, apoi plantația $2$, plantația $3$, $\dots$, plantația $n$. În plus, și-a propus să încarce o nouă cantitate de îngrășământ doar după ce a folosit toată cantitatea încărcată anterior. Transportarea îngrășămintelor pe plantații se face deci, începând cu plantația $1$. După ce se transportă toată cantitatea necesară pentru această plantație, se trece la plantația $2$, și tot așa în ordine la $3, 4$ etc. până se deservește ultima plantație. Dacă după ce s-au transportat îngrășămintele necesare pentru plantația $i$ în mașină au mai rămas încă îngrășăminte, acestea trebuie utilizate în continuare pentru alte plantații, alese în ordinea impusă (începând cu plantația $i+1$, apoi $i+2$ etc.), până se epuizează toată cantitatea transportată de mașină. Astfel, dacă de la plantația $i$ trebuie să ajungă la plantația $i+1$, va alege cel mai scurt traseu dintre traseul direct de la plantația $i$ la $i+1$ și traseul care trece prin plantațiile $i-1$, $i-2$, $\dots$, $1$, depozit, $n, n-1, \dots, i+1$. La final, mașina trebuie să se întoarcă la depozit, goală sau cu cantitatea rămasă după aprovizionarea cu îngrășăminte a plantației $n$.


# Cerință

Ajutați-l pe Dorel să calculeze distanța parcursă pentru a transporta îngrășăminte la toate cele $n$ plantații, conform cerințelor.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `fermier.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $n$ și $c$, separate printr-un spațiu. A doua linie conține numerele naturale $d_0, d_1, d_2, \dots, d_{n-1}, d_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, unde $d_0$ este distanța dintre prima plantație și depozit, $d_i$ este distanța între plantația $i$ și plantația $i+1$, iar $d_n$ este distanța dintre plantația $n$ și depozit. Pe linia a treia se găsesc numerele naturale $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n-1}, q_n$ separate două câte două prin câte un spațiu, $q_i$ reprezentând cantitatea de îngrășăminte necesară pentru plantația $i$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `fermier.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of plantations `n` and the capacity `c` of the transport vehicle.
   - We then read the distances into a vector `distances` where `distances[0]` is the distance from the depot to plantation 1, `distances[1]` to `distances[n-1]` are the distances between consecutive plantations, and `distances[n]` is the distance from plantation `n` back to the depot.
   - We read the quantities of fertilizer needed for each plantation into a vector `quantities`.

2. **Calculating Total Distance:**
   - We initialize `total_distance` to 0 and `remaining_capacity` to 0.
   - For each plantation, we check if the remaining capacity is enough to cover the required quantity. If not, we calculate the number of trips needed to refill and update the total distance accordingly.
   - We then deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity.
   - For each plantation (except the last one), we add the minimum distance between consecutive plantations or the distance via the depot.
   - After serving the last plantation, we add the distance back to the depot.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, we write the total distance to the output file `fermier.out`.

This solution ensures that we minimize the distance traveled by always choosing the shortest path and efficiently managing the transport vehicle's capacity.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there is a logical error in the original code. Specifically, the error lies in the calculation of the distance when moving between plantations. The code needs to correctly account for the shortest path between consecutive plantations, considering both direct and circular routes.

Let's go through the steps again and identify the necessary corrections:

1. **Reading Input**: This part is correct.
2. **Calculating Total Distance**:
   - We need to ensure that the shortest path between each pair of consecutive plantations is correctly calculated.
   - We should also correctly handle the remaining capacity and refill trips.
3. **Returning to Depot**: This part is correct.

### Corrected Approach:
1. For each plantation, check if the remaining capacity is sufficient to cover the required quantity. If not, calculate the number of trips needed to refill and update the total distance accordingly.
2. Deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity.
3. For each plantation (except the last one), add the minimum distance between consecutive plantations or the distance via the depot.
4. After serving the last plantation, add the distance back to the depot.

### Corrected Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("fermier.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("fermier.out");

    int n, c;
    infile >> n >> c;

    std::vector<int> distances(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        infile >> distances[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> quantities(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> quantities[i];
    }

    int total_distance = 0;
    int remaining_capacity = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (remaining_capacity < quantities[i]) {
            int trips_needed = (quantities[i] - remaining_capacity + c - 1) / c;
            total_distance += trips_needed * distances[0] * 2;
            remaining_capacity += trips_needed * c;
        }

        remaining_capacity -= quantities[i];
        if (i < n - 1) {
            total_distance += std::min(distances[i + 1], distances[0] + distances[n] + distances[i + 1]);
        }
    }

    total_distance += distances[0]; // Return to depot after last plantation

    outfile << total_distance << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}

I apologize for the repeated mistakes. Let's re-evaluate the problem and carefully address the issues.

### Problem Analysis
The main issue lies in correctly calculating the distance traveled, especially when considering the shortest path between consecutive plantations. The algorithm must ensure that it correctly handles:
1. Refilling the transport vehicle when necessary.
2. Calculating the shortest path between plantations.
3. Returning to the depot after the last plantation.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of plantations `n`, the capacity `c`, the distances, and the quantities required.
2. **Calculating Total Distance**:
   - For each plantation, check if the remaining capacity is sufficient to cover the required quantity. If not, calculate the number of trips needed to refill and update the total distance accordingly.
   - Deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity.
   - For each plantation (except the last one), add the minimum distance between consecutive plantations or the distance via the depot.
3. **Returning to Depot**: After serving the last plantation, add the distance back to the depot.

### Corrected Approach:
1. For each plantation, check if the remaining capacity is sufficient to cover the required quantity. If not, calculate the number of trips needed to refill and update the total distance accordingly.
2. Deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity.
3. For each plantation (except the last one), add the minimum distance between consecutive plantations or the distance via the depot.

    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of plantations `n`, the capacity `c`, the distances, and the quantities required.
2. **Calculating Total Distance**:
   - For each plantation, we check if the remaining capacity is sufficient. If not, we calculate the number of trips needed and update the total distance.
   - We then deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity.
   - For each plantation (except the last one), we add the minimum distance between consecutive plantations or the distance via the depot.
3. **Returning to Depot**: After serving the last plantation, we add the distance back to the depot.

This corrected code should now provide the expected output for the given input.

I apologize for the repeated mistakes. Let's carefully analyze the problem and implement a correct solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The main issue lies in correctly calculating the distance traveled, especially when considering the shortest path between consecutive plantations. The algorithm must ensure that it correctly handles:
1. Refilling the transport vehicle when necessary.
2. Calculating the shortest path between plantations.
3. Returning to the depot after the last plantation.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of plantations `n`, the capacity `c`, the distances, and the quantities required.
2. **Calculating Total Distance**:
   - For each plantation, check if the remaining capacity is sufficient to cover the required quantity. If not, calculate the number of trips needed to refill and update the total distance accordingly.
   - Deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity.
   - For each plantation (except the last one), add the minimum distance between consecutive plantations or the distance via the depot.
3. **Returning to Depot**: After serving the last plantation, add the distance back to the depot.

### Corrected Approach:
1. For each plantation, check if the remaining capacity is sufficient to cover the required quantity. If not, calculate the number of trips needed to refill and update the total distance accordingly.
2. Deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity.
3. For each plantation (except the last one), add the minimum distance between consecutive plantations or the distance via the depot.
4. After serving the last plantation, add the distance back to the depot.

### Corrected Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("fermier.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("fermier.out");

    int n, c;
    infile >> n >> c;

    std::vector<int> distances(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        infile >> distances[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> quantities(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> quantities[i];
    }

    int total_distance = 0;
    int remaining_capacity = 0;
    int current_position = 0; // Start at the depot

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Calculate the distance to the next plantation
        int next_position = i + 1;
        int direct_distance = distances[next_position];
        int circular_distance = distances[0] + distances[n] + distances[next_position];

        // Choose the shortest path
        int travel_distance = std::min(direct_distance, circular_distance);

        // If remaining capacity is not enough, refill
        while (remaining_capacity < quantities[i]) {
            total_distance += travel_distance * 2; // Go to depot and come back
            remaining_capacity += c;
        }

        // Deduct the quantity used from the remaining capacity
        remaining_capacity -= quantities[i];

        // Add the distance to the next plantation
        total_distance += travel_distance;
    }

    // Return to depot after the last plantation
    total_distance += distances[0];

    outfile << total_distance << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
