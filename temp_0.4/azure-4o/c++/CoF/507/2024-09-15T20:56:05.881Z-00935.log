~[partitura.png|align=right|width=25%]

Mihai s-a decis în sfârșit să compună o melodie. Fără să știe de unde să înceapă, a scris pe o foaie $n$ note muzicale. Fiecare notă muzicală este definită de două valori reprezentând durata și înălțimea acesteia astfel:
* **durata** este exprimată printr-o fracție de forma $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2^x}$, unde $x$ este un număr natural nenul;
* **înălțimea** este exprimată printr-un număr natural nenul $y$.

Durata unui grup de note este egală cu suma duratelor notelor din grup. Pentru a compune o melodie corect din punct de vedere muzical, el trebuie să distribuie toate notele în grupuri disjuncte, astfel încât durata fiecărui grup să fie $1$. Mihai definește **scorul unui grup** de note ca fiind suma înălțimilor tuturor notelor din grup, ridicată la pătrat. De asemenea, el definește **scorul unei melodii** ca fiind suma scorurilor tuturor grupurilor de note formate
care pot forma un grup.

Mihai vrea să afle care este scorul maxim al unei melodii pe care îl poate obține după gruparea tuturor notelor date.

# Cerință

Dându-se $n$ note sub forma a $n$ perechi de numere, $x$ și $y$, să se afișeze scorul maxim ce poate fi obținut după gruparea tuturor notelor date în grupuri disjuncte.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `partitura.in` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de note, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț, pentru fiecare din cele $n$ note.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `partitura.out` va conține un singur număr natural reprezentând scorul maxim cerut.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 300 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq x \leq 18$;
* $1 \leq y \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că se pot distribui toate notele date în grupuri de durată $1$.
* Pentru $20$ de puncte, $n \leq 4$, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $22$ de puncte, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, pentru toate notele, $x$ are aceeași valoare;
* Pentru $41$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Below is the C++ solution for the given problem. The solution reads from `partitura.in` and writes to `partitura.out` without using `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, or `scanf()`. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to ensure fast execution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

struct Note {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    ifstream infile("partitura.in");
    ofstream outfile("partitura.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    vector<Note> notes(n);
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> duration_map;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> notes[i].x >> notes[i].y;
        duration_map[notes[i].x].push_back(notes[i].y);
    }

    // Sort each duration list in descending order of heights
    for (auto &entry : duration_map) {
        sort(entry.second.rbegin(), entry.second.rend());
    }

    // We need to find groups of notes that sum up to 1
    vector<int> dp(1 << 18, -1);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (const auto &entry : duration_map) {
        int duration = entry.first;
        const vector<int> &heights = entry.second;
        int count = heights.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
            for (int mask = (1 << 18) - 1; mask >= 0; --mask) {
                if (dp[mask] == -1) continue;
                int new_mask = mask + (1 << (duration - 1));
                if (new_mask < (1 << 18)) {
                    dp[new_mask] = max(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + heights[i]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int max_score = 0;
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << 18); mask += (1 << 18) / 2) {
        if (dp[mask] != -1) {
            max_score = max(max_score, dp[mask] * dp[mask]);
        }
    }

    outfile << max_score << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `partitura.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Data Structures**: 
   - `notes` vector stores all the notes.
   - `duration_map` maps each duration to a list of heights.
3. **Sorting**: For each duration, the heights are sorted in descending order.
4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - `dp` array is used to keep track of the maximum sum of heights for each possible duration mask.
   - The mask represents the sum of durations using bits, where each bit represents a power of 2.
5. **Max Score Calculation**: The maximum score is calculated by squaring the sum of heights for valid groups (those that sum up to 1).

This solution ensures efficient handling of the input size constraints and performs the necessary calculations to determine the maximum score.

Thank you for pointing out the issue. Let's re-evaluate the problem and re-implement the solution with the necessary fixes.

### Problem Analysis
We need to group musical notes such that the sum of their durations is exactly 1. Each note has a duration of \( \frac{1}{2^x} \) and a height \( y \). The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the heights of these groups.

### Approach
1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of notes and their respective durations and heights.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum score for each possible group of notes that sum up to a duration of 1.
3. **Bitmasking**: Use bitmasking to represent the sum of durations, as each duration is a power of 2.

### Implementation
Let's implement the solution step-by-step:

1. **Read Input**: Use `ifstream` to read from `partitura.in`.
2. **Sort Notes**: Sort the notes by their durations.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP array to keep track of the maximum score for each possible duration sum.

Here is the corrected and optimized C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

struct Note {
    int duration;
    int height;
};

int main() {
    ifstream infile("partitura.in");
    ofstream outfile("partitura.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    vector<Note> notes(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> notes[i].duration >> notes[i].height;
    }

    // Sort notes by duration
    sort(notes.begin(), notes.end(), [](const Note &a, const Note &b) {
        return a.duration < b.duration;
    });

    // DP array to store the maximum sum of heights for each possible duration sum
    unordered_map<int, int> dp;
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (const auto &note : notes) {
        int duration = note.duration;
        int height = note.height;
        unordered_map<int, int> new_dp = dp;

        for (const auto &entry : dp) {
            int current_duration = entry.first;
            int current_height_sum = entry.second;

            int new_duration = current_duration + (1 << (duration - 1));
            if (new_duration <= (1 << 18)) {
                new_dp[new_duration] = max(new_dp[new_duration], current_height_sum + height);
            }
        }

        dp = new_dp;
    }

    int max_score = 0;
    for (const auto &entry : dp) {
        if (entry.first == (1 << 18) - 1) {
            max_score = max(max_score, entry.second * entry.second);
        }
    }

    outfile << max_score << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `partitura.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Sorting**: The notes are sorted by their duration.
3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - `dp` is an unordered map that stores the maximum sum of heights for each possible duration sum.
   - For each note, we update the `dp` map to include new possible sums of durations.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `partitura.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Sorting**: The notes are sorted by their duration.
3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - `dp` is an unordered map that stores the maximum sum of heights for each possible duration sum.
   - For each note, we update the `dp` map to include new possible sums of durations.
4. **Calculating Maximum Score**: The maximum score is calculated by squaring the sum of heights for valid groups (those that sum up to 1).

This solution ensures efficient handling of the input size constraints and performs the necessary calculations to determine the maximum score.

I apologize for the previous mistakes. Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure we handle it correctly.

### Problem Analysis
We need to group musical notes such that the sum of their durations is exactly 1. Each note has a duration of \( \frac{1}{2^x} \) and a height \( y \). The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the heights of these groups.

### Correct Approach
1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of notes and their respective durations and heights.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum score for each possible group of notes that sum up to a duration of 1.
3. **Bitmasking**: Use bitmasking to represent the sum of durations, as each duration is a power of 2.

### Implementation
Let's implement the solution step-by-step:

1. **Read Input**: Use `ifstream` to read from `partitura.in`.
2. **Sort Notes**: Sort the notes by their durations.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP array to keep track of the maximum score for each possible duration sum.

Here is the corrected and optimized C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

struct Note {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    ifstream infile("partitura.in");
    ofstream outfile("partitura.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    vector<Note> notes(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> notes[i].x >> notes[i].y;
    }

    // Sort notes by duration
    sort(notes.begin(), notes.end(), [](const Note &a, const Note &b) {
        return a.x < b.x;
    });

    // DP array to store the maximum sum of heights for each possible duration sum
    unordered_map<int, int> dp;
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (const auto &note : notes) {
        int duration = 1 << (note.x - 1);
        int height = note.y;
        unordered_map<int, int> new_dp = dp;

        for (const auto &entry : dp) {
            int current_duration = entry.first;
            int current_height_sum = entry.second;

            int new_duration = current_duration + duration;
            if (new_duration <= (1 << 18)) {
                new_dp[new_duration] = max(new_dp[new_duration], current_height_sum + height);
            }
        }

        dp = new_dp;
    }

    int max_score = 0;
    for (const auto &entry : dp) {
        if (entry.first == (1 << 18) - 1) {
            max_score = max(max_score, entry.second * entry.second);
        }
    }

    outfile << max_score << endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
