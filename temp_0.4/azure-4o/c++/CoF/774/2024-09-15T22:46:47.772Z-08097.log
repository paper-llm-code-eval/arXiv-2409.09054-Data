Într-un tablou bidimensional de dimensiuni date $m$ (numărul de linii) şi $n$ (numărul de coloane) există în fiecare celulă o valoare $0$ sau $1$. Un turn este format numai din valori $1$ vecine, de pe aceeaşi coloană, numărul acestor valori egale cu $1$ reprezentând înălţimea turnului. Se consideră că pe o coloană nu există alte valori egale cu 1 în afara celor care intră în componenţa unui turn.

Fiecare coloană poate conţine câte un singur turn. Dacă o coloană are numai valori $0$, se consideră totuşi că acea coloană conţine un turn de înălţime $0$. Dacă o coloană are una sau mai multe valori $1$, atunci una dintre ele este obligatoriu plasată pe ultima linie.

Luând pe rând toate perechile formate din câte $2$ turnuri aflate pe coloane vecine, este posibilă următoarea operaţie de reconfigurare: din $2$ turnuri de înălţime nenulă, de pe $2$ coloane vecine se poate forma un nou turn cu înălţimea egală cu suma celor două. Dorim astfel să obţinem în final numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă. Există însă două condiţii care trebuie respectate:
- înălţimea noului turn format nu poate depăşi valoarea $m$ (numărul de linii ale tabloului);
- orice turn care a contribuit la formarea unui turn de înălţime maximă nu mai poate contribui şi la formarea unui alt turn de înălţime maximă.

Operaţia de reconfigurare se efectuează o singură dată.

# Cerință

Dându-se tabloul bidimensional cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane cu valori $0$ şi $1$, se cere:

1. Să se afişeze înălţimile turnurilor din configuraţia iniţială, precizându-se şi turnurile cu înălţime $0$, începând cu cel mai din stânga turn
2. Să se afişeze înălţimea maximă a turnurilor rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare
3. Să se afişeze numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă, rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `turnuri.in` va conţine:

- pe prima linie din fişier se află numărul natural $m$ care reprezintă numărul de linii şi numărul natural $n$ care reprezintă numărul de coloane, valori separate între ele printr-un spaţiu
- pe următoarele $m$ linii câte n valori $0$ sau $1$, separate două câte două printr-un spaţiu

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `turnuri.out` va conţine trei linii:

- pe prima linie se află înălţimile iniţiale ale turnurilor, valori separate două câte două printr-un spaţiu
- pe a doua linie se află înălţimea maximă a turnurilor rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare
- pe a treia linie se află numărul maxim de turnuri de înălţime maximă, rezultate după operaţia de reconfigurare


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m, n \leq 1 \ 000$; 
* Testele si restricțiile au fost refăcute pentru standardele anului $2023$
* Se acordă punctaje parţiale: cerinţa a) $40$% din punctaj, cerinţa b) $40$% din punctaj, cerinţa c) $20$%.
* Toate turnurile incep de pe ultima linie a matricii.

}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the dimensions `m` and `n` from the input file.
   - We then read the matrix values and simultaneously calculate the heights of the towers in each column.

2. **Initial Heights:**
   - We store the heights of the towers in a vector `heights` and output them.

3. **Reconfiguration:**
   - We iterate through the columns and check if neighboring columns can be combined to form a taller tower.
   - We ensure that the combined height does not exceed `m`.
   - We keep track of the maximum possible height and the number of such maximum towers.

4. **Output Results:**
   - If no valid combination is found, we fall back to the highest single tower.
   - We output the maximum height and the number of such towers.

This solution ensures efficient reading, processing, and writing, adhering to the constraints and requirements.

The discrepancy in the output occurs because the algorithm incorrectly counts the number of maximum height towers after reconfiguration. Specifically, it counts all possible combinations that yield the maximum height, rather than ensuring that each tower is only counted once.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we only count each pair of towers once and correctly handle non-overlapping pairs to avoid double-counting.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("turnuri.in");
    ofstream outFile("turnuri.out");

    int m, n;
    inFile >> m >> n;

    vector<vector<int>> matrix(m, vector<int>(n));
    vector<int> heights(n, 0);

    // Read the matrix and calculate initial tower heights
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            inFile >> matrix[i][j];
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                heights[j]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output initial heights
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        outFile << heights[i];
        if (i < n - 1) {
            outFile << " ";
        }
    }
    outFile << "\n";

    // Calculate maximum height after reconfiguration
    int max_height = 0;
    int max_towers = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (heights[i] > 0 && heights[i + 1] > 0) {
            int combined_height = heights[i] + heights[i + 1];
            if (combined_height <= m) {
                if (combined_height > max_height) {
                    max_height = combined_height;
                    max_towers = 1;
                } else if (combined_height == max_height) {
                    max_towers++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // If no combination was found, max height remains the highest single tower
    if (max_height == 0) {
        max_height = *max_element(heights.begin(), heights.end());
        max_towers = count(heights.begin(), heights.end(), max_height);
    } else {
        // Count the number of max_height towers
        int temp_towers = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (heights[i] > 0 && heights[i + 1] > 0) {
                int combined_height = heights[i] + heights[i + 1];
                if (combined_height == max_height) {
                    temp_towers++;
                    i++; // Skip the next column as it's already combined
                }
            }
        }
        max_towers = temp_towers;
    }

    outFile << max_height << "\n";
    outFile << max_towers << "\n";

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Initial Heights Calculation:**
   - This part remains unchanged as it correctly calculates the initial heights of the towers.

2. **Reconfiguration Calculation:**
   - The main change is in how we count the maximum height towers. We ensure that we only count each pair once and skip to the next pair after a valid combination is found.

3. **Fallback for Single Towers:**
   - If no valid combination is found, we correctly fall back to the highest single tower and count its occurrences.

4. **Output:**
   - We output the results as required.

This corrected solution ensures that we correctly handle the reconfiguration and counting of towers to match the expected output.

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Initial Heights Calculation:**
   - This part remains unchanged as it correctly calculates the initial heights of the towers.

2. **Reconfiguration Calculation:**
   - We store all possible combined heights in a vector `combined_heights`.
   - We determine the maximum height from these combined heights.
   - We count the number of times the maximum height appears in the `combined_heights` vector.

3. **Adjust for Non-Overlapping Pairs:**
   - We adjust the count of maximum towers by ensuring that we only count non-overlapping pairs.

4. **Fallback for Single Towers:**
   - If no valid combination is found, we correctly fall back to the highest single tower and count its occurrences.

5. **Output:**
   - We output the results as required.

This corrected solution ensures that we correctly handle the reconfiguration and counting of towers to match the expected output.

The discrepancy in the output arises because the algorithm incorrectly counts the number of maximum height towers after reconfiguration. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle non-overlapping pairs of towers, leading to an undercount of the maximum towers.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we correctly count all possible pairs of towers that can form the maximum height, while ensuring that we do not double-count any towers. We can achieve this by iterating over the columns and checking for valid pairs, then skipping the next column if a valid pair is found.

Here is the corrected solution:

    vector<int> heights(n, 0);

    // Read the matrix and calculate initial tower heights
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            inFile >> matrix[i][j];
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                heights[j]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Output initial heights
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        outFile << heights[i];
        if (i < n - 1) {

                }
            }
        }
    }

    // If no combination was found, max height remains the highest single tower
