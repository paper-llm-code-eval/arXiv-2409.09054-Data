Campania electorală s-a terminat de mult, dar zidul din parcul central al orașului în care au fost puse afișele este încă într-o formă dezolantă. Ploile și vântul au acționat și au urâțit și mai mult această zonă pe care altă dată erau afișe frumos colorate. Primăria a decis să se ocupe de această problemă. A format o comisie și a decis realizarea unor panouri reclamă care să ascundă porțiunile deteriorate.

Deoarece fondurile sunt mici s-a decis să fie alocate doar un anumit număr de panouri publicitare care trebuie să ocupe o suprafață cât mai mică posibil. Comisia a primit datele din teren sub forma: lungime zid, câte unități sunt ocupate cu afișe ce trebuie acoperite și care este numărul de panouri pe care le poate folosi. De asemenea se primesc ca date și care sunt unitățile de zid ocupate cu afișe deja deteriorate.

# Cerință

Fiind date lungimea zidului, câte unități sunt deteriorate, care este numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite și care sunt unitățile de zid deteriorate, se cere să se determine lungimea minimă totală a panourilor care sunt folosite pentru a acoperi zona și câte panouri se folosesc. Lungimea minimă o definim ca numărul total de unități de zid acoperite astfel încât să fie mascate zonele problemă. Pentru acoperirea unităților de zid deteriorate, nu este neapărat necesar să se folosească toate panourile. Numărul de panouri folosite fiind limitat există posibilitatea să fie acoperite și zone din zid care sunt curate.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `afise.in` conține pe prima linie $3$ valori separate prin câte un spațiu $L \ n \ k$, cu semnificația: $L$ lungimea totală a zidului, $n$ numărul de unități ce urmează a fi acoperite și $k$ numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite. Pe a doua linie separate prin câte un spațiu sunt $n$ valori $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, unde xi reprezintă unitatea din zid care este acoperită de un afiș vechi. Valorile $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, apar într-o ordine aleatoare.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `afise.out` conține o singură linie cu două valoari ce reprezintă lungimea minimă totală folosită și numărul de panouri folosite astfel încât toate zonele deteriorate să fie acoperite.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < L \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 < n \leq L$;
* $0 < k \leq L / 2$;

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to cover the deteriorated units on a wall with a minimal total length of panels, while using no more than a given number of panels. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Read Input Data**: Read the length of the wall, the number of deteriorated units, the maximum number of panels, and the positions of the deteriorated units.
2. **Sort the Positions**: To simplify the problem, sort the positions of the deteriorated units.
3. **Calculate Gaps**: Calculate the gaps between consecutive deteriorated units.
4. **Select Panels**: To minimize the total length of the panels, we should cover the largest gaps with fewer panels. This can be achieved by sorting the gaps and choosing the largest ones to be covered by the panels.
5. **Compute Results**: Sum the lengths of the panels and determine the number of panels used.

Here's the C++ code implementing the above approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("afise.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("afise.out");

    int L, n, k;
    infile >> L >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> positions(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> positions[i];
    }

    // Sort the positions of the deteriorated units
    std::sort(positions.begin(), positions.end());

    // Calculate the gaps between consecutive deteriorated units
    std::vector<int> gaps;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        gaps.push_back(positions[i] - positions[i - 1]);
    }

    // Sort the gaps in descending order
    std::sort(gaps.rbegin(), gaps.rend());

    // We need to cover the largest gaps with panels
    int total_length = positions.back() - positions.front() + 1;
    int panels_used = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < k - 1 && i < gaps.size(); ++i) {
        total_length -= gaps[i] - 1;
        panels_used++;
    }

    outfile << total_length << " " << panels_used << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values from `afise.in`.
2. **Sorting Positions**: The positions of the deteriorated units are sorted.
3. **Calculating Gaps**: The gaps between consecutive deteriorated units are calculated.
4. **Sorting Gaps**: The gaps are sorted in descending order to prioritize covering the largest gaps first.
5. **Covering Gaps**: The largest gaps are covered with panels, reducing the total length of the panels needed.
6. **Output Results**: The total length of the panels and the number of panels used are written to `afise.out`.

This approach ensures that we use the minimum total length of panels while covering all the deteriorated units with the given constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output stems from the way we handle the number of panels used. In the initial solution, we didn't account for the possibility of using fewer panels than the maximum allowed when it was more optimal.

Let's re-evaluate the approach and correct the implementation:

1. **Read Input Data**: Read the length of the wall, the number of deteriorated units, the maximum number of panels, and the positions of the deteriorated units.
2. **Sort the Positions**: To simplify the problem, sort the positions of the deteriorated units.
3. **Calculate Gaps**: Calculate the gaps between consecutive deteriorated units.
4. **Select Panels**: To minimize the total length of the panels, we should cover the largest gaps with fewer panels. This can be achieved by sorting the gaps and choosing the largest ones to be covered by the panels.

    }

    // Sort the positions of the deteriorated units
    std::sort(positions.begin(), positions.end());

    // Calculate the gaps between consecutive deteriorated units
    std::vector<int> gaps;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        gaps.push_back(positions[i] - positions[i - 1]);
    }

    // Sort the gaps in descending order
    std::sort(gaps.rbegin(), gaps.rend());

    // We need to cover the largest gaps with panels

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to the incorrect handling of the number of panels used. The previous implementation always increments the panel count, even when fewer panels are sufficient. Let's correct this by ensuring we only use the necessary number of panels.

### Comprehensive Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Panel Usage**: The previous implementation increments the panel count in each iteration of the loop, which is incorrect. It should only increment when a gap is actually covered by a new panel.
2. **Edge Cases**: The previous implementation doesn't handle cases where fewer panels than the maximum allowed are sufficient.

2. **Sorting Positions**: The positions of the deteriorated units are sorted.
3. **Calculating Gaps**: The gaps between consecutive deteriorated units are calculated.
4. **Sorting Gaps**: The gaps are sorted in descending order to prioritize covering the largest gaps first.
5. **Covering Gaps**: The largest gaps are covered with panels, reducing the total length of the panels needed.
6. **Output Results**: The total length of the panels and the number of panels used are written to `afise.out`.

This approach ensures that we use the minimum total length of panels while covering all the deteriorated units with the given constraints. The corrected implementation should now produce the expected results.
