Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.
* Pentru teste in valoare de `18` puncte datele de intrare sunt cunoscute. Mai precis:
Testul 0 : `n = 91, e = 90`
Testul 1 : `n = 30, e = 435`
Testul 2 : `n = 7, e = 16`
* Pentru alte teste in valoare de `15` puncte `n≤9`.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("galeti.in");
    ofstream outfile("galeti.out");

    long long n, e;
    infile >> n >> e;

    vector<pair<int, int>> pours;
    long long current_effort = 0;

    for (int i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        pours.push_back({i, 1});
        current_effort += 1;
    }

    if (current_effort == e) {
        for (const auto& pour : pours) {
            outfile << pour.first << " " << pour.second << endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    long long additional_effort = e - current_effort;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (additional_effort == 0) break;
        long long pour_amount = min(additional_effort, (long long)i-1);
        pours.push_back({i, 1});
        additional_effort -= pour_amount;
    }

    for (const auto& pour : pours) {
        outfile << pour.first << " " << pour.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:** We read the number of buckets `n` and the required effort `e` from the file `galeti.in`.
2. **Initial Pouring Sequence:** We start by pouring all buckets into the first bucket (from right to left) which guarantees that all water ends up in the first bucket with minimal effort.
3. **Adjusting Effort:** If the initial effort is less than `e`, we adjust by pouring additional amounts from each bucket to the first bucket until the total effort matches `e`.
4. **Output:** We write the sequence of pourings to the file `galeti.out`.

This approach ensures that we achieve the exact required effort efficiently.

The initial solution did not produce the expected result because it did not correctly account for the specific sequence of pouring required to achieve the exact effort `e`. The approach was too simplistic and did not consider the intermediate states of the buckets properly.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and come up with a more accurate solution. The key is to ensure that we pour water in such a way that we can control the exact effort required.

Here is a revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream infile("galeti.in");
    ofstream outfile("galeti.out");

    long long n, e;
    infile >> n >> e;

    vector<pair<int, int>> pours;
    long long current_effort = 0;

    // Start by pouring from the last bucket to the first bucket
    for (int i = n; i > 1; --i) {
        pours.push_back({i, i-1});
        current_effort += 1;
    }

    // Adjusting the effort to match exactly e
    int i = 2;
    while (current_effort < e && i <= n) {
        long long additional_effort = min(e - current_effort, (long long)i-1);
        pours.push_back({i, 1});
        current_effort += additional_effort;
        i++;
    }

    // Output the sequence of pours
    for (const auto& pour : pours) {
        outfile << pour.first << " " << pour.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
