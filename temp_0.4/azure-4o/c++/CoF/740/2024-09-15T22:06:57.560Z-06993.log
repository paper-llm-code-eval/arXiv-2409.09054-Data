Se dă numărul natural $k$. Dorim să obţinem un tablou unidimensional $a$, cu elemente naturale constituite astfel: $a_1 =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_1$ este cifra sutelor produsului $k \cdot k$, iar cifra unităţilor lui $a_1$ este cifra zecilor produsului $k \cdot k$).

Pentru $i > 1$, $a_i$ se obţine astfel: $a_i =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra sutelor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$, iar cifra unităţilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra zecilor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$).

Procesul de generare a termenilor tabloului se încheie în momentul când este generat un număr ce a mai fost generat înainte. Ultimul număr (cel ce se repetă) nu face parte din tablou.

Este posibil ca numerele numite în text ca fiind de “două cifre” să aibă de fapt doar o cifră, în cazul în care cifra zecilor lor este $0$; ele pot fi chiar şi $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care:

1. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut;
2. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut, dar sortate crescător după prima lor cifră (cea mai din stânga).

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găsește $k$.

# Date de ieșire

* Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea generării lor, separate de un spaţiu.
* Pe a doua linie se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea cerută la cerinţa a doua; elementele vor fi separate de câte un spaţiu

# Restricții și precizări

* $11 \leq k \leq 999$;
* La cerinţa a doua: dacă două sau mai multe elemente din tabloul $a$ au aceeaşi primă cifră, atunci aceste elemente se pot afişa în orice ordine ce respectă cerinţa. În exemplul de mai jos, afişarea pentru cerinţa a doua putea fi şi sub forma: $0 \ 2 \ 25 \ 5 \ 62 \ 84$, adică am interschimbat $2$ cu $25$, pentru că ambele au prima cifră $2$ în acest caz, alte posibilităţi de afişare nu mai sunt.
* Pentru prima cerinţă rezolvată corect se atribuie $60\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru a doua, încă $40\%$ din punctaj.

Example:
`sir.in`
```
16
```

`sir.out`
```
25 62 84 5 2 0
0 25 2 5 62 84

}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read from `sir.in` file.
   - The input integer `k` is read from the file.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - A helper function `getTwoDigitNumber` is defined to compute the two-digit number based on the rules specified.
   - The sequence generation starts with the initial value derived from `k`.
   - The sequence is generated until a repeating number is encountered. The last repeating number is not included in the sequence.

3. **Output the Sequence:**
   - The sequence is output in the order of generation.
   - The sequence is then sorted based on the first digit of each number.
   - The sorted sequence is output.

### Efficiency:
- The use of `unordered_set` ensures that checking for duplicates is efficient.
- The sorting step uses the standard library sort which is efficient for the given constraints.

This solution should be efficient and correct for the given problem constraints.

The issue with the previous solution lies in the sorting criteria for the second line of output. The requirement is to sort the numbers based on the first digit, but if two numbers have the same first digit, they should retain their relative order from the original sequence. This is known as a "stable sort."

Here is the revised solution that addresses this issue:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to extract the two-digit number as per the problem statement
int getTwoDigitNumber(int n) {
    int product = n * n;
    int tens = (product / 10) % 10;
    int hundreds = (product / 100) % 10;
    return hundreds * 10 + tens;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("sir.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("sir.out");

    int k;
    infile >> k;

    std::vector<int> sequence;
    std::unordered_set<int> seen;
    
    int current = getTwoDigitNumber(k);
    while (seen.find(current) == seen.end()) {
        sequence.push_back(current);
        seen.insert(current);
        current = getTwoDigitNumber(current);
    }

    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
        outfile << sequence[i];
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    // Create a vector of pairs to maintain the original index
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> indexed_sequence;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        indexed_sequence.push_back({sequence[i], i});
    }

    // Sort the sequence based on the first digit, preserving the relative order
    std::stable_sort(indexed_sequence.begin(), indexed_sequence.end(), [](const std::pair<int, int>& a, const std::pair<int, int>& b) {
        return (a.first / 10) < (b.first / 10);
    });

    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (size_t i = 0; i < indexed_sequence.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
        outfile << indexed_sequence[i].first;
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly handle the sorting criteria for the second line of output. Specifically, the sorting needs to be done based on the first digit of each number, but the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the sorting is based on the first digit of each number, and if two numbers have the same first digit, they should retain their relative order from the original sequence. This can be done using a stable sort with a custom comparator.

Here's the corrected solution:

    int tens = (product / 10) % 10;
    int hundreds = (product / 100) % 10;
    return hundreds * 10 + tens;

        sequence.push_back(current);
        seen.insert(current);
        current = getTwoDigitNumber(current);
    }

    // Output the sequence in the order of generation
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
        outfile << sequence[i];
    }
    outfile << "\n";

    // Create a vector of pairs to maintain the original index
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> indexed_sequence;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
        indexed_sequence.push_back({sequence[i], i});
    }

    // Sort the sequence based on the first digit, preserving the relative order
    std::stable_sort(indexed_sequence.begin(), indexed_sequence.end(), [](const std::pair<int, int>& a, const std::pair<int, int>& b) {
        return (a.first / 10) < (b.first / 10);
    });

    // Output the sorted sequence
    for (size_t i = 0; i < indexed_sequence.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
        outfile << indexed_sequence[i].first;
