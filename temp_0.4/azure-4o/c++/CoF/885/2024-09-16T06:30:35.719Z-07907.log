Se consideră un tablou cu N linii și N coloane (numerotate de la $1$ la $N$) care conține valoarea $1$ în fiecare dintre cele $N \ cdot N$ celule. Valorile din tablou pot fi modificate prin aplicarea a două operații codificate astfel:

* $L \ nr$, prin care se schimbă simultan toate semnele numerelor din linia cu numărul $nr$.
* $C \ nr$, prin care se schimbă simultan toate semnele numerelor din coloana cu numărul $nr$.

# Cerință
1. Dându-se o succesiune de $K$ operații ($L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$) asupra liniilor/coloanelor tabloului inițial (în care toate celulele conțin valoarea $1$) să se determine numărul valorilor pozitive din tablou la finalul executării celor $K$ operații.
2. Să se determine numărul minim de operații $L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$, care, aplicate tabloului inițial, îl modifică astfel încât tabloul obținut să conțină exact $Z$ valori negative.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `tablou.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $p = 1$ sau $p = 2$, reprezentând numărul cerinței ce trebuie rezolvată.

* Dacă $p = 1$ atunci linia a doua a fișierului de intrare conține numerele $N$ și $K$, separate printr-un spațiu, iar următoarele $K$ linii conțin fiecare câte o literă mare ($L$ sau $C$) și un număr $nr$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând codificarea uneia dintre cele două operații ($L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$).
* Dacă $p = 2$ atunci linia a doua a fișierului de intrare conține numerele $N$ și $Z$, separate printr-un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

* Dacă $p = 1$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `tablou.out` conține pe prima linie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul valorilor pozitive din tabloul obținut la finalul executării celor $K$ operații asupra tabloului inițial (răspunsul la cerința $1$).
* Dacă $p = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `tablou.out` conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul minim de operații $L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$, care, aplicate tabloului inițial, îl modifică astfel încât tabloul obținut să conțină exact $Z$ valori negative (răspunsul la cerința $2$). Dacă prin aplicarea de operații $L \ nr$ sau $C \ nr$ tabloului inițial nu se poate obține un tablou cu $Z$ valori negative, atunci, fișierul va conține pe prima linie valoarea $0$ (zero).

# Restricții și precizări

* $N, K, Z$ și $nr$ sunt numere naturale
* $3 \leq N \leq 20 \ 000$; $1 \leq K \leq 43 \ 000$; $1 \leq Z \leq N \cdot N$; $1 \leq nr \leq N$;
* Prin schimbare de semn, valoarea $-1$ se transformă în $1$ și valoarea $1$ se transformă în $-1$
* Se acordă $10$ puncte din oficiu și câte $45$ de puncte pentru rezolvarea corectă a fiecărei cerințe.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the operations and their effects on the matrix. Given the constraints, direct simulation of the matrix operations would be too slow, so we need to use a more optimal approach.

### Approach:

1. **For Requirement 1 (p=1)**:
   - We need to count the number of positive values in the matrix after performing a series of operations.
   - Instead of flipping the signs directly in the matrix, we can maintain two arrays (`rowFlips` and `colFlips`) to keep track of the number of flips for each row and column.
   - After processing all operations, we can determine the final state of each cell by checking the parity (even or odd) of the flips for its row and column.

2. **For Requirement 2 (p=2)**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `Z` negative values in the matrix.
   - This problem can be approached by considering the parity of the number of flips needed to achieve the desired number of negative values.

### Detailed Implementation:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("tablou.in");
    ofstream fout("tablou.out");

    int p;
    fin >> p;

    if (p == 1) {
        int N, K;
        fin >> N >> K;

        vector<int> rowFlips(N + 1, 0);
        vector<int> colFlips(N + 1, 0);

        char op;
        int nr;
        for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
            fin >> op >> nr;
            if (op == 'L') {
                rowFlips[nr]++;
            } else if (op == 'C') {
                colFlips[nr]++;
            }
        }

        int positiveCount = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
                int flips = rowFlips[i] + colFlips[j];
                if (flips % 2 == 0) {
                    positiveCount++;
                }
            }
        }

        fout << positiveCount << endl;

    } else if (p == 2) {
        int N, Z;
        fin >> N >> Z;

        int totalCells = N * N;
        int minOperations = 0;

        if (Z > totalCells) {
            fout << 0 << endl;
        } else {
            int halfCells = totalCells / 2;
            if (Z <= halfCells) {
                minOperations = Z;
            } else {
                minOperations = totalCells - Z;
            }
            fout << minOperations << endl;
        }
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Reading Input**: The input is read from `tablou.in` using `ifstream`.
- **Requirement 1**:
  - We maintain two arrays `rowFlips` and `colFlips` to keep track of the number of flips for each row and column.
  - For each operation, we increment the respective row or column flip count.
  - After processing all operations, we count the number of positive values by checking the parity of the flips for each cell.
- **Requirement 2**:
  - We calculate the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `Z` negative values.
  - If `Z` is less than or equal to half of the total cells, the minimum operations are `Z`.
  - If `Z` is more than half of the total cells, the minimum operations are the complement of `Z` to the total cells (i.e., `totalCells - Z`).

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the operations and determine the final state of the matrix without directly manipulating it, which is crucial given the problem constraints.

### Explanation:
- **Reading Input**: The input is read from `tablou.in` using `ifstream`.
- **Requirement 1**:
  - We maintain two arrays `rowFlips` and `colFlips` to keep track of the number of flips for each row and column.
  - For each operation, we increment the respective row or column flip count.
  - After processing all operations, we count the number of positive values by checking the parity of the flips for each cell.
- **Requirement 2**:
  - We calculate the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `Z` negative values.
  - If `Z` is less than or equal to half of the total cells, the minimum operations are `Z`.
  - If `Z` is more than half of the total cells, the minimum operations are the complement of `Z` to the total cells (i.e., `totalCells - Z`).

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the operations and determine the final state of the matrix without directly manipulating it, which is crucial given the problem constraints.

Thank you for your patience. I understand the issue now. The problem lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of operations to achieve exactly `Z` negative values. Let's re-evaluate and correct the approach.

### Problem Analysis
For requirement 2 (p=2), we need to determine the minimum number of operations to achieve exactly `Z` negative values in the matrix. The matrix starts with all values as `1`.

### Key Observations:
1. Each operation flips the signs of an entire row or column.
2. To achieve `Z` negative values, we need to consider the parity of the number of operations.
3. The total number of cells in the matrix is `N * N`.

### Detailed Plan:
1. **For Requirement 1 (p=1)**:
   - Use two arrays to track the number of flips for each row and column.
   - Calculate the number of positive values based on the parity of flips.

2. **For Requirement 2 (p=2)**:
   - Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `Z` negative values.
   - If `Z` is less than or equal to half of the total cells, the minimum operations are `Z`.
   - If `Z` is more than half of the total cells, the minimum operations are the complement of `Z` to the total cells (i.e., `totalCells - Z`).
