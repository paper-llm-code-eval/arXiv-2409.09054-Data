Discul dur (hard disk) este un dispozitiv utilizat pentru stocarea datelor. Stocarea se face pe o suprafață magnetică dispusă pe platane rotunde metalice. Pe un platan, datele sunt organizate în **piste** și **sectoare**, iar zona aflată la intersecția dintre o pistă și un sector poartă denumirea de **cluster**.

Un cluster poate avea două stări: **liber**, dacă nu conține date, sau **ocupat**, atunci când conține date.

Un platan se numește **defragmentat** dacă toți clusterii ocupați de pe fiecare pistă sunt așezați în ordine consecutivă. Defragmentarea se realizează prin mutarea unor clusteri ocupați și are rolul de a micșora timpul de acces la date. Mutarea unui cluster reprezintă transferul datelor de la un cluster ocupat către un cluster liber de pe aceeași pistă.

~[defrag.png|width=90em|align=center]

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de piste $P$ și de sectoare $S$ al unui platan, numărul și poziția clusterilor ocupați, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. numărul de piste care au toți clusterii liberi;
2. numărul **minim** de mutări de clusteri, pentru fiecare pistă în parte, astfel încât platanul să devină defragmentat.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare `defrag.in` se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.
Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsesc două numere naturale $P$ și $S$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ.
A treia linie conţine un număr natural $C$ reprezentând numărul total de clusteri ocupați de pe platan, iar pe fiecare din următoarele $C$ linii se găsește câte o pereche de valori $p_i$ şi $s_i$, $1 \leq i \leq C$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând pista, respectiv sectorul unde se află fiecare cluster ocupat.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire este `defrag.out`.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de piste care au toți clusterii liberi.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conține pe prima linie $P$ numere naturale notate $M_i$, $1 \leq i \leq P$, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, unde $M_i$ reprezintă numărul minim de mutări de clusteri, dintre cei aflați pe pista $i$, astfel încât pe pista $i$ clusterii ocupați să se găsească într-o ordine consecutivă.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $1 \leq P \leq 100$
- $1 \leq S \leq 360$
- $1 \leq C \leq P \cdot S$
- Pistele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $P$ începând cu pista exterioară.
- Sectoarele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $S$ în sensul acelor de ceasornic începând cu sectorul $1$.
- Dacă o pistă are toți clusterii liberi, atunci valoarea cerută la a doua cerință este $0$.
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 2$.

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the input values from `defrag.in` using `ifstream`.
   - It reads the values of `V`, `P`, `S`, and `C`.
   - It then reads the positions of the occupied clusters and stores them in a vector of vectors called `clusters`.

2. **Processing for V = 1:**
   - If `V` is 1, the code counts the number of tracks that have all clusters free.
   - It iterates through each track and checks if the `clusters` vector for that track is empty.
   - The result is written to `defrag.out`.

3. **Processing for V = 2:**
   - If `V` is 2, the code calculates the minimum number of moves required to defragment each track.
   - For each track, it sorts the occupied clusters.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of moves needed to make the clusters consecutive.
   - The result is written to `defrag.out`.

### Efficiency:
- The solution is efficient given the constraints. Sorting the clusters for each track is `O(C log C)`, and the subsequent calculations are linear in terms of the number of clusters.
- The overall complexity should be manageable within the given constraints of the problem.

The discrepancy in the output indicates that the current approach to calculating the minimum number of moves for defragmentation is flawed. Specifically, it seems that the logic for counting the minimum moves is not correctly implemented.

Let's break down the problem again and identify the correct approach:

1. **Count Free Tracks:**
   - This part is straightforward. We need to count the number of tracks that have no occupied clusters.

2. **Calculate Minimum Moves for Defragmentation:**
   - For each track, we need to sort the occupied clusters.
   - We need to find the minimum number of moves required to make the clusters consecutive. This can be done by considering the cost of moving clusters to start from each possible position within the track.

Given the constraints, the solution should be efficient and correct. Let's reimplement the solution with a corrected approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("defrag.in");
    ofstream fout("defrag.out");

    int V, P, S, C;
    fin >> V >> P >> S >> C;

    vector<vector<int>> clusters(P + 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < C; ++i) {
        int p, s;
        fin >> p >> s;
        clusters[p].push_back(s);
    }

    if (V == 1) {
        int free_tracks = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= P; ++i) {
            if (clusters[i].empty()) {
                ++free_tracks;
            }
        }
        fout << free_tracks << endl;
    } else if (V == 2) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= P; ++i) {
            if (clusters[i].empty()) {
                fout << 0 << " ";
                continue;
            }
            sort(clusters[i].begin(), clusters[i].end());

            int min_moves = INT_MAX;
            int occupied_size = clusters[i].size();

            // Try to align the clusters starting from each possible position
            for (int start = 0; start <= S - occupied_size; ++start) {
                int moves = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < occupied_size; ++j) {
                    if (clusters[i][j] != start + j + 1) {
                        ++moves;
                    }
                }
                min_moves = min(min_moves, moves);
            }

            fout << min_moves << " ";
        }
        fout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

The issue with the previous solution lies in the logic for calculating the minimum number of moves required to defragment each track. Specifically, the approach of aligning clusters starting from each possible position within the track is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required to make the clusters consecutive. We will use a sliding window approach to find the minimum number of moves required to make the clusters consecutive.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Count Free Tracks:**
   - This part is straightforward. We need to count the number of tracks that have no occupied clusters.

2. **Calculate Minimum Moves for Defragmentation:**

1. **Sort the clusters on each track.**
2. **Calculate the minimum number of moves required to make clusters consecutive.**
3. **Consider both linear and wrap-around possibilities.**

Let's reimplement the solution with the corrected approach:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("defrag.in");
    ofstream fout("defrag.out");

    int V, P, S, C;
    fin >> V >> P >> S >> C;

    vector<vector<int>> clusters(P + 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < C; ++i) {
        int p, s;
        fin >> p >> s;
        clusters[p].push_back(s);
    }

    if (V == 1) {
        int free_tracks = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= P; ++i) {
            if (clusters[i].empty()) {
                ++free_tracks;
            }
        }
        fout << free_tracks << endl;
    } else if (V == 2) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= P; ++i) {
            if (clusters[i].empty()) {
                fout << 0 << " ";
                continue;
            }
            sort(clusters[i].begin(), clusters[i].end());

            int min_moves = INT_MAX;
            int occupied_size = clusters[i].size();

            // Linear case
            for (int start = 0; start <= S - occupied_size; ++start) {
                int moves = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < occupied_size; ++j) {
                    if (clusters[i][j] != start + j + 1) {
                        ++moves;
                    }
                }
                min_moves = min(min_moves, moves);
            }

            // Wrap-around case
            for (int start = 1; start <= occupied_size; ++start) {
                int moves = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < occupied_size; ++j) {
                    int target_pos = (start + j - 1) % S + 1;
                    if (clusters[i][j] != target_pos) {
                        ++moves;
                    }
                }
                min_moves = min(min_moves, moves);
            }

            fout << min_moves << " ";
        }
        fout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the input values from `defrag.in` using `ifstream`.
   - It reads the values of `V`, `P`, `S`, and `C`.
   - It then reads the positions of the occupied clusters and stores them in a vector of vectors called `clusters`.

2. **Processing for V = 1:**
   - If `V` is 1, the code counts the number of tracks that have all clusters free.
   - It iterates through each track and checks if the `clusters` vector for that track is empty.
   - The result is written to `defrag.out`.

3. **Processing for V = 2:**
   - If `V` is 2, the code calculates the minimum number of moves required to defragment each track.
   - For each track, it sorts the occupied clusters.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of moves needed to make the clusters consecutive by trying to align them starting from each possible position within the track.
   - Additionally, it handles the wrap-around case to ensure clusters can be made consecutive even if they span the end and start of the track.
   - The result is written to `defrag.out`.

### Efficiency:
- The solution is efficient given the constraints. Sorting the clusters for each track is `O(C log C)`, and the subsequent calculations are linear in terms of the number of clusters.
- The overall complexity should be manageable within the given constraints of the problem.

### Correction:
The previous implementation did not correctly handle the wrap-around case. The new implementation considers both linear and wrap-around cases, ensuring the correct minimum number of moves is calculated.

### Problem Analysis

3. **Consider both linear and wrap-around possibilities.**

### Detailed Steps

1. **Linear Case:**
   - Sort the clusters.
   - Calculate the minimum number of moves required to make the clusters consecutive starting from each possible position.
