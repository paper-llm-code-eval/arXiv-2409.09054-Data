Se consideră următorul şir, construit astfel încât fiecare element al lui, cu excepţia primului, se obţine din cel precedent: $1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, \dots$
Termenii din şir sunt numerotaţi începând cu $1$.

# Cerință

Dat $n$, un număr natural, să se determine cel de-al $n$-lea termen din şirul dat.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găseste numarul $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se va găsi un singur număr întreg, al $n$-lea termen al sirului.

# Restricții și precizări

* $4 \leq n \leq 35$;
* numărul de cifre ale unui termen nu depăşeşte $17 \ 000$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently in C++, we need to generate the sequence iteratively up to the nth term. The sequence is known as the "look-and-say" sequence, where each term is generated by describing the previous term. 

Here's the plan:
1. Read the input value `n` from the file `sir.in`.
2. Generate the sequence iteratively until the nth term.
3. Write the nth term to the file `sir.out`.

We will use file I/O for reading and writing, and avoid using `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, or `scanf()` as specified.

Below is the C++ code that accomplishes this:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

std::string getNextTerm(const std::string &current) {
    std::string next;
    int length = current.length();
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ) {
        char digit = current[i];
        int count = 0;
        while (i < length && current[i] == digit) {
            ++count;
            ++i;
        }
        next += std::to_string(count) + digit;
    }
    return next;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("sir.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("sir.out");
    
    int n;
    infile >> n;
    
    std::string term = "1";
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        term = getNextTerm(term);
    }
    
    outfile << term << std::endl;
    
    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the integer `n` from the file `sir.in`.
2. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - We start with the initial term `"1"`.
   - For each subsequent term, we use the `getNextTerm` function to generate the next term by counting consecutive digits in the current term.
3. **Writing Output**: We write the nth term to the file `sir.out`.

### Function `getNextTerm`:
- This function takes the current term as a string and generates the next term by counting consecutive digits and appending the count followed by the digit to the next term string.

### Efficiency:
- The iterative approach ensures that we only generate as many terms as needed, and the use of strings allows us to handle the potentially large size of terms efficiently.

This solution should be efficient and meet the requirements of the problem.
