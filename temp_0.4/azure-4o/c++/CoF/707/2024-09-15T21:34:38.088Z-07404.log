Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră următorul şir, construit astfel încât fiecare element al lui, cu excepţia primului, se obţine din cel precedent: $1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, \dots$
Termenii din şir sunt numerotaţi începând cu $1$.

# Cerință

Dat $n$, un număr natural, să se determine cel de-al $n$-lea termen din şirul dat.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găseste numarul $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se va găsi un singur număr întreg, al $n$-lea termen al sirului.

# Restricții și precizări

* $4 \leq n \leq 35$;
* numărul de cifre ale unui termen nu depăşeşte $17 \ 000$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the challenge of generating the nth term in the sequence, we need to understand the "look-and-say" sequence. Each term in the sequence is generated by describing the previous term. For example, starting from "1":

1. "1" is read as "one 1" → "11"
2. "11" is read as "two 1s" → "21"
3. "21" is read as "one 2, then one 1" → "1211"
4. "1211" is read as "one 1, one 2, then two 1s" → "111221"

Given the constraints (4 ≤ n ≤ 35), we can generate the sequence iteratively up to the nth term.

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

std::string nextTerm(const std::string &current) {
    std::string result;
    int count = 1;
    char digit = current[0];
    
    for (size_t i = 1; i < current.size(); ++i) {
        if (current[i] == digit) {
            ++count;
        } else {
            result += std::to_string(count) + digit;
            digit = current[i];
            count = 1;
        }
    }
    result += std::to_string(count) + digit;
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("sir.in");
    std::ofstream fout("sir.out");
    
    int n;
    fin >> n;
    
    std::string term = "1";
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        term = nextTerm(term);
    }
    
    fout << term << std::endl;
    
    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the integer `n` from the file `sir.in`.
2. **Generating the Sequence**: 
   - We start with the first term "1".
   - For each subsequent term up to the nth term, we generate the next term by counting consecutive digits in the current term.
   - The `nextTerm` function takes the current term as input and returns the next term in the sequence.
3. **Writing Output**: The nth term is written to the file `sir.out`.

### Function `nextTerm`:
- This function iterates over the current term, counts consecutive digits, and constructs the next term based on these counts.
- It uses a simple loop to traverse the string and keeps track of the current digit and its count.
- When a different digit is encountered, it appends the count and the digit to the result string and resets the count.

### Efficiency:
- The solution efficiently generates the sequence up to the 35th term using string operations.
- Given the constraints, the approach ensures that the solution is both correct and performant.
