Ștefan a împlinit 15 ani. Fiind un pasionat membru al Clubului de Robotică, familia i-a dăruit de ziua lui foarte mulți roboți, fiecare dotat cu o armă de o anumită putere. El a așezat toți roboții în jurul său, pe circumferința unui cerc imaginar, în sensul acelor de ceasornic. Aceste dispozitive inteligente pot comunica între ele, unindu-și puterile armelor.

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de roboți, precum și puterea fiecăruia, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. Dimensiunea celei mai lungi secvențe de roboți pentru care puterile armelor lor formează un șir strict crescător.
2. O aranjare a roboților pe cerc, astfel încât suma produselor de câte două puteri vecine să fie maximă. Dacă există mai multe modalităţi de aranjare astfel încât să se obţină aceeaşi sumă maximă, se va determina cea minimă din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `roboti.in` se găsește un număr natural $v$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.
Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsește un singur număr natural $n$ reprezentând numărul de roboți.
Pe a treia linie a fișierului de intrare se găsesc $n$ numere naturale $p_1$, $p_2$, $\dots$, $p_n$, separate prin câte un spațiu, $p_i$ reprezentând puterea armei robotului $i$.

# Date de ieşire
Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $1$, atunci fişierul de ieşire `roboti.out` va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând dimensiunea celei mai lungi secvențe de roboți pentru care puterile armelor lor formează un șir strict crescător.
Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $2$, atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie $n$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând puterile celor $n$ roboți așezați pe cerc astfel încât suma produselor de câte două puteri vecine să fie maximă, iar aşezarea să fie minimă din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $2 \leq n \leq 100\ 000$
- Pentru cerinţa 1, secvenţa de lungime maximă se alege pe cerc în sensul acelor de ceasornic.
- Dacă avem două şiruri de numere $[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$ şi $[b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n]$ şi există $1 \leq k \leq n$, cea mai mică poziţie, pentru care are loc $a_1 = b_1$, $a_2 = b_2$, $\dots$, $a_{k-1} = b_{k-1}$ şi $a_k < b_k$, atunci spunem că şirul $a$ este mai mic lexicografic decât şirul $b$.
- Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței 1 se acordă 30 de puncte, pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței 2 se acordă 60 de puncte, iar din oficiu se acordă 10 puncte.
- Pentru cerința 2, dacă soluția afișată nu este minimă lexicografic, dar produce suma maximă corectă se acordă $50\%$ din punctajul testului respectiv.
- Pentru cerința 2, teste în valoare totală de 36 de puncte vor avea $n \leq 1\ 000$.
- $1 \leq p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n \leq 1\ 000$

    } else if (v == 2) {
        solve2(powers, n, fout);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input from `roboti.in` using `ifstream`.
   - It reads the value `v` to determine which problem to solve.
   - It reads the number of robots `n` and their respective powers into a vector.

2. **Problem 1 (Longest Increasing Subsequence on a Circle)**:
   - The function `solve1` uses dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence.
   - It iterates through each pair of robots and updates the length of the longest subsequence ending at each robot.
   - The maximum length found is written to `roboti.out`.

3. **Problem 2 (Maximize Sum of Products of Adjacent Powers)**:
   - The function `solve2` sorts the powers in descending order and uses `prev_permutation` to generate all possible permutations.
   - It calculates the sum of products of adjacent powers for each permutation and keeps track of the maximum sum.
   - If multiple permutations result in the same maximum sum, it chooses the lexicographically smallest one.
   - The best arrangement is written to `roboti.out`.

### Performance Considerations:
- For Problem 1, the dynamic programming approach ensures a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for the given constraints.
- For Problem 2, the use of permutations is efficient for smaller values of `n` (up to around 1000). For larger values, a more sophisticated approach might be needed to handle the constraints efficiently.

Thank you for pointing out the issue. The discrepancy in the results for Problem 1 indicates that the initial solution did not correctly handle the circular nature of the problem. Let's address this by rethinking the approach for both problems.

### Problem 1: Longest Increasing Subsequence on a Circle
To handle the circular nature, we need to consider each robot as a potential starting point and calculate the longest increasing subsequence considering the wrap-around.

### Problem 2: Maximize Sum of Products of Adjacent Powers
The previous approach using permutations is inefficient for large values of `n`. Instead, we can sort the array and use a greedy approach to maximize the sum of products.

Here is the revised solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

void solve1(const vector<int>& powers, int n, ofstream& fout) {
    vector<int> extended_powers(2 * n);
    copy(powers.begin(), powers.end(), extended_powers.begin());
    copy(powers.begin(), powers.end(), extended_powers.begin() + n);

    vector<int> dp(2 * n, 1);
    int max_len = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0 && i - j < n; --j) {
            if (extended_powers[i] > extended_powers[j]) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        if (i >= n) {
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i]);
        }
    }

    fout << max_len << endl;
}

void solve2(vector<int> powers, int n, ofstream& fout) {
    sort(powers.begin(), powers.end());
    long long max_sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        max_sum += powers[i] * powers[(i + 1) % n];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << powers[i] << " ";
    }
    fout << endl;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roboti.in");
    ofstream fout("roboti.out");

    int v, n;
    fin >> v >> n;
    vector<int> powers(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> powers[i];
    }

    if (v == 1) {
        solve1(powers, n, fout);
    } else if (v == 2) {
        solve2(powers, n, fout);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input from `roboti.in` using `ifstream`.
   - It reads the value `v` to determine which problem to solve.
   - It reads the number of robots `n` and their respective powers into a vector.

2. **Problem 1 (Longest Increasing Subsequence on a Circle)**:
   - The function `solve1` extends the `powers` array to handle the circular nature by duplicating it.
   - It uses dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence for each potential starting point.
   - The maximum length found is written to `roboti.out`.

3. **Problem 2 (Maximize Sum of Products of Adjacent Powers)**:
   - The function `solve2` sorts the powers in ascending order.
   - It calculates the sum of products of adjacent powers for the sorted array.
   - The sorted array is written to `roboti.out` as it is already lexicographically smallest.

### Performance Considerations:
- For Problem 1, the dynamic programming approach ensures a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for the given constraints.
- For Problem 2, the sorting approach ensures a time complexity of O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

This revised solution should correctly handle the circular nature of the problem for Problem 1 and efficiently solve Problem 2.

Thank you for pointing out the issue with Problem 2. The discrepancy arises because the previous implementation simply sorted the array in ascending order, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of products of adjacent powers.

To solve Problem 2 correctly, we need to consider the circular nature and find an arrangement that maximizes the sum of products of adjacent powers. A more sophisticated approach is required to achieve this.

### Revised Approach for Problem 2:
1. **Sort the Powers**: Sort the powers in ascending order.
2. **Greedy Arrangement**: Arrange the powers in a way that maximizes the sum of products of adjacent powers. One effective way is to place the largest and smallest values alternately.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <deque>

using namespace std;

void solve1(const vector<int>& powers, int n, ofstream& fout) {
    vector<int> extended_powers(2 * n);
    copy(powers.begin(), powers.end(), extended_powers.begin());
    copy(powers.begin(), powers.end(), extended_powers.begin() + n);

    int max_len = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0 && i - j < n; --j) {
            if (extended_powers[i] > extended_powers[j]) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        if (i >= n) {
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i]);
        }
    }

    fout << max_len << endl;
}

void solve2(vector<int> powers, int n, ofstream& fout) {
    sort(powers.begin(), powers.end());

    deque<int> arrangement;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            arrangement.push_front(powers[i]);
        } else {
            arrangement.push_back(powers[i]);
        }
    }

    long long max_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        max_sum += arrangement[i] * arrangement[(i + 1) % n];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << arrangement[i] << " ";
    }
    fout << endl;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roboti.in");
    ofstream fout("roboti.out");

    int v, n;
    fin >> v >> n;
    vector<int> powers(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> powers[i];
    }

    if (v == 1) {
        solve1(powers, n, fout);
    } else if (v == 2) {
        solve2(powers, n, fout);
    }

    return 0;

}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input from `roboti.in` using `ifstream`.
   - It reads the value `v` to determine which problem to solve.
   - It reads the number of robots `n` and their respective powers into a vector.

2. **Problem 1 (Longest Increasing Subsequence on a Circle)**:
   - The function `solve1` extends the `powers` array to handle the circular nature by duplicating it.
   - It uses dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence for each potential starting point.
   - The maximum length found is written to `roboti.out`.

3. **Problem 2 (Maximize Sum of Products of Adjacent Powers)**:
   - The function `solve2` sorts the powers in ascending order.
   - It uses a two-pointer technique to arrange the powers such that the largest and smallest values are alternately placed while ensuring the arrangement is lexicographically smallest.
   - This arrangement tends to maximize the sum of products of adjacent powers.
   - The arrangement is written to `roboti.out`.

### Performance Considerations:
- For Problem 1, the dynamic programming approach ensures a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for the given constraints.
- For Problem 2, the sorting approach ensures a time complexity of O(n log n), and the two-pointer technique ensures an efficient solution.

This revised solution should correctly handle both problems and produce the expected results.

Thank you for pointing out the issue once again. The discrepancy arises because the previous implementation does not correctly handle the requirement to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement that maximizes the sum of products of adjacent powers.

To solve Problem 2 correctly, we need to:
1. **Sort the Powers**: Sort the powers in ascending order.
2. **Greedy Approach**: Arrange the powers to maximize the sum of products of adjacent powers while ensuring the arrangement is lexicographically smallest.

A more sophisticated approach is required to achieve this. We can use a combination of sorting and a two-pointer technique to ensure both the maximum sum and lexicographically smallest arrangement.

### Revised Approach for Problem 2:
1. **Sort the Powers**: Sort the powers in ascending order.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers to place the largest and smallest values alternately to maximize the sum of products while maintaining the lexicographically smallest order.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve1(const vector<int>& powers, int n, ofstream& fout) {
    vector<int> extended_powers(2 * n);
    copy(powers.begin(), powers.end(), extended_powers.begin());
    copy(powers.begin(), powers.end(), extended_powers.begin() + n);

    vector<int> dp(2 * n, 1);
    int max_len = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0 && i - j < n; --j) {
            if (extended_powers[i] > extended_powers[j]) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        if (i >= n) {
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i]);
        }
    }

    fout << max_len << endl;
}

void solve2(vector<int> powers, int n, ofstream& fout) {
    sort(powers.begin(), powers.end());

    vector<int> arrangement(n);
    int left = 0;
    int right = n - 1;
    bool placeLeft = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (placeLeft) {
            arrangement[left++] = powers[i];
        } else {
            arrangement[right--] = powers[i];
        }
        placeLeft = !placeLeft;
    }

    long long max_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        max_sum += arrangement[i] * arrangement[(i + 1) % n];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << arrangement[i] << " ";
    }
    fout << endl;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("roboti.in");
    ofstream fout("roboti.out");

    int v, n;
    fin >> v >> n;
    vector<int> powers(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> powers[i];
    }

    if (v == 1) {
        solve1(powers, n, fout);
    } else if (v == 2) {
        solve2(powers, n, fout);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
