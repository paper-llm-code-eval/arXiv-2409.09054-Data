Câţiva băieţi, după un fotbal mic, au hotărât să participe la jocul liber de volei al fetelor. Fetele sunt aşezate în cerc şi nu îşi schimbă locurile între ele. Un băiat se poate ataşa jocului fetelor numai dacă se aşează între două fete şi este mai înalt (strict) decât amândouă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând numărul de fete şi înălţimea fiecăreia, în ordinea în care se află ele pe cerc, numărul băieţilor şi înălţimea fiecăruia, se cere să se determine un număr maxim de băieţi care pot participa la joc şi poziţia ocupată de fiecare pe cerc.

# Date de intrare

Din fişierul text de intrare `volei.in` se citesc:

- de pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, numărul de fete din joc;
- de pe cea de a doua linie, $n$ numere naturale nenule despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând înălţimile fetelor, în ordinea de pe cerc, în sensul acelor de ceasornic, pornind de la o fată oarecare;
- de pe cea de a treia linie, un număr natural $m$, numărul de băieţi care vor să intre în joc;
- de pe cea de a patra linie, $m$ numere naturale nenule despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând înălţimile băieţilor care vor să intre în joc

# Date de ieșire

În fişierul text de ieşire `volei.out` se scriu:
- pe prima linie un număr natural $k$, reprezentând numărul maxim de băieţi care pot participa la joc;
- pe linia următoare, $n + k$ numere naturale, despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, numere reprezentând înălţimile jucătorilor de volei, în ordinea de pe cerc, în sensul acelor de ceasornic, pornind de la aceeaşi fată din fişierul de intrare, înălţimile băieţilor fiind scrise între paranteze.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \ 000$
* Înălțimile fetelor și a băieților nu depășesc valoarea $1\ 000$.
* Dacă există mai multe posibilităţi de a insera $k$ băieţi în joc, se va scrie una singură.
* Dacă numerele reprezentând înălţimile nu vi se par plauzibile, atunci puteţi considera că ele reprezintă coeficientul de inteligenţă al fiecărei persoane.
* Pentru afişarea valorii corecte a numărului $k$ se acordă 40 de puncte, iar pentru soluţia completă ($k$ maxim şi configuraţia corectă a celor $n + k$ înălţimi ale jucătorilor) se acordă 100 de puncte.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of girls `n` and their heights.
   - Then, it reads the number of boys `m` and their heights.

2. **Finding Valid Insertions:**
   - We iterate over each pair of adjacent girls (considering the circular arrangement).
   - For each pair, we check if there is any boy who is taller than both girls.
   - If such a boy is found, we mark him as used and record the insertion position.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - First, we output the number of valid insertions.
   - Then, we output the heights of the girls and insert the boys' heights in the correct positions.

This solution ensures that we find the maximum number of boys that can join the game by checking each possible insertion point and ensuring no boy is used more than once. The complexity is manageable given the constraints, and the solution should run efficiently within the provided limits.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the algorithm used in the initial solution does not correctly maximize the number of boys that can be inserted. Specifically, it fails to consider all possible valid insertions for each boy, leading to suboptimal results.

Here's a revised approach:
1. Sort the boys by height in descending order to prioritize taller boys.
2. For each boy, try to insert him between every pair of adjacent girls.
3. Use a greedy algorithm to ensure that we maximize the number of boys inserted.

Here is the corrected C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("volei.in");
    std::ofstream fout("volei.out");

    int n, m;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> girls(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> girls[i];
    }
    fin >> m;
    std::vector<int> boys(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        fin >> boys[i];
    }

    // Sort boys in descending order
    std::sort(boys.begin(), boys.end(), std::greater<int>());

    // To store the positions where boys will be inserted
    std::vector<int> insert_positions;
    std::vector<int> insert_heights;

    // To keep track of which boys have been used
    std::vector<bool> used(m, false);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int next = (i + 1) % n;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            if (!used[j] && boys[j] > girls[i] && boys[j] > girls[next]) {
                insert_positions.push_back(i + 1);
                insert_heights.push_back(boys[j]);
                used[j] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    fout << insert_positions.size() << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << girls[i] << " ";
        for (size_t j = 0; j < insert_positions.size(); ++j) {
            if (insert_positions[j] == i + 1) {
                fout << "(" << insert_heights[j] << ") ";
            }
        }
    }

Thank you for your patience. The issue with the previous solution lies in the approach of marking the girls' heights with a high value (1001) to indicate that the position has been used. This method is incorrect because it modifies the original girls' heights, which should not be changed.

Instead, we need to keep track of the positions where boys have been inserted without altering the original heights of the girls. We should also ensure that we correctly handle the circular nature of the arrangement.

Here is the corrected solution:

            if (!used[i] && !used[next] && boys[j] > girls[i] && boys[j] > girls[next]) {
                insertions.push_back({i, boys[j]});

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of girls `n` and their heights.
   - It then reads the number of boys `m` and their heights.

2. **Sorting Boys:**
   - The boys are sorted in descending order of height to prioritize inserting taller boys first.

3. **Finding Valid Insertions:**
   - For each boy, the program checks all pairs of adjacent girls to find a valid insertion point.
   - If a valid insertion point is found, the boy is inserted, and the position is marked as used.

4. **Sorting Insertions:**
   - The insertions are sorted by position to ensure the output is in the correct order.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - The number of valid insertions is printed.
   - The heights of the girls are printed, and the boys' heights are inserted in the correct positions.

This revised approach ensures that the maximum number of boys are inserted into the game by prioritizing taller boys and checking all possible insertion points. This should produce the correct output for the given example.

Thank you for your patience. The previous solutions did not correctly handle the insertion of boys in a way that maximizes their number. The main issue was that it did not correctly track all potential insertion points and prematurely marked positions as used.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are considering all possible positions for each boy and using a more systematic approach to maximize the number of boys inserted. We should also ensure that we correctly handle the circular nature of the arrangement.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("volei.in");
    std::ofstream fout("volei.out");

    int n, m;
    fin >> n;
    std::vector<int> girls(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fin >> girls[i];
    }
    fin >> m;
    std::vector<int> boys(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        fin >> boys[i];
    }

    // Sort boys in descending order
    std::sort(boys.begin(), boys.end(), std::greater<int>());

    // To store the positions where boys will be inserted
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> insertions;

    // To keep track of which positions have been used
    std::vector<bool> used(n, false);

    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int next = (i + 1) % n;
            if (!used[i] && !used[next] && boys[j] > girls[i] && boys[j] > girls[next]) {
                insertions.push_back({i, boys[j]});
                used[i] = used[next] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Sort insertions by position
    std::sort(insertions.begin(), insertions.end());

    // Output the result
    fout << insertions.size() << "\n";
    int insertion_index = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        fout << girls[i] << " ";
        if (insertion_index < insertions.size() && insertions[insertion_index].first == i) {
            fout << "(" << insertions[insertion_index].second << ") ";
            insertion_index++;
        }
    }
    fout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```
