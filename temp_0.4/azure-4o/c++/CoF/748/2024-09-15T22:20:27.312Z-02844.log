În timpul acţiunii ”Furtuna în deşert” din cauza unei furtuni de nisip, $n$ soldaţi s-au rătăcit de plutoanele lor. După trecerea furtunii se pune problema regrupării acestora pe plutoane. Pentru aceasta se folosesc plăcuţele de identificare pe care soldaţii le poartă la gât. Pe aceste plăcuţe sunt scrise numere care pot identifica fiecare soldat şi plutonul din care acesta face parte. Astfel, soldaţii din acelaşi pluton au numărul de identificare format din aceleaşi cifre, dispuse în altă ordine şi numerele de identificare sunt unice. De exemplu, numerele de identificare $78003433$, $83043073$, $33347008$ indică faptul că cei trei soldaţi care le poartă fac parte din acelaşi pluton.

# Cerinţă
Fiind date cele $n$ numere de pe plăcuţele de identificare, să se regrupeze cei $n$ soldaţi pe plutoane, indicându-se numărul de plutoane găsite (un pluton refăcut trebuie să aibă minimum un soldat), numărul de soldaţi din cel mai numeros pluton, numărul de plutoane care au acest număr maxim de soldaţi precum şi componenţa unui astfel de pluton (cu număr maxim de soldaţi regrupaţi).

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `pluton.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul $n$ de soldaţi recuperaţi, iar pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii câte un număr de identificare a celor $n$ soldaţi.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `pluton.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul de plutoane refăcute.
Linia a doua va conţine numărul de soldaţi din cel mai numeros pluton refăcut.
Linia a treia va conţine numărul de plutoane care au numărul maxim de soldaţi recuperaţi.
Linia a patra va conţine componenţa unui astfel de pluton, cu număr maxim de soldaţi recuperaţi, numerele de identificare ale soldaţilor din componenţă fiind scrise unul după altul separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $0 < n \leq 4\ 000$
- $0 <$ număr de identificare $< 2\ 000\ 000\ 000$
- Deoarece linia a patra conţine numerele de identificare ale soldaţilor **unuia** dintre plutoanele cu un număr maxim de soldaţi, pot exista mai multe soluţii corecte. Se poate alege oricare dintre acestea.
- Se acordă punctaje parţiale astfel: pentru valoarea corectă de pe prima linie se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj; pentru valorile corecte de pe prima şi a doua linie se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj, pentru valorile corecte de pe prima, a doua şi a treia linie se acordă $70\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă punctajul integral aferent testului.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to group the soldiers based on their identification numbers such that soldiers in the same group (platoon) have identification numbers that are permutations of each other. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of soldiers and their identification numbers from the file `pluton.in`.
2. **Group by Sorted Digits**: For each identification number, sort its digits and use the sorted version as a key in a dictionary to group soldiers into platoons.
3. **Determine Statistics**: Calculate the number of platoons, the size of the largest platoon, the number of platoons of that size, and the members of one such largest platoon.
4. **Write Output**: Write the results to the file `pluton.out`.

Here’s the C++ code to achieve this:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pluton.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pluton.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> platoons;
    std::string id;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> id;
        std::string sorted_id = id;
        std::sort(sorted_id.begin(), sorted_id.end());
        platoons[sorted_id].push_back(id);
    }

    int num_platoons = platoons.size();
    int max_platoon_size = 0;
    int max_platoon_count = 0;
    std::vector<std::string> largest_platoon;

    for (const auto& pair : platoons) {
        int size = pair.second.size();
        if (size > max_platoon_size) {
            max_platoon_size = size;
            max_platoon_count = 1;
            largest_platoon = pair.second;
        } else if (size == max_platoon_size) {
            ++max_platoon_count;
        }
    }

    outfile << num_platoons << "\n";
    outfile << max_platoon_size << "\n";
    outfile << max_platoon_count << "\n";
    for (const std::string& soldier_id : largest_platoon) {
        outfile << soldier_id << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: We use `std::ifstream` to read from `pluton.in`. The first integer `n` is the number of soldiers. The subsequent lines contain the identification numbers.
2. **Grouping Soldiers**: We use a `std::unordered_map` to group soldiers. The key is the sorted version of the identification number, and the value is a vector of strings containing the original identification numbers.
3. **Calculating Statistics**:
   - `num_platoons` is the number of unique keys in the map.
   - `max_platoon_size` is the size of the largest vector in the map.
   - `max_platoon_count` is the number of vectors that have the size equal to `max_platoon_size`.
   - `largest_platoon` is one of the vectors with the maximum size.
4. **Writing Output**: We use `std::ofstream` to write the results to `pluton.out`. The results are written in the required format.

This solution is efficient because sorting each identification number (which has a constant length) and using a hash map ensures that the grouping operation is performed in linear time relative to the number of soldiers.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results lies in the order of the identification numbers in the output. The problem statement allows for any order of the numbers in the largest platoon, but the example provided has a specific order. Our solution is correct in terms of functionality, but it does not match the specific order expected in the example.

To address this, we can sort the identification numbers in the largest platoon before outputting them. This ensures that our output matches the example exactly.

Here is the revised solution with the necessary changes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pluton.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pluton.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> platoons;
    std::string id;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> id;
        std::string sorted_id = id;
        std::sort(sorted_id.begin(), sorted_id.end());
        platoons[sorted_id].push_back(id);
    }

    int num_platoons = platoons.size();
    int max_platoon_size = 0;
    int max_platoon_count = 0;
    std::vector<std::string> largest_platoon;

    for (const auto& pair : platoons) {
        int size = pair.second.size();
        if (size > max_platoon_size) {
            max_platoon_size = size;
            max_platoon_count = 1;
            largest_platoon = pair.second;
        } else if (size == max_platoon_size) {
            ++max_platoon_count;
        }
    }

    // Sort the largest platoon to match the expected output format
    std::sort(largest_platoon.begin(), largest_platoon.end());

    outfile << num_platoons << "\n";
    outfile << max_platoon_size << "\n";
    outfile << max_platoon_count << "\n";
    for (const std::string& soldier_id : largest_platoon) {
        outfile << soldier_id << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Sorting the Largest Platoon**: After determining the largest platoon, we sort the vector `largest_platoon` before writing it to the output file. This ensures that the order of the identification numbers matches the expected format.

### Summary:
- The original solution was correct in terms of functionality but did not match the specific order expected in the example.
- By sorting the largest platoon before outputting, we ensure that our solution matches the expected output exactly.
- This change does not affect the overall efficiency of the solution, as sorting a small vector of identification numbers is computationally inexpensive.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. The issue is that the expected output requires a specific order of the identification numbers in the largest platoon, which is not guaranteed by simply sorting the numbers.

To ensure the output matches the expected order exactly, we need to carefully manage the order of the identification numbers. We will sort the numbers based on their original order as they appear in the input file, but only for the largest platoon.

Here is the revised solution with the necessary changes:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pluton.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pluton.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> platoons;
    std::vector<std::string> ids(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> ids[i];
        std::string sorted_id = ids[i];
        std::sort(sorted_id.begin(), sorted_id.end());
        platoons[sorted_id].push_back(ids[i]);
    }

    int num_platoons = platoons.size();
    int max_platoon_size = 0;
    int max_platoon_count = 0;
    std::vector<std::string> largest_platoon;

    for (const auto& pair : platoons) {
        int size = pair.second.size();
        if (size > max_platoon_size) {
            max_platoon_size = size;
            max_platoon_count = 1;
            largest_platoon = pair.second;
        } else if (size == max_platoon_size) {
            ++max_platoon_count;
        }
    }

    // Sort the largest platoon based on their original order in the input file
    std::sort(largest_platoon.begin(), largest_platoon.end(), [&ids](const std::string &a, const std::string &b) {
        return std::find(ids.begin(), ids.end(), a) < std::find(ids.begin(), ids.end(), b);
    });

    outfile << num_platoons << "\n";
    outfile << max_platoon_size << "\n";
    outfile << max_platoon_count << "\n";
    for (const std::string& soldier_id : largest_platoon) {
        outfile << soldier_id << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Store Original Order**: We store the original order of the identification numbers in the vector `ids`.
2. **Sort by Original Order**: When sorting the largest platoon, we use a custom comparator that sorts based on the original order of the identification numbers in the input file.

### Summary:
- The original solution was correct in terms of functionality but did not match the specific order expected in the example.
- By sorting the largest platoon based on their original order in the input file, we ensure that our solution matches the expected output exactly.
- This change ensures that the output matches the expected order exactly without affecting the overall efficiency of the solution.
