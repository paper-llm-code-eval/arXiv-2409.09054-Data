Fascinat de Egiptul Antic, Rareș vrea să construiască cât mai multe piramide din cartonașe pătratice identice. El are la dispoziție $N$ cartonașe numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, albe sau gri, așezate în ordinea strict crescătoare a numerelor.

Prima piramidă o va construi folosind primele trei cartonașe. Baza piramidei va fi formată din cartonașele $1$ și $2$ așezate alăturat, peste care va așeza cartonașul $3$ (vârful piramidei).

A doua piramidă va avea baza formată din cartonașele $4$, $5$ și $6$ așezate alăturat, deasupra cărora se vor așeza cartonașele $7$ și $8$, alăturate, peste care se va așeza cartonașul $9$ (vârful piramidei).

Mai departe, va construi în ordine piramidele complete cu bazele formate din $4$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $10$ la $13$), respectiv $5$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $20$ la $24$), $6$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $35$ la $40$) etc., cât timp va putea construi o piramidă completă. De exemplu, dacă Rareș are $N = 75$ cartonașe atunci el va construi piramidele complete $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ și $5$ din imaginile următoare. Din cele $75$ de cartonașe el va folosi doar primele $55$ de cartonașe, deoarece ultimele $20$ cartonașe nu sunt suficiente pentru a construi piramida $6$, cu baza formată din $7$ cartonașe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să citească numerele naturale $N$ (reprezentând numărul de cartonașe), $X$ (reprezentând numărul unui cartonaș), $K$ (reprezentând numărul de cartonașe albe), numerele celor $K$ cartonașe albe $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_K$ și care să determine: 

* numărul $P$ al piramidei complete ce conține cartonașul numerotat cu $X$; 
* numărul $M$ maxim de piramide complete construite de Rareș; 
* numărul $C$ de cartonașe nefolosite; 
* numărul $A$ al primei piramide complete care conține cele mai multe cartonașe albe. 

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `piramide.in` conține pe prima linie cele trei numere $N$, $X$ și $K$, separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. A doua linie a fișierului conține, în ordine, cele $K$ numere $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_K$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând numerele celor $K$ cartonașe albe din cele $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `piramide.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul $P$ sau valoarea $0$ (zero) dacă niciuna dintre piramidele complete construite nu conține cartonașul cu numărul $X$. 

A doua linie a fișierului va conține numărul $M$. 

Cea de-a treia linie va conține numărul $C$. 

Cea de-a patra linie va conține numărul $A$ sau valoarea $0$ (zero) dacă nicio piramidă completă nu conține cel puțin un cartonaș alb.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq a, b \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000$;
* $3 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$; 
* $1 \leq X \leq N$; 
* $1 \leq K \leq N$; 
* $1 \leq c_1 < c_2 <...< c_K \leq N$;
* O piramidă completă cu baza formată din $b$ cartonașe se construiește prin așezarea cartonașelor necesare pe $b$ rânduri: $b$ cartonașe pe primul rând (al bazei), apoi $b - 1$ cartonașe pe rândul al doilea, $b - 2$ pe rândul al treilea, $\dots$ , două cartonașe pe rândul $b - 1$ și un cartonaș (vârful piramidei) pe rândul $b$.
* Pentru rezolvarea cerinței a) se acordă 20% din punctaj, pentru cerința b) 20% din punctaj, pentru cerința c) 20% din punctaj și pentru cerința d) 40% din punctaj.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input values from `piramide.in` file.
2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes variables to keep track of total cards used, the current pyramid base, number of pyramids, etc.
3. **Pyramid Construction**:
   - It iterates to construct pyramids, calculating the number of cards needed for each pyramid.
   - It stops if the total number of cards exceeds `N`.
4. **Determining Results**:
   - It checks if the current pyramid contains the card `X`.
   - It counts the number of white cards in the current pyramid.
   - It updates the maximum number of white cards and the corresponding pyramid.
5. **Output**: The results are written to `piramide.out` file.

This solution efficiently calculates the required values by iterating through potential pyramids and checking conditions, ensuring optimal performance.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there is a logical error in the current implementation. Specifically, the calculation of the number of cards in each pyramid and the tracking of the white cards within each pyramid seem to be incorrect.

To address this, let's re-evaluate the problem and the logic needed to solve it:

1. **Pyramid Construction**:
   - The number of cards required for a pyramid with a base of `b` cards is given by the sum of the first `b` natural numbers, i.e., \( \frac{b(b+1)}{2} \).
   - We need to keep track of the total number of cards used so far and stop when this exceeds `N`.

2. **Determine the Pyramid Containing Card `X`**:
   - As we construct each pyramid, we should check if `X` lies within the range of card numbers used for the current pyramid.

3. **Count White Cards in Each Pyramid**:
   - For each pyramid, count how many of the white cards fall within the range of card numbers used for that pyramid.

4. **Output the Results**:
   - The pyramid containing `X`, the total number of complete pyramids, the number of unused cards, and the pyramid with the most white cards.

Let's implement this with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream inFile("piramide.in");
    std::ofstream outFile("piramide.out");

    std::vector<int> whiteCards(K);
    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
        inFile >> whiteCards[i];
    }

    int totalCards = 0;
    int pyramidBase = 0;
    int pyramidCount = 0;
    int pyramidWithX = 0;
    int maxPyramids = 0;
    int unusedCards = N;
    int maxWhiteCards = 0;
    int pyramidWithMaxWhite = 0;

    for (int i = 1; ; ++i) {
        int cardsInPyramid = i * (i + 1) / 2;
        if (totalCards + cardsInPyramid > N) {
            break;
        }
        totalCards += cardsInPyramid;
        ++pyramidCount;

        if (X <= totalCards && pyramidWithX == 0) {
            pyramidWithX = pyramidCount;
        }

        int whiteCount = 0;
        for (int j = totalCards - cardsInPyramid + 1; j <= totalCards; ++j) {
            if (std::binary_search(whiteCards.begin(), whiteCards.end(), j)) {
                ++whiteCount;
            }
        }

        if (whiteCount > maxWhiteCards) {
            maxWhiteCards = whiteCount;
            pyramidWithMaxWhite = pyramidCount;
        }
    }

    unusedCards = N - totalCards;

    outFile << (pyramidWithX == 0 ? 0 : pyramidWithX) << "\n";
    outFile << pyramidCount << "\n";
    outFile << unusedCards << "\n";
    outFile << (pyramidWithMaxWhite == 0 ? 0 : pyramidWithMaxWhite) << "\n";

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

2. **Initial Setup**: Variables are initialized to keep track of the total number of cards used, the current pyramid base, number of pyramids, etc.

   - If adding the current pyramid exceeds `N`, break the loop.
   - Update the total number of cards used and the count of pyramids.

The differences between the expected and found results indicate that there is a logical error in the current implementation. Specifically, the calculation of the total cards used and the number of complete pyramids needs to be re-evaluated.

### Analysis:
1. **Pyramid Construction**:
   - The number of cards required for a pyramid with a base of `b` cards is given by the sum of the first `b` natural numbers, i.e., \( \frac{b(b+1)}{2} \).
   - We need to keep track of the total number of cards used so far and stop when this exceeds `N`.

2. **Determine the Pyramid Containing Card `X`**:
   - As we construct each pyramid, we should check if `X` lies within the range of card numbers used for the current pyramid.

3. **Count White Cards in Each Pyramid**:
   - For each pyramid, count how many of the white cards fall within the range of card numbers used for that pyramid.

4. **Output the Results**:
   - The pyramid containing `X`, the total number of complete pyramids, the number of unused cards, and the pyramid with the most white cards.

Let's implement this with the correct logic:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream inFile("piramide.in");
    std::ofstream outFile("piramide.out");

    int N, X, K;
    inFile >> N >> X >> K;

    std::vector<int> whiteCards(K);
    for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
        inFile >> whiteCards[i];
    }

    int totalCards = 0;
    int pyramidBase = 0;
    int pyramidCount = 0;
    int pyramidWithX = 0;
    int maxPyramids = 0;
    int unusedCards = N;
    int maxWhiteCards = 0;
    int pyramidWithMaxWhite = 0;

    for (int i = 1; ; ++i) {
        int cardsInPyramid = i * (i + 1) / 2;
        if (totalCards + cardsInPyramid > N) {
            break;
        }
        totalCards += cardsInPyramid;
        ++pyramidCount;

        if (X <= totalCards && pyramidWithX == 0) {
            pyramidWithX = pyramidCount;
        }

        int whiteCount = 0;
        for (int j = totalCards - cardsInPyramid + 1; j <= totalCards; ++j) {
            if (std::binary_search(whiteCards.begin(), whiteCards.end(), j)) {
                ++whiteCount;
            }
        }

        if (whiteCount > maxWhiteCards) {
            maxWhiteCards = whiteCount;
            pyramidWithMaxWhite = pyramidCount;
        }
    }

    unusedCards = N - totalCards;

    outFile << (pyramidWithX == 0 ? 0 : pyramidWithX) << "\n";
    outFile << pyramidCount << "\n";
    outFile << unusedCards << "\n";
    outFile << (pyramidWithMaxWhite == 0 ? 0 : pyramidWithMaxWhite) << "\n";

    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

            break;
        }
        ++pyramidCount;
        totalCards += cardsInPyramid;

        if (X <= totalCards && pyramidWithX == 0) {
            pyramidWithX = pyramidCount;
        }

        int whiteCount = 0;
        for (int j = totalCards - cardsInPyramid + 1; j <= totalCards; ++j) {
            if (std::binary_search(whiteCards.begin(), whiteCards.end(), j)) {
                ++whiteCount;

        if (whiteCount > maxWhiteCards) {
            maxWhiteCards = whiteCount;
            pyramidWithMaxWhite = pyramidCount;

    outFile.close();
