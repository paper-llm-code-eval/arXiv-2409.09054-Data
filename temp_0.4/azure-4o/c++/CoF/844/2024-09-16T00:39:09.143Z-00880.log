_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the logic for finding the largest number that can be printed with exactly \( K \) points is flawed. Specifically, the approach of using as many '8's as possible and then filling the remaining points with the largest possible digit does not always yield the correct result.

Let's break down the problem and the solution:

1. **Finding the Largest Digit with Minimum Points in \( N \)**:
   - This part of the solution works correctly. We iterate through each digit of \( N \) and determine the digit that requires the minimum number of points to print. If there are multiple such digits, we choose the largest one.

2. **Finding the Largest Number that Can Be Printed with Exactly \( K \) Points**:
   - The current approach tries to use as many '8's as possible and then fills the remaining points with the largest possible digit. This is incorrect because it does not always yield the largest possible number.
   - Instead, we should consider constructing the number digit by digit, ensuring that we maximize each digit while exactly using up \( K \) points.

### Corrected Approach:
- For the first part, we keep the existing logic as it is correct.
- For the second part, we need a different approach. We should:
  1. Determine the maximum number of digits we can print with \( K \) points.
  2. Construct the number from the most significant digit to the least significant digit, ensuring that we maximize each digit while exactly using up \( K \) points.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Number of points required to print each digit
const vector<int> points = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the largest digit with minimum points in N
char findLargestDigitWithMinPoints(const string& N) {
    int minPoints = 7; // Maximum points for a digit is 7 (for '8')
    char result = '0';
    
    for (char digit : N) {
        int digitPoints = points[digit - '0'];
        if (digitPoints < minPoints) {
            minPoints = digitPoints;
            result = digit;
        } else if (digitPoints == minPoints && digit > result) {
            result = digit;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Function to find the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points

    // Determine the maximum number of digits we can print with K points
    int numDigits = 0;
    while (K >= 2) {
        numDigits++;
        K -= 2;
    }
    
    // Construct the largest number digit by digit
    for (int i = 0; i < numDigits; ++i) {
        for (int d = 9; d >= 0; --d) {
            if (K + points[d] >= 2) {
                result += (char)('0' + d);
                K -= points[d] - 2;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

    string N_str = to_string(N);
    
    // Find the largest digit with minimum points in N
    char largestDigitWithMinPoints = findLargestDigitWithMinPoints(N_str);
    
    // Find the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string largestNumberWithKPoints = findLargestNumberWithKPoints(K);
    
    // Write the results to the output file
    outFile << largestDigitWithMinPoints << endl;
    outFile << largestNumberWithKPoints << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Finding the Largest Digit with Minimum Points in \( N \)**:
   - This part remains unchanged as it correctly identifies the digit with the minimum number of points.

2. **Finding the Largest Number that Can Be Printed with Exactly \( K \) Points**:
   - First, determine the maximum number of digits we can print with \( K \) points.
   - Then, construct the largest possible number by iterating from the most significant digit to the least significant digit, ensuring that we maximize each digit while exactly using up \( K \) points.

This approach ensures that we accurately construct the largest possible number with exactly \( K \) points.

The discrepancy arises because the logic for constructing the largest number with exactly \( K \) points is still flawed. The approach of maximizing each digit from the most significant to the least significant does not always yield the correct result. Specifically, it does not consider combinations of digits that might better utilize the remaining points.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are constructing the largest possible number by considering all possible combinations of digits that sum up to exactly \( K \) points.

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Finding the Largest Digit with Minimum Points in \( N \)**:
   - This part remains correct as it correctly identifies the digit with the minimum number of points.

2. **Finding the Largest Number that Can Be Printed with Exactly \( K \) Points**:
   - We need to construct the number by considering all possible combinations of digits that sum up to exactly \( K \) points.
   - We can use a dynamic programming approach to find the largest number.

Here is the corrected solution:

    char result = '0';
    
    for (char digit : N) {
        int digitPoints = points[digit - '0'];
        if (digitPoints < minPoints) {
            minPoints = digitPoints;
            result = digit;
        } else if (digitPoints == minPoints && digit > result) {
            result = digit;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Function to find the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
string findLargestNumberWithKPoints(int K) {
    // dp[i] will store the largest number that can be formed with i points
    vector<string> dp(K + 1, "");

    // Initialize dp array with single digits
    for (int d = 0; d <= 9; ++d) {
        if (points[d] <= K) {
            dp[points[d]] = string(1, '0' + d);
        }
    }

    // Build up the dp array for all points from 1 to K
    for (int i = 2; i <= K; ++i) {
        for (int d = 0; d <= 9; ++d) {
            if (i >= points[d] && !dp[i - points[d]].empty()) {
                string candidate = dp[i - points[d]] + (char)('0' + d);
                if (candidate.length() > dp[i].length() || (candidate.length() == dp[i].length() && candidate > dp[i])) {
                    dp[i] = candidate;
                }
            }

---------- assistant ----------

The discrepancy arises because the dynamic programming approach in the previous solution prioritizes the construction of the longest possible number rather than the largest possible number. This results in the solution "11111111" instead of "74".

To address this, we need to ensure that we are constructing the largest possible number in terms of value, not just length. Specifically, we need to consider the value of the digits more carefully when constructing the number.

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Finding the Largest Digit with Minimum Points in \( N \)**:
   - This part remains correct as it correctly identifies the digit with the minimum number of points.

2. **Finding the Largest Number that Can Be Printed with Exactly \( K \) Points**:
   - We need to construct the number by considering the largest possible digits first while ensuring the total points used is exactly \( K \).
   - We can use a greedy approach to achieve this.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was terminated by the operating system, often due to excessive memory usage or running out of memory. Given that the previous solution used a greedy approach, it should not have caused excessive memory usage.

The discrepancy arises because the greedy approach does not always yield the correct result. Specifically, the greedy approach might select digits that fit within the remaining points but do not necessarily form the largest possible number. For example, selecting '9' (6 points) and '7' (3 points) instead of two '7's (3 points each) can lead to suboptimal results.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are constructing the largest possible number by considering all possible combinations of digits that sum up to exactly \( K \) points. We can use a dynamic programming approach to achieve this.

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Finding the Largest Digit with Minimum Points in \( N \)**:
   - Iterate through each digit of \( N \) and determine the digit that requires the minimum number of points to print. If there are multiple such digits, choose the largest one.

2. **Finding the Largest Number that Can Be Printed with Exactly \( K \) Points**:
   - Use dynamic programming to build the largest number that can be formed with exactly \( K \) points.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Number of points required to print each digit
const vector<int> points = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};

// Function to find the largest digit with minimum points in N
char findLargestDigitWithMinPoints(const string& N) {
    int minPoints = 7; // Maximum points for a digit is 7 (for '8')
    char result = '0';
    
    for (char digit : N) {
        int digitPoints = points[digit - '0'];
        if (digitPoints < minPoints) {
            minPoints = digitPoints;
            result = digit;
        } else if (digitPoints == minPoints && digit > result) {
            result = digit;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Function to find the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
string findLargestNumberWithKPoints(int K) {
    // dp[i] will store the largest number that can be formed with i points
    vector<string> dp(K + 1, "");
    
    // Initialize dp array with single digits
    for (int d = 0; d <= 9; ++d) {
        if (points[d] <= K) {
            dp[points[d]] = string(1, '0' + d);
        }
    }
    
    // Build up the dp array for all points from 1 to K
    for (int i = 2; i <= K; ++i) {
        for (int d = 0; d <= 9; ++d) {
            if (i >= points[d] && !dp[i - points[d]].empty()) {
                string candidate = dp[i - points[d]] + (char)('0' + d);
                if (candidate.length() > dp[i].length() || (candidate.length() == dp[i].length() && candidate > dp[i])) {
                    dp[i] = candidate;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[K];
}

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("imprimanta.in");
    ofstream outFile("imprimanta.out");
    
    long long N;
    int K;
    inFile >> N >> K;
    
    // Convert N to string to process each digit
    string N_str = to_string(N);
    
    // Find the largest digit with minimum points in N
    char largestDigitWithMinPoints = findLargestDigitWithMinPoints(N_str);
    
    // Find the largest number that can be printed with exactly K points
    string largestNumberWithKPoints = findLargestNumberWithKPoints(K);
    
    // Write the results to the output file
    outFile << largestDigitWithMinPoints << endl;
    outFile << largestNumberWithKPoints << endl;
    
    inFile.close();
    outFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Finding the Largest Digit with Minimum Points in \( N \)**:
   - This part remains unchanged as it correctly identifies the digit with the minimum number of points.

2. **Finding the Largest Number that Can Be Printed with Exactly \( K \) Points**:
   - We use dynamic programming to build the largest number that can be formed with exactly \( K \) points.
   - We initialize the `dp` array with single digits.
   - We then build up the `dp` array for all points from 1 to \( K \), ensuring that we always form the largest possible number.

This approach ensures that we accurately construct the largest possible number with exactly \( K \) points by considering all possible combinations of digits.

The discrepancy arises because the dynamic programming approach in the previous solution prioritizes the construction of the longest possible number rather than the largest possible number. This results in the solution "11111111" instead of "74".

To address this, we need to ensure that we are constructing the largest possible number in terms of value, not just length. Specifically, we need to consider the value of the digits more carefully when constructing the number.

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Find the Largest Digit with Minimum Points in \( N \)**:
   - Iterate through each digit of \( N \) and determine the digit that requires the minimum number of points to print. If there are multiple such digits, choose the largest one.

2. **Find the Largest Number that Can Be Printed with Exactly \( K \) Points**:
   - Use a greedy approach to construct the largest possible number by always selecting the largest possible digit that can fit within the remaining points.

            minPoints = digitPoints;
            result = digit;
        } else if (digitPoints == minPoints && digit > result) {
