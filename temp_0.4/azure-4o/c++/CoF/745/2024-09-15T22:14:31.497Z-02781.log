Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

6 6 3 4 4

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this challenge optimally, we need to use dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the minimum sum required to reach each cell in the matrix, considering the traversal rules. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: Read the input from the file and store it in a matrix.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum to reach cell `(i, j)` from the start `(0, 0)`.
3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For the first row, the only way to reach any cell is by horizontal jumps from the starting cell.
   - For subsequent rows, calculate the minimum sum for each cell by considering all possible horizontal jumps from the previous row and then adding the current cell value.
4. **Final Step**: The answer will be the minimum value in the last row since we can jump directly to the last cell in the final step.

Here's the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("lacusta.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("lacusta.out");

    int m, n;
    infile >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            infile >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m, std::vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0];

    // Fill the first row
    for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
        dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j];
    }

    // Fill the rest of the dp table
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the minimum value in the last row
    int result = INT_MAX;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        result = std::min(result, dp[m-1][j]);
    }

    outfile << result << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `lacusta.in` and stored in a 2D vector `matrix`.
2. **DP Table Initialization**: A DP table `dp` is initialized with `INT_MAX` to represent initially unreachable cells.
3. **First Row**: The first row of the DP table is filled directly from the matrix since the only way to reach any cell in the first row is by horizontal jumps from the starting cell.
4. **Filling the DP Table**: For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, we consider all possible cells `(i-1, k)` from the previous row and update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum sum.
5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value in the last row of the DP table is the answer, which is written to `lacusta.out`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum sum required for the traversal while adhering to the problem constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the initial approach did not correctly account for the traversal rules specified in the problem. Specifically, the problem requires that each move consists of a horizontal jump followed by a vertical step, except for the last move, which is only a horizontal jump.

To fix this, we need to ensure that each move from row `i` to row `i+1` correctly considers all possible horizontal jumps in row `i` and then adds the value of the cell in row `i+1`.

Here's the corrected approach:

1. **Initialization**: Read the input from the file and store it in a matrix.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum to reach cell `(i, j)` from the start `(0, 0)`.

   - For the first row, the only way to reach any cell is by horizontal jumps from the starting cell.

        }
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m, std::vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0];

    // Fill the first row
    for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
        dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j];
    }

                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the minimum value in the last row
    int result = INT_MAX;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {

Upon reevaluating the problem, it is clear that the initial approach did not correctly account for the specific traversal rules: each move consists of a horizontal jump followed by a vertical step, except for the last move which is only a horizontal jump. This means we need to handle the transitions between rows more carefully.

Here's a revised approach to solve the problem:

1. **Initialization**: Read the input from the file and store it in a matrix.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `lacusta.in` and stored in a 2D vector `matrix`.
2. **DP Table Initialization**: A DP table `dp` is initialized with `INT_MAX` to represent initially unreachable cells.
3. **First Row**: The first row of the DP table is filled directly from the matrix since the only way to reach any cell in the first row is by horizontal jumps from the starting cell.
4. **Filling the DP Table**: For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, we consider all possible cells `(i-1, k)` from the previous row (excluding the same column `j`) and update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum sum.
5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value in the last row of the DP table is the answer, which is written to `lacusta.out`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum sum required for the traversal while adhering to the problem constraints.

The previous solutions did not correctly account for the traversal rules, particularly the requirement that each move consists of a horizontal jump followed by a vertical step, except for the last move which is only a horizontal jump. This means we need to handle the transitions between rows more carefully and ensure that the sum calculation correctly considers all possible paths.

To address this, we need to:
1. Ensure that each move from row `i` to row `i+1` correctly considers all possible horizontal jumps in row `i` and then adds the value of the cell in row `i+1`.
2. Properly handle the case where we can jump directly to the last cell in the final step.

Here's the corrected approach:

1. **Initialization**: Read the input from the file and store it in a matrix.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum to reach cell `(i, j)` from the start `(0, 0)`.
3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For the first row, the only way to reach any cell is directly from the start.
   - For subsequent rows, calculate the minimum sum for each cell by considering all possible horizontal jumps in the previous row and then adding the current cell value.
4. **Final Step**: The answer will be the minimum value in the last row since we can jump directly to the last cell in the final step.

Here is the corrected C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("lacusta.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("lacusta.out");

    int m, n;
    infile >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            infile >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m, std::vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

    // Initialize the first row
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j];
    }

    // Fill the rest of the dp table
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (k != j) { // Ensure we don't jump to the same column
                    dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the minimum value in the last row
    int result = INT_MAX;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        result = std::min(result, dp[m-1][j]);
    }

    outfile << result << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
