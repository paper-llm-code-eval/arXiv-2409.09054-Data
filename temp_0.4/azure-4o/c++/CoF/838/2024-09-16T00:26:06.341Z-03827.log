Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `calcule.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a greedy algorithm with a `std::vector` to keep track of the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences.
   - For each element in the sequence, we use `std::upper_bound` to find the position where the current element can replace to maintain the increasing order.
   - The size of this vector at the end gives the minimum number of subsequences.
3. **Part b - Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by k**:
   - We use a dynamic programming approach with a `dp` array where `dp[j]` represents the number of subsequences with sum modulo `k` equal to `j`.
   - We iterate through each element and update the `dp` array accordingly.
   - Finally, `dp[0]` (subtracting 1 to exclude the empty sequence) gives the number of subsequences with sum divisible by `k`.
4. **Writing Output**: The results are written to `calcule.out` using `ofstream`.

This solution ensures efficient handling of the input size constraints and performs the required calculations in an optimal manner.

Let's evaluate the differences and identify the issues in the previous solution:

### Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences
The previous solution used a greedy approach with a vector to track the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences. This approach is correct for finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), but it does not directly give the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the sequence.

### Part b - Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by k
The dynamic programming approach used to count subsequences with sums divisible by `k` was incorrect. Specifically, the approach did not correctly handle the modulo operation and updating of the `dp` array.

### Correct Approach
1. **Part a**: To find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences, we can use a greedy algorithm that iteratively partitions the sequence.
2. **Part b**: We need to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to count the number of contiguous subsequences with sums divisible by `k`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part a) Find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    std::vector<int> dp(n, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (S[i] > S[j]) {
                dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    int min_subsequences = *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());

    // Part b) Find the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    std::vector<int> count(k, 0);
    count[0] = 1;
    int current_sum = 0;
    int sequences_divisible_by_k = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        current_sum = (current_sum + S[i]) % k;
        sequences_divisible_by_k = (sequences_divisible_by_k + count[current_sum]) % MOD;
        count[current_sum]++;
    }

    outfile << min_subsequences << "\n" << sequences_divisible_by_k << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `calcule.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - We iterate through each pair of indices `(i, j)` and update the `dp` array accordingly.
   - The maximum value in the `dp` array gives the length of the longest increasing subsequence, which is the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the sequence.
3. **Part b - Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by k**:
   - We use a dynamic programming approach with a `count` array where `count[j]` represents the number of contiguous subsequences with sum modulo `k` equal to `j`.
   - We iterate through each element and update the `count` array accordingly.
   - Finally, we sum up the values in the `count` array to get the number of contiguous subsequences with sums divisible by `k`.
4. **Writing Output**: The results are written to `calcule.out` using `ofstream`.

This solution ensures efficient handling of the input size constraints and performs the required calculations in an optimal manner.

It appears that the previous solution now correctly matches the expected output for the given input. However, to ensure robustness and correctness, let's re-examine the logic and refine it if necessary.

### Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences
The previous solution used a dynamic programming approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), which is correct. However, the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the sequence is actually the length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). This is because each element in the LDS can be the start of a new increasing subsequence.

### Part b - Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by k
The dynamic programming approach used to count subsequences with sums divisible by `k` is correct. We need to ensure that we correctly handle the modulo operation and update the `dp` array.

Here's the refined solution:

#include <fstream>

        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (S[i] > S[j]) {
                dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    int min_subsequences = *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());

    // Part b) Find the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    std::vector<int> count(k, 0);
    count[0] = 1;
    int current_sum = 0;
    int sequences_divisible_by_k = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        current_sum = (current_sum + S[i]) % k;
        sequences_divisible_by_k = (sequences_divisible_by_k + count[current_sum]) % MOD;
        count[current_sum]++;
    }

    outfile << min_subsequences << "\n" << sequences_divisible_by_k << "\n";

The previous solution is producing the correct results for the given input. However, since the prompt is asking to re-evaluate and ensure the solution is robust, let's break down each part again and ensure the logic is sound.

### Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences
The problem is to find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences needed to partition the sequence. This can be correctly solved using a greedy algorithm with patience sorting, which is effectively finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).

### Part b - Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by k
The problem is to count the number of contiguous subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`. This can be solved using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to count occurrences of each modulo value.

Here's the refined solution with detailed comments for clarity:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part a) Find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    std::vector<int> lis;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto it = std::upper_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), S[i]);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(S[i]);
        } else {
            *it = S[i];
        }
    }
    int min_subsequences = lis.size();

    // Part b) Find the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    std::unordered_map<int, int> prefix_count;
    prefix_count[0] = 1;  // There's one way to have a sum of 0 (the empty subarray)
    int current_sum = 0;
    int sequences_divisible_by_k = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        current_sum = (current_sum + S[i]) % k;
        if (current_sum < 0) current_sum += k;  // Ensure non-negative modulo
        sequences_divisible_by_k = (sequences_divisible_by_k + prefix_count[current_sum]) % MOD;
        prefix_count[current_sum]++;
    }

    outfile << min_subsequences << "\n" << sequences_divisible_by_k << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `calcule.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a greedy algorithm with patience sorting to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).
   - For each element in the sequence, we use `std::upper_bound` to find the position where the current element can replace to maintain the increasing order.
   - The size of this vector at the end gives the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the sequence.
3. **Part b - Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by k**:
   - We use a prefix sum approach with a hash map to count occurrences of each modulo value.

Thank you for your patience. Let's re-evaluate the solution for Part a) in detail since the output for Part b) is correct but Part a) is not. 

### Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences
The goal is to partition the sequence into the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences. The correct approach is to use a greedy algorithm that constructs these subsequences dynamically.

The previous approach using patience sorting was incorrect for this specific problem. Instead, we need to use a different greedy method that ensures each element is placed in the first subsequence where it can be appended to maintain the increasing order.

### Correct Approach for Part a)
1. Use a greedy algorithm to track the end elements of current subsequences.
2. For each element in the sequence, place it in the first subsequence where it can be appended to maintain the increasing order.
3. If no such subsequence exists, start a new subsequence.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

const int MOD = 20011;

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("calcule.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("calcule.out");

    int n, k;
    infile >> n >> k;

    std::vector<int> S(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> S[i];
    }

    // Part a) Find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences
    std::vector<int> ends; // This will store the end elements of the current subsequences
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(ends.begin(), ends.end(), S[i]);
        if (it == ends.end()) {
            ends.push_back(S[i]);
        } else {
            *it = S[i];
        }
    }
    int min_subsequences = ends.size();

    // Part b) Find the number of sequences with sum divisible by k
    std::unordered_map<int, int> prefix_count;
    prefix_count[0] = 1;  // There's one way to have a sum of 0 (the empty subarray)
    int current_sum = 0;
    int sequences_divisible_by_k = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        current_sum = (current_sum + S[i]) % k;
        if (current_sum < 0) current_sum += k;  // Ensure non-negative modulo
        sequences_divisible_by_k = (sequences_divisible_by_k + prefix_count[current_sum]) % MOD;
        prefix_count[current_sum]++;
    }

    outfile << min_subsequences << "\n" << sequences_divisible_by_k << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `calcule.in` using `ifstream`.
2. **Part a - Minimum Number of Strictly Increasing Subsequences**:
   - We use a greedy algorithm with a vector `ends` to track the end elements of the current subsequences.
   - For each element in the sequence, we use `std::lower_bound` to find the first subsequence where the current element can be appended to maintain the increasing order.
   - If no such subsequence exists, we start a new subsequence by appending the element to `ends`.
   - The size of the `ends` vector at the end gives the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences required to partition the sequence.
3. **Part b - Number of Sequences with Sum Divisible by k**:
   - We use a prefix sum approach with a hash map to count occurrences of each modulo value.
   - We iterate through each element and update the prefix sum and the hash map accordingly.
   - The count of subarrays with sum divisible by `k` is accumulated in `sequences_divisible_by_k`.
4. **Writing Output**: The results are written to `calcule.out` using `ofstream`.

This solution ensures efficient handling of the input size constraints and performs the required calculations in an optimal manner.
