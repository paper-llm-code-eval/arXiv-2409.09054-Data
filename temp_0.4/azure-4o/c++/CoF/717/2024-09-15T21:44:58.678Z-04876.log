Here is a programming challenge. Points will be awarded for fastest code execution.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in c++. The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `cin >>` or `cout <<` or `printf()` or `scanf()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Să considerăm următorul şir:

`a`$,$ `b`$,$ `ba`$,$ `bab`$,$ `babba`$,$ `babbabab`$, \dots$

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine care este cel de-al $n$-lea termen al şirului

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `sir.in` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul natural $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `sir.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care se află al $n$-lea termen din şir

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 20$;

Example:
`sir.in`
```

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to generate the sequence iteratively up to the nth term. Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), we can afford to generate each term by appending the previous terms in a specific manner.

Here is the C++ solution that reads from `sir.in` and writes to `sir.out` without using `cin`, `cout`, `printf()`, or `scanf()`:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("sir.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("sir.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    std::vector<std::string> sequence;
    sequence.push_back("a");
    sequence.push_back("b");

    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        sequence.push_back(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]);
    }

    outfile << sequence[n-1] << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the integer `n` from the file `sir.in`.
2. **Generating Sequence**: 
   - We initialize the sequence with the first two terms: "a" and "b".
   - For each subsequent term, we concatenate the previous two terms in the sequence.
3. **Output**: The program writes the nth term of the sequence to the file `sir.out`.

### Example Verification:
For `n = 4`, the sequence generated would be:
- Term 1: "a"
- Term 2: "b"
- Term 3: "ba"
- Term 4: "bab"

The output for `n = 4` is correctly "bab".
