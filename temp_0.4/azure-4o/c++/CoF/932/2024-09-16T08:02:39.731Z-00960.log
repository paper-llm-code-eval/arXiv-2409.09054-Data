La o cursă de Formula 1, fiecare echipă participantă își construiește propria mașină cu care va concura. Numerotarea mașinilor în concurs este realizată de organizatori cu ajutorul unor stegulețe pătrate ce conțin alternativ, pe fiecare rând (pe orizontală și verticală), pătrățele albe și negre de dimensiuni identice. În figura următoare sunt prezentate, în ordine, stegulețele primelor 4 mașini din concurs. Observăm că fiecare steguleț are cu două rânduri (pe orizontală și verticală) mai mult decât stegulețul precedent, iar în toate cele patru colțuri ale oricărui steguleț se află un pătrățel negru.

~[formula1.jpg]

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește două numere naturale $K$ și $N$ și determină:

1. Câte pătrățele albe și negre sunt în total pe stegulețul mașinii cu numărul $K$;
2. Notând cu $A$ numărul total de pătrățele albe de pe stegulețele primelor $N$ mașini din concurs, câte pătrățele albe și negre sunt în total pe cel mai mare steguleț care conține cel mult $A$ pătrățele albe.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `formula1.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$. Pentru toate testele de intrare, numărul $C$ poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau valoarea $2$ și reprezintă numărul cerinței care trebuie rezolvată. Pe a doua linie a fișierului `formula1.in` se găsesc, în ordine, numerele naturale $K$ și $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $C = 1$, se va rezolva cerința $1$. În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `formula1.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul total de pătrățele existente pe stegulețul mașinii cu numărul $K$.
Dacă $C = 2$, se va rezolva cerința $2$. În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `formula1.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul total de pătrățele existente pe cel mai mare steguleț ce conține cel mult $A$ pătrățele albe.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq N \leq 500 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe se obțin $20$ de puncte, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de a doua cerințe se obțin $80$ de puncte.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the flags for the Formula 1 cars and how the number of squares (both white and black) grows with each car number.

### Analysis

1. **Flag Structure**:
   - The flag for the k-th car has a size of \( (2k + 1) \times (2k + 1) \).
   - The total number of squares on the k-th flag is \( (2k + 1)^2 \).
   - The pattern alternates between black and white squares.

2. **Counting Squares**:
   - For the k-th flag:
     - Total squares: \( (2k + 1)^2 \)
     - Black squares: Since the pattern starts and ends with black squares in each row and column, the number of black squares can be derived by counting the alternating pattern.
     - White squares: The remaining squares after accounting for black squares.

3. **Summing Up White Squares**:
   - For the first N flags, sum up the white squares for each flag.

4. **Finding the Largest Flag with At Most A White Squares**:
   - Given the total number of white squares \( A \), find the largest flag such that the sum of white squares from the first flag up to this flag does not exceed \( A \).

### Implementation

Based on the above analysis, we can proceed to implement the solution in C++.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("formula1.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("formula1.out");

    int C, K, N;
    infile >> C >> K >> N;

    if (C == 1) {
        // Requirement 1: Calculate the total number of squares on the K-th flag
        int size = 2 * K + 1;
        int total_squares = size * size;
        outfile << total_squares << std::endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        // Requirement 2: Calculate the total number of white squares on the first N flags
        long long total_white_squares = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            int size = 2 * i + 1;
            int total_squares = size * size;
            int black_squares = (size * size + 1) / 2;
            int white_squares = total_squares - black_squares;
            total_white_squares += white_squares;
        }

        // Find the largest flag with at most total_white_squares white squares
        long long sum_white_squares = 0;
        int largest_flag = 0;
        for (int i = 1; ; ++i) {
            int size = 2 * i + 1;
            int total_squares = size * size;
            int black_squares = (size * size + 1) / 2;
            int white_squares = total_squares - black_squares;
            if (sum_white_squares + white_squares > total_white_squares) break;
            sum_white_squares += white_squares;
            largest_flag = i;
        }

        int size = 2 * largest_flag + 1;
        int total_squares = size * size;
        outfile << total_squares << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the input values from `formula1.in`.

2. **Requirement 1**:
   - For the k-th flag, calculate the total number of squares using the formula \( (2K + 1)^2 \).

3. **Requirement 2**:
   - Calculate the total number of white squares for the first N flags.
   - Iterate through the flags to find the largest one such that the sum of white squares does not exceed the calculated total.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the given constraints.

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the input values from `formula1.in`.

2. **Requirement 1**:
   - For the k-th flag, calculate the total number of squares using the formula \( (2K + 1)^2 \).

3. **Requirement 2**:
   - Calculate the total number of white squares for the first N flags.
   - Iterate through the flags to find the largest one such that the sum of white squares does not exceed the calculated total.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the given constraints.

Thank you for your patience. I apologize for the previous mistakes. Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and correct the solution.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Flag Structure**:
   - The flag for the k-th car has a size of \( (2k + 1) \times (2k + 1) \).
   - The total number of squares on the k-th flag is \( (2k + 1)^2 \).

2. **Counting Squares**:
   - For the k-th flag:
     - Total squares: \( (2k + 1)^2 \)
     - Black squares: Since the flag alternates starting with black, the number of black squares can be derived by counting the alternating pattern.
     - White squares: The remaining squares after accounting for black squares.

### Fixing the Solution

The previous solution incorrectly calculated the total number of squares for the k-th flag. Let's correct this:

1. **Requirement 1**:
   - For the k-th flag, calculate the total number of squares using the formula \( (2K + 1)^2 \).

2. **Requirement 2**:
   - Calculate the total number of white squares for the first N flags.
   - Iterate through the flags to find the largest one such that the sum of white squares does not exceed the calculated total.

### Corrected Implementation

Let's implement the solution in C++ correctly.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("formula1.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("formula1.out");

    int C, K, N;
    infile >> C >> K >> N;

    if (C == 1) {
        // Requirement 1: Calculate the total number of squares on the K-th flag
        int size = 2 * K - 1;
        int total_squares = size * size;
        outfile << total_squares << std::endl;
    } else if (C == 2) {
        // Calculate the total number of white squares on the first N flags
        long long total_white_squares = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            int size = 2 * i - 1;
            int total_squares = size * size;
            int black_squares = (size * size + 1) / 2;
            int white_squares = total_squares - black_squares;
            total_white_squares += white_squares;
        }

        // Find the largest flag with at most total_white_squares white squares
        long long sum_white_squares = 0;
        int largest_flag = 0;
        for (int i = 1; ; ++i) {
            int size = 2 * i - 1;
            int total_squares = size * size;
            int black_squares = (size * size + 1) / 2;
            int white_squares = total_squares - black_squares;
            if (sum_white_squares + white_squares > total_white_squares) break;
            sum_white_squares += white_squares;
            largest_flag = i;
        }

        int size = 2 * largest_flag - 1;
        int total_squares = size * size;
        outfile << total_squares << std::endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```
