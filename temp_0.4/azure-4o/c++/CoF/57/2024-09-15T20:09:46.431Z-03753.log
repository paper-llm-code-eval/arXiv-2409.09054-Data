Autorităţile dintr-o zonă de munte intenţionează să stabilească un plan de urgenţă, pentru a reacţiona mai eficient la frecventele calamităţi naturale din zonă. În acest scop au identificat $N$ puncte de interes strategic şi le-au numerotat distinct de la $1$ la $N$. Punctele de interes strategic sunt conectate prin $M$ căi de acces având priorităţi în funcţie de importanţă. Între oricare două puncte de interes strategic există cel mult o cale de acces ce poate fi parcursă în ambele sensuri şi cel puţin un drum (format din una sau mai multe căi de acces) ce le conectează. 

În cazul unei calamităţi unele căi de acces pot fi temporar întrerupte şi astfel între anumite puncte de interes nu mai există legătură. Ca urmare pot rezulta mai multe grupuri de puncte în aşa fel încât între oricare două puncte din acelaşi grup să existe măcar un drum şi între oricare două puncte din grupuri diferite să nu existe drum. 

Autorităţile estimează gravitatea unei calamităţi ca fiind suma priorităţilor căilor de acces distruse de aceasta şi doresc să determine un scenariu de gravitate maximă, în care punctele de interes strategic să fie împărţite într-un număr de $K$ grupuri.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `urgenta.in` are următorul format:
$N\ M\ K$
$i_1 \; j_1 \; p_1 $ – între punctele $i_1$ şi $j_1$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_1$
$i_2 \; j_2 \; p_2 $ – între punctele $i_2$ şi $j_2$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_2$
...
$i_M \; j_M \; p_M $ – între punctele $i_M$ şi $j_M$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_M$

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `urgenta.out` va avea următorul format:
$\text{gravmax}$ – gravitatea maximă
$C$	– numărul de căi de acces întrerupte de calamitate
$k_1 \; h_1$ – între punctele $k_1$ şi $h_1$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
$k_2 \; h_2$ – între punctele $k_2$ şi $h_2$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
...
$k_C \; h_C$ – între punctele $k_C$ şi $h_C$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 \leq N \leq 255$
* $N - 1 \leq M \leq 32 \ 384$
* $1 \leq K \leq N$
* Priorităţile căilor de acces sunt întregi strict pozitivi mai mici decât $256$.
* Un grup de puncte poate conţine între $1$ şi $N$ puncte inclusiv.
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul va determina una singură.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible sum of priorities of the access roads that can be destroyed to split the strategic points into exactly `K` groups. This is a classic problem that can be tackled using graph theory, specifically with the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and then removing the most important edges to form the required number of groups.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Read Input**: Read the number of nodes (N), edges (M), and groups (K) from the input file.
2. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Use Kruskal’s algorithm to find the MST of the graph. This will help in identifying the minimum set of edges that connect all nodes.
3. **Remove Edges**: To form `K` groups, we need to remove `K-1` edges with the highest weights from the MST.
4. **Calculate Result**: The sum of the weights of the removed edges will be the maximum possible gravity of the calamity.

### Implementation in C++:
Here is the C++ code to implement the above logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(const Edge& other) const {
        return weight > other.weight; // Sort in descending order
    }
};

int find(vector<int>& parent, int x) {
    if (parent[x] != x) {
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x]);
    }
    return parent[x];
}

void unite(vector<int>& parent, vector<int>& rank, int x, int y) {
    int rootX = find(parent, x);
    int rootY = find(parent, y);
    if (rootX != rootY) {
        if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
            parent[rootY] = rootX;
        } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        } else {
            parent[rootY] = rootX;
            rank[rootX]++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream infile("urgenta.in");
    ofstream outfile("urgenta.out");

    int N, M, K;
    infile >> N >> M >> K;

    vector<Edge> edges(M);
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        infile >> edges[i].u >> edges[i].v >> edges[i].weight;
    }

    // Sort edges by weight in descending order
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

    // Kruskal's algorithm to find MST
    vector<int> parent(N + 1), rank(N + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        parent[i] = i;
    }

    vector<Edge> mstEdges;
    int mstWeight = 0;

    for (const Edge& edge : edges) {
        if (find(parent, edge.u) != find(parent, edge.v)) {
            unite(parent, rank, edge.u, edge.v);
            mstEdges.push_back(edge);
            mstWeight += edge.weight;
        }
    }

    // Remove K-1 most important edges
    sort(mstEdges.begin(), mstEdges.end(), [](const Edge& a, const Edge& b) {
        return a.weight > b.weight;
    });

    int gravmax = 0;
    vector<Edge> removedEdges;
    for (int i = 0; i < K - 1; ++i) {
        gravmax += mstEdges[i].weight;
        removedEdges.push_back(mstEdges[i]);
    }

    // Output the result
    outfile << gravmax << endl;
    outfile << removedEdges.size() << endl;
    for (const Edge& edge : removedEdges) {
        outfile << edge.u << " " << edge.v << endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `urgenta.in` into the `edges` vector.
2. **Sorting Edges**: The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.
3. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: We use Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST, storing the edges in `mstEdges`.
4. **Removing Edges**: To form `K` groups, we remove the `K-1` most important edges from the MST.
5. **Output**: The results are written to `urgenta.out`.

This approach ensures that we find the maximum possible gravity of the calamity by removing the most important edges from the MST.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output suggests that the initial approach of using Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and then removing edges to form the required number of groups might not be the most appropriate strategy for this problem. 

The main issue is that the problem requires us to maximize the sum of the priorities of the destroyed access roads, whereas the MST approach focuses on minimizing the total weight of the edges. Therefore, we need to rethink our approach to directly address the problem's requirements.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Read Input**: Read the number of nodes (N), edges (M), and groups (K) from the input file.
2. **Sort Edges**: Sort the edges in descending order based on their weights.
3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use the Union-Find data structure to manage the connected components.
4. **Select Edges to Remove**: Iterate through the sorted edges and select the highest priority edges to remove until we have exactly `K` groups.
5. **Calculate Result**: The sum of the weights of the removed edges will be the maximum possible gravity of the calamity.

The previous solutions did not correctly address the problem requirements. The main issue lies in how we determine which edges to remove to maximize the sum of the destroyed edges' priorities while ensuring exactly `K` groups. The approach of building a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and removing edges does not directly solve the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. **Sort Edges**: Sort the edges in descending order based on their weights.
2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use the Union-Find data structure to manage the connected components.
3. **Select Edges to Remove**: Iterate through the sorted edges and select the highest priority edges to remove until we have exactly `K` groups.
4. **Calculate Result**: The sum of the weights of the removed edges will be the maximum possible gravity of the calamity.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Read Input**: Read the number of nodes (N), edges (M), and groups (K) from the input file.
2. **Sort Edges**: Sort the edges in descending order based on their weights.
3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use the Union-Find data structure to manage the connected components.
4. **Select Edges to Remove**: Iterate through the sorted edges and select the highest priority edges to remove until we have exactly `K` groups.
5. **Calculate Result**: The sum of the weights of the removed edges will be the maximum possible gravity of the calamity.

### Implementation in C++:
Here is the C++ code to implement the revised logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(const Edge& other) const {
        return weight > other.weight; // Sort in descending order
    }
};

int find(vector<int>& parent, int x) {
    if (parent[x] != x) {
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x]);
    }
    return parent[x];
}

void unite(vector<int>& parent, vector<int>& rank, int x, int y) {
    int rootX = find(parent, x);
    int rootY = find(parent, y);
    if (rootX != rootY) {
        if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
            parent[rootY] = rootX;
        } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        } else {
            parent[rootY] = rootX;
            rank[rootX]++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream infile("urgenta.in");
    ofstream outfile("urgenta.out");

    int N, M, K;
    infile >> N >> M >> K;

    vector<Edge> edges(M);
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        infile >> edges[i].u >> edges[i].v >> edges[i].weight;
    }

    // Sort edges by weight in descending order
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

    // Union-Find data structure to manage connected components
    vector<int> parent(N + 1), rank(N + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        parent[i] = i;
    }

    int groups = N;
    int gravmax = 0;
    vector<Edge> removedEdges;

    for (const Edge& edge : edges) {
        if (groups == K) break;
        int rootU = find(parent, edge.u);
        int rootV = find(parent, edge.v);
        if (rootU != rootV) {
            unite(parent, rank, rootU, rootV);
            removedEdges.push_back(edge);
            gravmax += edge.weight;
            groups--;
        }
    }

    // Output the result
    outfile << gravmax << endl;
    outfile << removedEdges.size() << endl;
    for (const Edge& edge : removedEdges) {
        outfile << edge.u << " " << edge.v << endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `urgenta.in` into the `edges` vector.
2. **Sorting Edges**: The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.
3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We use the Union-Find data structure to manage the connected components.
4. **Select Edges to Remove**: We iterate through the sorted edges and select the highest priority edges to remove until we have exactly `K` groups.
5. **Output**: The results are written to `urgenta.out`.

This approach ensures that we maximize the sum of the priorities of the destroyed access roads by directly focusing on removing the highest priority edges until we achieve the required number of groups.
