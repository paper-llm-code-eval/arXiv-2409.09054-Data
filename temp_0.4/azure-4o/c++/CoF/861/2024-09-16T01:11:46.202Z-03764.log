Ca în mai toate poveștile, Făt-Frumos a căutat o Cosânzeană și a găsit-o, dar tatăl ei i-a cerut să-i paveze drumul de lungime $N$ care leagă castelele sale. Dalele cu care va pava drumul au aceeași lățime (egală cu lățimea drumului) și lungimi numere naturale. Fiind un împărat cam sâcâit, acesta dorește ca pavarea să se facă folosind un număr minim de dale, diferența de lungime între două dale vecine să nu fie mai mare ca $1$, iar prima și ultima dală să fie de lungime $1$. Împăratul nu se mulțumește să primească de la Făt-Frumos doar un număr (numărul minim de dale necesare): el vrea și posibilitatea de pavare cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Compararea lexicografică a două șiruri de numere este o extensie la numere a comparării alfabetice a două cuvinte. Astfel, fiind date două șiruri numerice de aceeași lungime, $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m$ și $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m$, acestea sunt egale dacă și numai dacă $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $m$. Șirul $A$ este mai mic lexicografic decât șirul $B$ dacă există o valoare $k$ astfel încât $A_k < B_k$ și $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $k - 1$. De exemplu, șirul $3, 5, 4, 1$ este mai mare lexicografic decât șirul $3, 5, 2, 9$ pentru că prima poziție pe care valorile diferă este poziția $3$ ($4 > 2$), fără a mai conta valorile aflate după aceasta.

# Cerință

Cunoscând lungimea drumului, determinați numărul minim de dale necesare pavării și posibilitatea de pavare cu număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Date de intrare

Prima linie a fișierului `pavare.in` conține un număr natural $V$. Linia a doua conține un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă lungimea drumului.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $1$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, doar numărul minim de dale necesare pavării.

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $2$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, un șir de numere separate prin câte un spațiu, ce reprezintă soluția de pavare a drumului, folosind un număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Restricții și precizări

* $V \in \{1,2\}$
* $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$;
* Pentru $30$% din punctaj $V = 1$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider both the constraints and the requirements:

1. **Constraints and Requirements**:
   - The length of the road \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^9 \).
   - We need to use the minimum number of tiles.
   - The difference between the lengths of two consecutive tiles should not be greater than 1.
   - The first and last tiles must have a length of 1.
   - We need to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of tiles if requested.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Given the constraints, we can infer that the optimal way to minimize the number of tiles while satisfying the conditions is to use the smallest possible lengths that sum up to \( N \).
   - We can start with the smallest lengths and incrementally increase them while ensuring the difference between consecutive tiles is at most 1.

3. **Steps to Solve**:
   - First, calculate the minimum number of tiles required.
   - If \( V = 1 \), output just the number of tiles.
   - If \( V = 2 \), construct and output the lexicographically smallest sequence of tile lengths.

### Solution

Here's the C++ code that implements the above logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pavare.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pavare.out");

    int V;
    long long N;
    infile >> V >> N;

    // Determine the minimum number of tiles required
    long long sum = 0;
    int tiles = 0;
    while (sum < N) {
        tiles++;
        sum += tiles;
    }
    if (sum > N) {
        sum -= tiles;
        tiles--;
    }

    if (V == 1) {
        outfile << tiles << "\n";
    } else {
        std::vector<int> lengths(tiles, 1);
        long long remaining = N - tiles;

        for (int i = tiles - 1; i >= 0 && remaining > 0; --i) {
            int add = std::min(remaining, (long long)i);
            lengths[i] += add;
            remaining -= add;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < tiles; ++i) {
            if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
            outfile << lengths[i];
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of \( V \) and \( N \) from the input file.
2. **Calculating Minimum Tiles**:
   - It calculates the minimum number of tiles required by summing up natural numbers until the sum is at least \( N \).
   - If the sum exceeds \( N \), it adjusts by reducing the number of tiles.
3. **Output for \( V = 1 \)**: If \( V \) is 1, it outputs the number of tiles.
4. **Constructing the Sequence for \( V = 2 \)**:
   - It initializes a vector of tile lengths with all elements set to 1.
   - It then distributes the remaining length among the tiles to ensure the difference between consecutive tiles is at most 1.
   - Finally, it outputs the sequence of tile lengths.

This approach ensures both optimality in terms of the number of tiles and lexicographical order when required.

Let's analyze the issue with the initial solution and then provide a corrected implementation.

### Analysis

The initial solution incorrectly calculates the minimum number of tiles needed to pave the road. The correct approach should ensure that the first and last tiles are of length 1 and that the difference between consecutive tiles is at most 1.

### Correct Approach

1. **Minimum Number of Tiles**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of tiles such that the sum of their lengths equals \( N \).
   - The sequence should start and end with 1, and the difference between consecutive tiles should be at most 1.

2. **Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**:
   - The sequence should be constructed in such a way that it is the smallest in lexicographical order.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Tiles**:
   - Start with the smallest possible sequence that meets the requirements.
   - Adjust the lengths to ensure the sum equals \( N \).

2. **Output**:
   - If \( V = 1 \), output the number of tiles.
   - If \( V = 2 \), output the sequence of tile lengths.

### Corrected Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pavare.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pavare.out");

    int V;
    long long N;
    infile >> V >> N;

    // Calculate the minimum number of tiles
    long long sum = 0;
    int tiles = 0;
    while (sum + tiles + 1 <= N) {
        tiles++;
        sum += tiles;
    }

    // Adjust the sum to exactly match N
    std::vector<int> lengths(tiles);
    for (int i = 0; i < tiles; ++i) {
        lengths[i] = i + 1;
    }

    long long remaining = N - sum;
    for (int i = tiles - 1; i >= 0 && remaining > 0; --i) {
        int add = std::min(remaining, (long long)tiles - 1 - i);
        lengths[i] += add;
        remaining -= add;
    }

    if (V == 1) {
        outfile << tiles << "\n";
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < tiles; ++i) {
            if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
            outfile << lengths[i];
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of \( V \) and \( N \) from the input file.
2. **Calculating Minimum Tiles**:
   - It calculates the minimum number of tiles required by summing up the smallest possible sequence until the sum is at least \( N \).
   - It then adjusts the lengths to ensure the sum exactly matches \( N \) while maintaining the constraints.
3. **Output for \( V = 1 \)**: If \( V \) is 1, it outputs the number of tiles.
4. **Constructing the Sequence for \( V = 2 \)**:
   - It initializes a vector of tile lengths with the smallest possible sequence.
   - It then distributes the remaining length among the tiles to ensure the sum equals \( N \).
   - Finally, it outputs the sequence of tile lengths.

The previous solutions failed to correctly compute the number of tiles needed to pave the road while ensuring the constraints are met. Let's re-evaluate the problem and come up with a correct approach.

### Problem Analysis

Given the constraints:
1. The first and last tiles must be of length 1.
2. The difference between consecutive tiles must be at most 1.
3. We need to minimize the number of tiles.
4. If \( V = 2 \), we need to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly:
1. We need to calculate the minimum number of tiles.
2. Construct the sequence of tiles such that the sum equals \( N \) and the sequence is lexicographically smallest.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Tiles**:
   - Start with the smallest possible sequence that meets the requirements.
   - Adjust the lengths to ensure the sum equals \( N \).

2. **Output**:
   - If \( V = 1 \), output the number of tiles.
   - If \( V = 2 \), output the sequence of tile lengths.

### Corrected Implementation

Let's reimplement the solution with a correct approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pavare.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pavare.out");

    int V;
    long long N;
    infile >> V >> N;

    // Calculate the minimum number of tiles
    long long sum = 0;
    int tiles = 0;
    while (sum + (tiles + 1) <= N) {
        tiles++;
        sum += tiles;
    }

    // Calculate the remaining length to be distributed
    long long remaining = N - sum;

    // Initialize the lengths of the tiles
    std::vector<int> lengths(tiles, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < tiles - 1; ++i) {
        lengths[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Distribute the remaining length to ensure the sum equals N
    for (int i = tiles - 2; i >= 0 && remaining > 0; --i) {
        int add = std::min(remaining, (long long)tiles - 1 - i);
        lengths[i] += add;
        remaining -= add;
    }

    if (V == 1) {
        outfile << tiles << "\n";
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < tiles; ++i) {
            if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
            outfile << lengths[i];
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of \( V \) and \( N \) from the input file.
2. **Calculating Minimum Tiles**:
   - It calculates the minimum number of tiles required by summing up the smallest possible sequence until the sum is at least \( N \).
   - If the sum exceeds \( N \), it adjusts by reducing the number of tiles.
3. **Output for \( V = 1 \)**: If \( V \) is 1, it outputs the number of tiles.
4. **Constructing the Sequence for \( V = 2 \)**:
   - It initializes a vector of tile lengths with the smallest possible sequence.
   - It then distributes the remaining length among the tiles to ensure the sum equals \( N \).
   - Finally, it outputs the sequence of tile lengths.

This approach ensures both optimality in terms of the number of tiles and lexicographical order when required.
