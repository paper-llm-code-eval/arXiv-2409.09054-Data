Ca în mai toate poveștile, Făt-Frumos a căutat o Cosânzeană și a găsit-o, dar tatăl ei i-a cerut să-i paveze drumul de lungime $N$ care leagă castelele sale. Dalele cu care va pava drumul au aceeași lățime (egală cu lățimea drumului) și lungimi numere naturale. Fiind un împărat cam sâcâit, acesta dorește ca pavarea să se facă folosind un număr minim de dale, diferența de lungime între două dale vecine să nu fie mai mare ca $1$, iar prima și ultima dală să fie de lungime $1$. Împăratul nu se mulțumește să primească de la Făt-Frumos doar un număr (numărul minim de dale necesare): el vrea și posibilitatea de pavare cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Compararea lexicografică a două șiruri de numere este o extensie la numere a comparării alfabetice a două cuvinte. Astfel, fiind date două șiruri numerice de aceeași lungime, $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m$ și $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m$, acestea sunt egale dacă și numai dacă $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $m$. Șirul $A$ este mai mic lexicografic decât șirul $B$ dacă există o valoare $k$ astfel încât $A_k < B_k$ și $A_i = B_i$ pentru orice $i$ de la $1$ la $k - 1$. De exemplu, șirul $3, 5, 4, 1$ este mai mare lexicografic decât șirul $3, 5, 2, 9$ pentru că prima poziție pe care valorile diferă este poziția $3$ ($4 > 2$), fără a mai conta valorile aflate după aceasta.

# Cerință

Cunoscând lungimea drumului, determinați numărul minim de dale necesare pavării și posibilitatea de pavare cu număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Date de intrare

Prima linie a fișierului `pavare.in` conține un număr natural $V$. Linia a doua conține un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă lungimea drumului.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $1$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, doar numărul minim de dale necesare pavării.

Dacă $V$ va avea valoarea $2$, în fișierul `pavare.out` se va scrie, pe prima linie, un șir de numere separate prin câte un spațiu, ce reprezintă soluția de pavare a drumului, folosind un număr minim de dale, care este cea mai mică din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Restricții și precizări

* $V \in \{1,2\}$
* $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$;
* Pentru $30$% din punctaj $V = 1$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider two main tasks:
1. Compute the minimum number of tiles required to pave the road.
2. Generate the lexicographically smallest sequence of tile lengths that meets the criteria.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to pave a road of length `N` using tiles where the first and last tile must be of length `1`.
   - The difference in length between any two consecutive tiles must be at most `1`.
   - We need to either find the number of tiles or the lexicographically smallest sequence of tile lengths.

2. **Minimum Number of Tiles**:
   - The minimum number of tiles can be determined by considering the sequence of lengths starting and ending with `1` and incrementing or decrementing by at most `1` in between.
   - For example, for `N = 7`, the sequence could be `1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1` which has 5 tiles.

3. **Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**:
   - The smallest sequence lexicographically is obtained by using the smallest possible values for the tile lengths while maintaining the constraints.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the input values from `pavare.in`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Number of Tiles**:
   - Use a greedy approach to determine the minimum number of tiles required.

3. **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**:
   - Construct the sequence by starting with `1`, incrementing up to the midpoint, and then decrementing back to `1`.

4. **Writing Output**:
   - Write the result to `pavare.out`.

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pavare.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pavare.out");

    int V;
    long long N;
    infile >> V >> N;

    if (V == 1) {
        // Calculate the minimum number of tiles
        long long min_tiles = 1 + (N - 1) / 2;
        outfile << min_tiles << "\n";
    } else if (V == 2) {
        // Generate the lexicographically smallest sequence
        std::vector<int> sequence;
        long long remaining_length = N;
        int current_length = 1;
        
        while (remaining_length > 0) {
            sequence.push_back(current_length);
            remaining_length -= current_length;
            if (remaining_length <= 0) break;
            if (current_length == 1) {
                current_length = 2;
            } else {
                current_length = 1;
            }
        }

        for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
            if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
            outfile << sequence[i];
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read the values of `V` and `N` from the input file.

2. **Calculating Minimum Number of Tiles**:
   - For `V == 1`, we calculate the minimum number of tiles using the formula `1 + (N - 1) / 2`.

3. **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**:
   - For `V == 2`, we construct the sequence by alternating between `1` and `2` until the remaining length is covered.

4. **Writing Output**:
   - We write the result to the output file in the required format.

This solution ensures efficient computation and meets the constraints provided in the problem statement.

Let's analyze the discrepancy between the expected and found results. The expected output for the input `1 7` is `5`, but the program produced `4`.

### Issue Analysis

The issue lies in the calculation of the minimum number of tiles. The formula `1 + (N - 1) / 2` is not correct for determining the minimum number of tiles required to pave the road. Instead, we need to consider the sequence of tiles that starts and ends with `1` and increments/decrements by at most `1`.

### Correct Approach

To find the minimum number of tiles:
1. The sequence should start and end with `1`.
2. The tiles in between should be such that the difference between consecutive tiles is at most `1`.

For `N = 7`, the correct sequence is `1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`, which has 5 tiles.

### Correct Formula

The correct formula to calculate the minimum number of tiles is:
- If `N` is odd, the minimum number of tiles is `(N + 1) / 2`.
- If `N` is even, the minimum number of tiles is `N / 2 + 1`.

### Correct Implementation

Here is the corrected C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pavare.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pavare.out");

    int V;
    long long N;
    infile >> V >> N;

    if (V == 1) {
        // Calculate the minimum number of tiles
        long long min_tiles = (N + 1) / 2;
        outfile << min_tiles << "\n";
    } else if (V == 2) {
        // Generate the lexicographically smallest sequence
        std::vector<int> sequence;
        long long remaining_length = N;
        int current_length = 1;
        
        while (remaining_length > 0) {
            sequence.push_back(current_length);
            remaining_length -= current_length;
            if (remaining_length <= 0) break;
            if (current_length == 1) {
                current_length = 2;
            } else {
                current_length = 1;
            }
        }

        for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
            if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
            outfile << sequence[i];
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix

1. **Minimum Number of Tiles Calculation**:
   - For `V == 1`, the correct formula to calculate the minimum number of tiles is `(N + 1) / 2` for both odd and even `N`.

2. **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**:
   - The sequence generation logic remains the same as it correctly alternates between `1` and `2` to maintain the smallest lexicographical order.

This corrected implementation should now produce the expected results for the given input.

1. **Minimum Number of Tiles**:
   - The sequence must start and end with `1`.

- If `N` is odd, the minimum number of tiles is `(N + 1) / 2`.

            remaining_length -= current_length;
            if (remaining_length <= 0) break;
            if (current_length == 1 && remaining_length > 1) {
                current_length = 2;
            } else {
                current_length = 1;
            }

- If `N` is odd, the minimum number of tiles is `(N + 1) / 2`.
- If `N` is even, the minimum number of tiles is `N / 2 + 1`.

### Correct Implementation

Here is the corrected C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pavare.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pavare.out");

    int V;
    long long N;
    infile >> V >> N;

    if (V == 1) {
        // Calculate the minimum number of tiles
        long long min_tiles = (N + 1) / 2;
        outfile << min_tiles << "\n";
    } else if (V == 2) {
        // Generate the lexicographically smallest sequence
        std::vector<int> sequence;
        long long remaining_length = N;
        int current_length = 1;

        sequence.push_back(1);
        remaining_length -= 1;

        while (remaining_length > 1) {
            if (remaining_length - (current_length + 1) >= 1) {
                current_length++;
                sequence.push_back(current_length);
                remaining_length -= current_length;
            } else {
                sequence.push_back(remaining_length);
                remaining_length = 0;
            }
        }

        if (remaining_length == 1) {
            sequence.push_back(1);
        }

        for (size_t i = 0; i < sequence.size(); ++i) {
            if (i > 0) outfile << " ";
            outfile << sequence[i];
        }
        outfile << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Fix

1. **Minimum Number of Tiles Calculation**:
   - For `V == 1`, the correct formula to calculate the minimum number of tiles is `(N + 1) / 2`.

2. **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence**:
   - The sequence generation logic has been adjusted to ensure that the sequence alternates between `1` and `2` correctly to maintain the smallest lexicographical order while ensuring the sequence starts and ends with `1`.

This corrected implementation should now produce the expected results for the given input.
