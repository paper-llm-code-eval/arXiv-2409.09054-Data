Corneluș a învățat să numere. El pornește întotdeauna de la $1$, numără din $1$ în $1$, nu greșește niciodată numărul următor, însă ezită uneori și atunci spune numărul curent de mai multe ori. Sora lui, Corina, îl urmărește și face tot felul de calcule asupra modurilor în care numără fratele ei. Astfel, ea urmărește până la cât numără $(U)$, câte numere spune în total $(N)$ și, pentru a aprecia cât de ezitant este, numărul maxim de repetări $(R)$ ale unei valori. De exemplu, el poate număra până la $8$ astfel: $1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 7 \ 7 \ 7 \ 8 \ 8$. În acest caz, numără până la $8 \ (U=8)$, spune $13$ numere $(N=13)$ și ezită cel mai mult la $7$, spunându-l de $4$ ori $(R=4)$.

# Cerințe

1) Cunoscând numărul total de numere $N$ și ultimul număr spus $U$, trebuie să calculați câte șiruri diferite au exact $N$ numere și se termină cu numărul $U$.
2) Cunoscând numărul total de numere $N$ și numărul maxim de repetări $R$ ale unei valori, trebuie să calculați câte șiruri diferite au exact $N$ numere și fiecare valoare se repetă de cel mult $R$ ori. 

Deoarece numărul de șiruri poate fi foarte mare, calculați restul împărțirii acestui număr la $20 \ 173 \ 333$.

# Date de intrare


Din fișierul `sir.in` se citesc trei numere naturale, $P, N$ și $X$, scrise în această ordine, cu câte un spațiu între ele. $P$ poate avea una dintre valorile  $1$ sau $2$, iar $N$ este numărul de numere din șir. Când $P$ are valoarea $1$, numărul $X$ reprezintă ultimul număr spus $(U)$, iar când $P$ are valoarea $2$, $X$ reprezintă numărul maxim de repetări ale unei valori $(R)$.

# Date de ieșire


În fișierul `sir.out` se scrie o singură valoare, astfel: 

* dacă $P$ a avut valoarea $1$, valoarea reprezintă numărul de șiruri distincte care au exact $N$ numere și se termină cu numărul $X$
* dacă $P$ a avut valoarea $2$, valoarea reprezintă numărul de șiruri distincte care au exact $N$ numere și fiecare număr se repetă de cel mult $X$ ori.

**În ambele cazuri**, deoarece numărul rezultat poate fi foarte mare, se va scrie restul împărțirii acestui număr la $20 \ 173 \ 333$. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$
* $ X \leq N$
* Ultima valoare spusă poate să apară de mai multe ori;
* Testele cu $P=1$ vor totaliza $50\%$ din punctaj, restul de $50\%$ din punctaj fiind pentru $P=2$;
* Pentru teste cumulând 50 de puncte valoarea lui $N$ nu depășește $1\ 000$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the problem, we need to handle two cases based on the value of `P`:

1. **When `P = 1`**: We need to find the number of distinct sequences of length `N` that end with the number `U`.
2. **When `P = 2`**: We need to find the number of distinct sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times.

Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to calculate these sequences. Dynamic programming (DP) is a suitable method for this problem due to its ability to break down problems into simpler subproblems and store the results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Case 1: `P = 1`
For this case, we need to count the number of sequences of length `N` that end with `U`. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence and `j` represents the last number in the sequence. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j`.

### Case 2: `P = 2`
For this case, we need to count the number of sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence and `j` represents the maximum number of times any number can be repeated in the sequence.

### Implementation
Let's implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 20173333;

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("sir.in");
    std::ofstream fout("sir.out");

    int P, N, X;
    fin >> P >> N >> X;

    if (P == 1) {
        int U = X;
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(N + 1, std::vector<int>(U + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= U; ++j) {
                for (int k = 0; k < j; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        fout << dp[N][U] << "\n";
    } 
    else if (P == 2) {
        int R = X;
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(N + 1, std::vector<int>(R + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= R; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] * j) % MOD;
            }
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= R; ++j) {
            result = (result + dp[N][j]) % MOD;
        }

        fout << result << "\n";
    }

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: We read the input values `P`, `N`, and `X` from `sir.in`.
2. **Case 1 (`P = 1`)**:
   - We use a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` ending with `j`.
   - We initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there's one way to have a sequence of length 0.
   - We iterate through the lengths and possible last numbers, updating the DP table based on previous values.
3. **Case 2 (`P = 2`)**:
   - We use a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` with the maximum repetition of any number being `j`.
   - We initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there's one way to have a sequence of length 0.
   - We iterate through the lengths and possible maximum repetitions, updating the DP table based on previous values.
4. **Output**: We write the result to `sir.out`.

This solution ensures efficient computation using dynamic programming, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy. Upon reviewing the initial implementation, I realized that the approach for handling the dynamic programming (DP) transitions was incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and come up with a correct solution.

### Case 1: `P = 1`
For this case, we need to count the number of sequences of length `N` that end with `U`. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence and `j` represents the last number in the sequence. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j`.

### Case 2: `P = 2`
For this case, we need to count the number of sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence and `j` represents the last number in the sequence. We need to ensure that no number is repeated more than `R` times.

Thank you for your patience. Let's re-evaluate the problem and fix the solution step by step. The previous implementation had logical flaws in the dynamic programming transitions. We need to ensure that the transitions correctly account for the constraints given in the problem.

### Case 1: `P = 1`
We need to count the number of sequences of length `N` that end with `U`. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence and `j` represents the last number in the sequence. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j`.

### Case 2: `P = 2`
We need to count the number of sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence, `j` represents the current number, and `k` represents the count of the current number. The value of `dp[i][j][k]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j` repeated `k` times.

### Problem Analysis

To solve the problem, we need to handle two cases based on the value of `P`:

1. **When `P = 1`**: We need to find the number of distinct sequences of length `N` that end with the number `U`.
2. **When `P = 2`**: We need to find the number of distinct sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times.

We can use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence and `j` represents the last number in the sequence. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j`.

For this case, we need to count the number of sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence, `j` represents the current number, and `k` represents the count of the current number. The value of `dp[i][j][k]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j` repeated `k` times.

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: We read the input values `P`, `N`, and `X` from `sir.in`.
2. **Case 1 (`P = 1`)**:
   - We use a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` ending with `j`.
   - We initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there's one way to have a sequence of length 0.
   - We iterate through the lengths and possible last numbers, updating the DP table based on previous values.
   - We ensure that the transitions correctly account for the constraints given in the problem.
3. **Case 2 (`P = 2`)**:
   - We use a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` with `j` distinct numbers.
   - We initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there's one way to have a sequence of length 0.
   - We iterate through the lengths and possible distinct numbers, updating the DP table based on previous values.
   - We ensure that no number is repeated more than `R` times.
4. **Output**: We write the result to `sir.out`.

This solution ensures efficient computation using dynamic programming, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Thank you for your patience. Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure we implement the correct solution. The previous attempts had logical flaws in the dynamic programming transitions and initialization.

### Problem Analysis

To solve the problem, we need to handle two cases based on the value of `P`:

1. **When `P = 1`**: We need to find the number of distinct sequences of length `N` that end with the number `U`.
2. **When `P = 2`**: We need to find the number of distinct sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times.

Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to calculate these sequences. Dynamic programming (DP) is a suitable method for this problem due to its ability to break down problems into simpler subproblems and store the results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Case 1: `P = 1`
For this case, we need to count the number of sequences of length `N` that end with `U`. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence and `j` represents the last number in the sequence. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j`.

### Case 2: `P = 2`
For this case, we need to count the number of sequences of length `N` where no number is repeated more than `R` times. We can use a DP array `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` represents the length of the sequence, `j` represents the current number, and `k` represents the count of the current number. The value of `dp[i][j][k]` will be the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j` repeated `k` times.

### Implementation
Let's implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

const int MOD = 20173333;

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("sir.in");
    std::ofstream fout("sir.out");

    int P, N, X;
    fin >> P >> N >> X;

    if (P == 1) {
        int U = X;
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(N + 1, std::vector<int>(U + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= U; ++j) {
                for (int k = 0; k < j; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        fout << dp[N][U] << "\n";
    } 
    else if (P == 2) {
        int R = X;
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(N + 1, std::vector<int>(N + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= R && k <= i; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - k][j - 1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
            result = (result + dp[N][j]) % MOD;
        }
