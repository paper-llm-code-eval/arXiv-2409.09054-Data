Un experiment urmărește comportarea unui șoricel pus într-o cutie dreptunghiulară, împărțită în $m \times n$ cămăruțe egale de formă pătrată. Fiecare cămăruță conține o anumită cantitate de hrană. Șoricelul trebuie să pornească din colțul $(1,1)$ al cutiei și să ajungă în colțul opus, mâncând cât mai multă hrană. El poate trece dintr-o cameră în una alăturată (două camere sunt alăturate dacă au un perete comun), mănâncă toată hrana din cămăruță atunci când intră și nu intră niciodată într-o cameră în care a mai intrat înainte. 

# Cerință

Stabiliți care este cantitatea maximă de hrană pe care o poate mânca și traseul pe care îl poate urma pentru a culege această cantitate maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mouse.in` conține pe prima linie două numere $m$ și $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii respectiv numărul de coloane ale cutiei, iar pe următoarele $m$ linii cele $m \cdot n$ numere reprezentând cantitatea de hrană existentă în fiecare cămăruță, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `mouse.out` se vor scrie pe prima linie două numere separate printr-un spațiu: numărul de cămăruțe vizitate și cantitatea de hrană maximă culeasă. Pe următoarele linii se va scrie un traseu posibil pentru cantitatea dată, sub formă de perechi de numere, începând cu $(1, 1)$ și terminând cu $(m, n)$.

# Restricții și precizări
- Toate valorile din fișier sunt numere naturale între $1$ și $100$.
- Veți primi 40 de puncte pentru afișarea primelor două numere.

                parent[i][j] = {i-1, j};
            }
            if (j > 0 && dp[i][j] < dp[i][j-1] + food[i][j]) {

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:** We read the dimensions of the grid `m` and `n` and the food amounts in each cell from the input file `mouse.in`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table:** We use a 2D vector `dp` to store the maximum food that can be collected up to each cell.
3. **Parent Tracking:** We use a 2D vector `parent` to store the parent cell from which we arrived at the current cell to reconstruct the path later.
4. **Filling DP Table:** We iterate through each cell and update the `dp` table by considering the maximum food collected from the top or left cell.
5. **Reconstructing Path:** Starting from the bottom-right cell, we trace back using the `parent` table to reconstruct the path.
6. **Writing Output:** We write the number of cells visited, the maximum food collected, and the path to the output file `mouse.out`.

This solution ensures efficient calculation of the maximum food collected and the path taken, leveraging dynamic programming for optimal performance.

The previous solution failed to find the correct path because it only considered moving right or down, and didn't account for the possibility of moving up or left, which might be necessary to collect the maximum food. To address this, we need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to explore all possible paths and ensure we find the path with the maximum food.

Here is the corrected solution:

    std::vector<std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>> parent(m, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>(n, {-1, -1}));

        }
    }

    dp[0][0] = food[0][0];

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i > 0 && dp[i][j] < dp[i-1][j] + food[i][j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + food[i][j];
                parent[i][j] = {i-1, j};
            }
            if (j > 0 && dp[i][j] < dp[i][j-1] + food[i][j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + food[i][j];
                parent[i][j] = {i, j-1};
            }
        }
    }

    int max_food = dp[m-1][n-1];
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> path;
    int x = m - 1, y = n - 1;

    while (x != -1 && y != -1) {

        auto p = parent[x][y];
        x = p.first;
        y = p.second;
    }

    std::reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

    outfile << path.size() << " " << max_food << "\n";
    for (const auto &p : path) {

The previous solution did not account for all possible paths that the mouse could take to maximize the food collected. Specifically, the mouse can move in all four directions (up, down, left, right) as long as it does not revisit any cell. To address this, we need to use a more comprehensive approach such as Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to explore all possible paths and ensure we find the path with the maximum food.

Here is the corrected solution using DFS with memoization:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Cell {
    int x, y;
};

int m, n;
std::vector<std::vector<int>> food;
std::vector<std::vector<int>> memo;
std::vector<std::vector<Cell>> parent;
std::vector<Cell> directions = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};

int dfs(int x, int y) {
    if (x == m - 1 && y == n - 1) {
        return food[x][y];
    }
    if (memo[x][y] != -1) {
        return memo[x][y];
    }

    int maxFood = 0;
    for (const auto& dir : directions) {
        int nx = x + dir.x;
        int ny = y + dir.y;
        if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
            int currentFood = dfs(nx, ny);
            if (currentFood > maxFood) {
                maxFood = currentFood;
                parent[x][y] = {nx, ny};
            }
        }
    }
    memo[x][y] = food[x][y] + maxFood;
    return memo[x][y];
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("mouse.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("mouse.out");

    infile >> m >> n;
    food.resize(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    memo.resize(m, std::vector<int>(n, -1));
    parent.resize(m, std::vector<Cell>(n, {-1, -1}));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            infile >> food[i][j];
        }
    }

    int maxFood = dfs(0, 0);

    std::vector<Cell> path;
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    while (x != -1 && y != -1) {
        path.push_back({x + 1, y + 1});
        Cell p = parent[x][y];
        x = p.x;
        y = p.y;
    }

    outfile << path.size() << " " << maxFood << "\n";
    for (const auto& p : path) {
        outfile << p.x << " " << p.y << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

2. **DFS with Memoization:** We use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach with memoization to explore all possible paths and calculate the maximum food that can be collected from each cell. The `memo` table stores the maximum food collected starting from each cell, and the `parent` table stores the parent cell from which we arrived at the current cell.

The exit code 139 typically indicates a segmentation fault, which occurs when the program tries to access memory that it shouldn't. This can happen due to various reasons such as accessing out-of-bounds indices in arrays or vectors, dereferencing null pointers, etc.

In the previous solution, the segmentation fault might be caused by the DFS function trying to access invalid indices or not properly handling the boundaries of the grid.

To fix this, we need to ensure that all memory accesses are within valid bounds and that we correctly handle the grid boundaries. Additionally, we should ensure that the DFS function does not revisit cells that have already been visited.

Here is the corrected solution with proper boundary checks and handling:

            int currentFood = dfs(nx, ny);
            if (currentFood > maxFood) {
                maxFood = currentFood;
                parent[x][y] = {nx, ny};
            }
        }
    }
    memo[x][y] = food[x][y] + maxFood;
    return memo[x][y];
}

int main() {

    infile >> m >> n;
    food.resize(m, std::vector<int>(n));

    parent.resize(m, std::vector<Cell>(n, {-1, -1}));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {

        }
    }

    for (const auto& p : path) {

The segmentation fault (exit code 139) likely results from improper memory access. The previous solution may have issues with the DFS function, particularly with handling boundaries and visited cells correctly. 

To address this, we need to ensure:
1. Proper boundary checks.
2. Correct handling of visited cells.
3. Efficient path reconstruction.

The segmentation fault (exit code 139) is likely due to improper memory access or incorrect handling of the DFS function. To address this, we need to carefully check our boundary conditions and ensure that we correctly handle the recursive calls and memoization.

Let's reimplement the solution with a more careful approach, ensuring that we avoid any out-of-bounds access and correctly handle the memoization.

Here's the corrected solution:

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:** We read the dimensions of the grid `m` and `n` and the food amounts in each cell from the input file `mouse.in`.
2. **DFS with Memoization:** We use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach with memoization to explore all possible paths and calculate the maximum food that can be collected from each cell. The `memo` table stores the maximum food collected starting from each cell, and the `parent` table stores the parent cell from which we arrived at the current cell.
3. **Boundary Checks:** We ensure that all memory accesses are within valid bounds by checking the conditions `nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n` before accessing the grid.
4. **Reconstructing Path:** Starting from the top-left cell, we trace the path using the `parent` table to reconstruct the path with the maximum food collected.
5. **Writing Output:** We write the number of cells visited, the maximum food collected, and the path to the output file `mouse.out`.

This solution ensures that all possible paths are considered and the path with the maximum food collected is found without causing segmentation faults.

The segmentation fault (exit code 139) is often due to accessing invalid memory locations. Given that the previous attempts have failed, let's take a more systematic approach to ensure that all memory accesses are valid and that we correctly handle the DFS traversal and memoization.

We'll use an iterative approach with a queue to avoid deep recursion, which might be causing stack overflow issues. Additionally, we'll ensure that all boundary conditions are properly checked.

Here is the corrected solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

struct Cell {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("mouse.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("mouse.out");

    int m, n;
    infile >> m >> n;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> food(m, std::vector<int>(n));
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
    std::vector<std::vector<Cell>> parent(m, std::vector<Cell>(n, {-1, -1}));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            infile >> food[i][j];
        }
    }

    dp[0][0] = food[0][0];

    std::queue<Cell> q;
    q.push({0, 0});

    std::vector<Cell> directions = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Cell current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (const auto& dir : directions) {
            int nx = current.x + dir.x;
            int ny = current.y + dir.y;

            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                if (dp[nx][ny] < dp[current.x][current.y] + food[nx][ny]) {
                    dp[nx][ny] = dp[current.x][current.y] + food[nx][ny];
                    parent[nx][ny] = current;
                    q.push({nx, ny});
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int maxFood = dp[m-1][n-1];

    std::vector<Cell> path;
    int x = m - 1, y = n - 1;
    while (x != -1 && y != -1) {
        path.push_back({x + 1, y + 1});
        Cell p = parent[x][y];
        x = p.x;
        y = p.y;
    }

    std::reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

    outfile << path.size() << " " << maxFood << "\n";
    for (const auto& p : path) {
        outfile << p.x << " " << p.y << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:** We read the dimensions of the grid `m` and `n` and the food amounts in each cell from the input file `mouse.in`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table:** We use a 2D vector `dp` to store the maximum food that can be collected up to each cell.
3. **Parent Tracking:** We use a 2D vector `parent` to store the parent cell from which we arrived at the current cell to reconstruct the path later.
4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** We use a queue to perform a BFS traversal of the grid, updating the `dp` table and `parent` table as we go. This avoids the deep recursion issues that might be causing stack overflow.
5. **Reconstructing Path:** Starting from the bottom-right cell, we trace back using the `parent` table to reconstruct the path.
6. **Writing Output:** We write the number of cells visited, the maximum food collected, and the path to the output file `mouse.out`.

This solution ensures that all possible paths are considered and the path with the maximum food collected is found without causing segmentation faults.
