Alexandra, prințesa Regatului Visurilor a primit un tort și vrea să îl împartă cu prietenii ei. Astfel ea va organiza o petrecere unde îi va invita. Tortul Alexandrei este format din $N$ bucăți, iar a $i$-a bucată are $a_i$ cireșe. Alexandra va împărți tortul în mai multe secvențe continue de bucăți, astfel încât fiecare bucată este inclusă în exact o secvență, și fiecare secvență conține cel puțin o bucată de tort. Prima secvență – cea care conține prima bucată – o va mânca în noaptea de înaintea petrecerii, iar restul bucăților le va da celorlalți prieteni invitați. Pentru a nu îi supăra, Alexandra vrea ca fiecare secvență dată unui prieten să conțină la fel de multe cireșe ca oricare altă secvență dată unui prieten (dar nu neapărat la fel de multe cireșe ca aceea mâncată de ea înaintea petrecerii). Alexandra trebuie să invite cel puțin un prieten la petrecere.


# Cerință


Dându-se $N$ și șirul $a$, să se afle numărul de moduri în care Alexandra ar putea să împartă tortul în secvențe continue, astfel încât să se respecte condițiile din enunț. Două moduri de a împărți tortul se consideră a fi distincte dacă și numai dacă există în unul o secvență care nu există în ceălalt (dacă am reprezenta un mod de împărțire în secvențe prin intermediul șirului crescător al indicilor de început pentru fiecare secvență din acea împărțire, două moduri de împărțire sunt distincte dacă șirurile de indici asociate lor sunt diferite).


Formal, dându-se un șir de numere, se vrea să aflăm numărul de moduri de a împărți șirul în cel puțin două subsecvențe, astfel încât sumele elementelor tuturor subsecvențelor să fie egale, prima putând să aibă suma elementelor diferită de a celorlalte.


# Date de intrare


Prima linie a fișierului de intrare `tort.in` conține numărul $N$. A doua linie conține valorile $a_1, \dots , a_N$, separate prin spații.


# Date de ieșire


Singura linie a fișierului de ieșire `tort.out` va conține numărul cerut.


# Restricții și precizări

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to find all possible ways to split the cake into continuous subsequences such that each subsequence (except the first one) has the same sum of cherries. Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Read Input**: We need to read the number of pieces \( N \) and the array \( a \) of cherries in each piece.
2. **Calculate Total Sum**: Compute the total sum of the array \( a \).
3. **Determine Valid Subsequence Sums**: Identify all possible sums that can be used for the subsequences given the constraints.
4. **Count Valid Splits**: For each valid sum, count the number of ways to split the array such that each subsequence (except the first one) has the same sum.

Here is the C++ code that implements this logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("tort.in");
    std::ofstream fout("tort.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> a(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    long long totalSum = std::accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0LL);

    // We will use a map to store the prefix sums and their counts
    std::unordered_map<long long, int> prefixSumCount;
    long long currentSum = 0;
    long long result = 0;

    // Iterate through the array to calculate prefix sums and count valid splits
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        currentSum += a[i];
        if (currentSum * (N - i - 1) == totalSum - currentSum) {
            result += prefixSumCount[currentSum];
        }
        prefixSumCount[currentSum]++;
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `tort.in` using `ifstream`. The number of pieces \( N \) and the array \( a \) are stored.
2. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total sum of cherries in all pieces is calculated using `std::accumulate`.
3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We use a prefix sum approach to keep track of the sum of cherries up to each piece. We store these prefix sums and their counts in a map.
4. **Counting Valid Splits**: For each piece, we check if the current prefix sum can be used to form valid subsequences. If the condition `currentSum * (N - i - 1) == totalSum - currentSum` holds, it means we can split the array at this point.

This solution ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid ways to split the cake according to the given conditions. The use of prefix sums and a map helps in keeping the complexity manageable even for large inputs.

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the initial solution to identify where it went wrong and how we can correct it.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split the cake into continuous subsequences such that:
1. The first subsequence is eaten by Alexandra.
2. The remaining subsequences, given to friends, each have the same sum of cherries.

### Key Points to Address

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We need to correctly calculate prefix sums to determine potential splits.
2. **Validation of Subsequences**: Ensure that the sum of cherries in the subsequences given to friends is consistent.

2. **Calculate Total Sum**: Compute the total sum of the array \( a \).
3. **Determine Valid Subsequence Sums**: Identify all possible sums that can be used for the subsequences given the constraints.

        }

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from `tort.in` using `ifstream`. The number of pieces \( N \) and the array \( a \) are stored.
2. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total sum of cherries in all pieces is calculated using `std::accumulate`.
3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We use a prefix sum approach to keep track of the sum of cherries up to each piece.
4. **Iterate Over Possible Splits**: We iterate over each possible starting point of the first subsequence.
5. **Check Remaining Part**: For each split, we check if the remaining part of the array can be divided into subsequences with equal sums.
6. **Validation**: We validate if the remaining part can be split into subsequences with the target sum.

This solution ensures that we correctly count the number of valid ways to split the cake according to the given conditions. The use of prefix sums and careful validation helps in keeping the complexity manageable even for large inputs.

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the previous solutions to identify where they went wrong and how we can correct them.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split the cake into continuous subsequences such that:
1. The first subsequence is eaten by Alexandra.
2. The remaining subsequences, given to friends, each have the same sum of cherries.

### Key Points to Address

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Correctly calculate prefix sums to determine potential splits.
2. **Validation of Subsequences**: Ensure that the sum of cherries in the subsequences given to friends is consistent.

### Correct Approach

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of pieces \( N \) and the array \( a \).
2. **Calculate Total Sum**: Compute the total sum of the array \( a \).
3. **Determine Valid Subsequence Sums**: Identify all possible sums that can be used for the subsequences given the constraints.
4. **Count Valid Splits**: For each valid sum, count the number of ways to split the array such that each subsequence (except the first one) has the same sum.

### Corrected Solution

Let's write a new solution that correctly implements the logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("tort.in");
    std::ofstream fout("tort.out");

    int N;
    fin >> N;
    std::vector<int> a(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        fin >> a[i];
    }

    long long totalSum = std::accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0LL);

    // We need to find the number of ways to split the array such that
    // each subsequence (except the first one) has the same sum of cherries.

    long long result = 0;

    // Calculate prefix sums
    std::vector<long long> prefixSum(N + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + a[i - 1];
    }

    // Iterate through each possible starting point of the first subsequence
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        long long sumFirstSeq = prefixSum[i];

        // Check if the remaining part can be divided into equal sum subsequences
        long long remainingSum = totalSum - sumFirstSeq;
        if (remainingSum % (N - i) != 0) {
            continue;
        }

        long long targetSum = remainingSum / (N - i);
        long long currentSum = 0;
        bool valid = true;
        for (int j = i; j < N; ++j) {
            currentSum += a[j];
            if (currentSum == targetSum) {
                currentSum = 0;
            } else if (currentSum > targetSum) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (valid && currentSum == 0) {
            result++;
        }
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
