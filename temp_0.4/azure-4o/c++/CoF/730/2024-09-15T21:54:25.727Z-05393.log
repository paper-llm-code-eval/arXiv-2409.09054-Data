Jocul “Nu te supăra, frate!” se joacă de către doi jucatori. Pe o pistă circulară cu $n$ căsuţe numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, în ordinea dată de sensul acelor de ceasornic, se află înscrise valorile $0, 1$ şi $10$. Cei doi jucători vor avea fiecare câte un pion şi vor porni pe rând, din căsuţa $1$. Începe jucătorul $1$. Fiecare jucător va muta pionul său conform cu valoarea obţinută prin aruncarea zarului, cumulând sau pierzând puncte în funcţie de căsuţa în care ajunge. Fiecare jucător citeşte valoarea zarului când îi vine rândul.

Jocul are urmatoarele reguli:
1. Câştigătorul poate fi:
	- jucătorul care ajunge primul din nou în căsuţa cu numărul $1$, indiferent de punctaj (exceptând cazul în care are punctaj $0$)
	- în cazul în care se termină şirul aruncărilor cu zarul, înseamnă că jucătorii s-au plictisit şi câştigă cel care a cumulat mai multe puncte, iar dacă au punctaje egale câştigă cel care se află în căsuţa cu număr de ordine mai mare.
2. După aruncarea zarului, jucătorul mută pionul cu atâtea căsuţe cât indică valoarea zarului, în ordinea acelor de ceasornic, începând numărătoarea cu căsuţa următoare poziţiei pe care se află. Prima căsuţă nu conţine valoarea $0$ (zero).
3. După mutare pot apare următoarele situaţii:
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $0$ (zero) – jucătorul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele acumulate şi reia jocul din pozitia $1$
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $10$ – primeşte un bonus de $10$ puncte
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă cu valoarea $1$ – primeşte $1$ punct
	- ajunge într-o căsuţă în care se află celălalt pion (cu excepţia căsuţei $1$, când câştigă) – jucătorul care ajunge ultimul este penalizat, pierde toate punctele şi reia jocul de la căsuţa $1$.

# Cerință

Determinaţi jucătorul câştigător, poziţiile fiecărui jucător pe cerc şi punctajul fiecărui jucător.

# Date de intrare

În fişierul `joc.in` se dau:
- Pe prima linie numărul $n$ al casutelor din cerc.
- Linia a doua conţine o succesiune de $n$ valori ($0, 1$ sau $10$), separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând valoarea fiecărei căsuţe.
- Linia a treia conţine numărul de aruncări cu zarul
- Linia a patra conţine o succesiune de valori întregi cuprinse între $1$ şi $6$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând aruncarea cu zarul. 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `joc.out` va conţine $3$ linii cu următoarele informaţii:
- pe prima linie: jucătorul câştigător
- pe a doua linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $1$.
- pe a treia linie: poziţia şi punctajul jucătorului numărul $2$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $7 \leq n \leq 100$;

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the `joc.in` file. The number of cells `n`, the values in each cell, the number of dice rolls `m`, and the dice roll values are read into respective variables and vectors.
2. **Initialization**: Initial positions and scores for both players are set to 0. A boolean `player1Turn` is used to keep track of whose turn it is.
3. **Game Logic**:
   - For each dice roll, the position of the current player is updated.
   - If a player lands on the other player's position, the current player is penalized.
   - If a player lands on a cell with value `0`, they are penalized.
   - If a player lands on cell `1` and they have a non-zero score, they win immediately.
   - Points are accumulated based on the cell value.
4. **Determine Winner**: After all dice rolls, the winner is determined based on the scores and positions if necessary.
5. **Output Results**: The results are written to the `joc.out` file.

This solution ensures efficient handling of the game logic and adheres to the constraints and requirements provided.

The issue with the initial solution is that it does not properly handle the case where a player lands on the same cell as the other player and the other player is penalized. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores and positions when a player lands on a cell with value `1` was not correctly implemented.

Here is the corrected solution:

    fin >> m;
    std::vector<int> diceRolls(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        fin >> diceRolls[i];
    }

    int pos1 = 0, pos2 = 0;
    int score1 = 0, score2 = 0;
    bool player1Turn = true;

        if (player1Turn) {
            pos1 = (pos1 + roll) % n;
            if (pos1 == 0 && score1 != 0) {
                fout << "1\n" << 1 << " " << score1 << "\n" << (pos2 + 1) << " " << score2 << "\n";

### Explanation of the Fixed Solution:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the `joc.in` file. The number of cells `n`, the values in each cell, the number of dice rolls `m`, and the dice roll values are read into respective variables and vectors.
2. **Initialization**: Initial positions and scores for both players are set to 0. A boolean `player1Turn` is used to keep track of whose turn it is.
3. **Game Logic**:
   - For each dice roll, the position of the current player is updated.
   - If a player lands on the other player's position, the current player is penalized.
   - If a player lands on a cell with value `0`, they are penalized.
   - If a player lands on cell `1` and they have a non-zero score, they win immediately.
   - Points are accumulated based on the cell value.
4. **Determine Winner**: After all dice rolls, the winner is determined based on the scores and positions if necessary.
5. **Output Results**: The results are written to the `joc.out` file.

This solution ensures efficient handling of the game logic and adheres to the constraints and requirements provided.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the logic for updating the score when a player lands on a cell with value `1` was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the score update for player 2 when landing on a `1` cell was not handled correctly.

Let's fix the solution by ensuring that the score updates correctly for both players when they land on a cell with value `1`.

Here is the corrected solution:

The issue with the previous solutions is that they do not correctly handle the scoring and position updates, particularly when a player lands on a cell with value `1`. Additionally, the logic for determining the winner when the game ends due to the dice rolls running out needs to be revisited.

Let's reimplement the solution with careful handling of these cases:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize positions and scores for both players.
2. **Game Loop**: Iterate through each dice roll, updating positions and scores according to the rules.
3. **Winner Determination**: After all dice rolls, determine the winner based on the scores and positions.
4. **Output Results**: Write the results to the output file.

Here is the corrected solution:

            if (pos1 == 0 && score1 != 0) {
