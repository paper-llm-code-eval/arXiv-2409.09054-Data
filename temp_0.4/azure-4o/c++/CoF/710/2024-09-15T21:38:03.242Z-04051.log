Principala misiune a unei expediții stiintifice este de a studia evoluția vieții pe o planetă nou descoperită. În urma studiilor efectuate, cercetătorii au asociat fiecărui organism viu descoperit pe acea planetă un cod caracteristic. Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

De asemenea, cercetătorii au observat că pentru orice organism viu de pe planetă, codurile caracteristice ale strămoșilor săi pe scara evoluției se pot obține prin ștergerea unor cifre din codul caracteristic al organismului respectiv, iar un organism este cu atât mai evoluat cu cât codul său caracteristic are o valoare mai mare.

# Cerință

Date fiind codurile caracteristice ale două organisme vii diferite, scrieți un program care să determine codul caracteristic al celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lor.


# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține:

* $n$ - codul caracteristic al primului organism
* $m$ - codul caracteristic al celui de-al doilea organism

# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` conține pe prima linie:

* $p$ – codul celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lui $n$ si $m$

# Restricții și precizări

* Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve the problem of finding the most evolved common ancestor's code characteristic between two given codes, we need to determine the longest common subsequence (LCS) of the two strings representing the codes. The LCS problem is a well-known problem in computer science and can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Read the input from the file `cod.in`.**
2. **Compute the LCS of the two given codes.**
3. **Write the LCS to the output file `cod.out`.**

The dynamic programming approach involves creating a 2D table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS of the substrings `n[0..i-1]` and `m[0..j-1]`. The table is filled using the following rules:
- If `n[i-1] == m[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

After filling the table, the LCS can be reconstructed by tracing back from `dp[len(n)][len(m)]`.

Here's the C++ code to implement this solution:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("cod.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("cod.out");

    std::string n, m;
    infile >> n >> m;

    int len_n = n.size();
    int len_m = m.size();

    // Create a 2D DP table
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(len_n + 1, std::vector<int>(len_m + 1, 0));

    // Fill the DP table
    for (int i = 1; i <= len_n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= len_m; ++j) {
            if (n[i-1] == m[j-1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Reconstruct the LCS from the DP table
    std::string lcs;
    int i = len_n, j = len_m;
    while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
        if (n[i-1] == m[j-1]) {
            lcs.push_back(n[i-1]);
            --i;
            --j;
        } else if (dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]) {
            --i;
        } else {
            --j;
        }
    }

    // The LCS is constructed in reverse order
    std::reverse(lcs.begin(), lcs.end());

    // Write the LCS to the output file
    outfile << lcs << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input:** The code reads the two characteristic codes from `cod.in`.
2. **DP Table Initialization:** A 2D vector `dp` is initialized to store the lengths of LCS for substrings of `n` and `m`.
3. **Filling the DP Table:** The nested loops fill the DP table based on whether the characters of `n` and `m` match or not.
4. **Reconstructing the LCS:** The LCS is reconstructed by tracing back through the DP table.
5. **Output:** The LCS is written to `cod.out`.

This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, adhering to the constraints provided.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the initial approach using the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm is not appropriate for this problem. The LCS algorithm finds the longest sequence that appears in both strings in the same order, but it does not necessarily find the largest possible common subsequence in terms of numerical value.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the largest common subsequence by value, which can be achieved by a different approach. We should consider all possible subsequences of the given numbers and find the common ones, then select the largest by value.

Here is the corrected approach:
1. Generate all possible subsequences of both numbers.
2. Find the common subsequences.
3. Determine the largest common subsequence by value.

To implement this, we can use a recursive function to generate all subsequences and then compare them.

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to generate all subsequences of a given string
void generateSubsequences(const std::string &s, int index, std::string current, std::unordered_set<std::string> &subsequences) {
    if (index == s.size()) {
        subsequences.insert(current);
        return;
    }
    // Exclude the current character
    generateSubsequences(s, index + 1, current, subsequences);
    // Include the current character
    generateSubsequences(s, index + 1, current + s[index], subsequences);
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("cod.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("cod.out");

    std::string n, m;
    infile >> n >> m;

    // Generate all subsequences for both strings
    std::unordered_set<std::string> subsequences_n, subsequences_m;
    generateSubsequences(n, 0, "", subsequences_n);
    generateSubsequences(m, 0, "", subsequences_m);

    // Find the common subsequences
    std::string largest_common_subsequence = "";
    for (const auto &subseq : subsequences_n) {
        if (subsequences_m.find(subseq) != subsequences_m.end()) {
            if (subseq.size() > largest_common_subsequence.size() || 
                (subseq.size() == largest_common_subsequence.size() && subseq > largest_common_subsequence)) {
                largest_common_subsequence = subseq;
            }
        }
    }

    // Write the largest common subsequence to the output file
    outfile << largest_common_subsequence << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input:** The code reads the two characteristic codes from `cod.in`.
2. **Generating Subsequences:** The `generateSubsequences` function generates all possible subsequences of a given string and stores them in a set.
3. **Finding Common Subsequences:** The code finds common subsequences between the two sets of subsequences.
4. **Selecting the Largest Common Subsequence:** The code iterates through the common subsequences and selects the largest one by value.
5. **Output:** The largest common subsequence is written to `cod.out`.

This approach ensures that we find the largest common subsequence by value, which should match the expected results.
