În podul casei, Andrei a găsit coperta unei cărţi vechi de-a bunicului său, şi împrăştiate prin mai multe cutii, paginile rupte din această carte. El se gândeşte că i-ar face o mare bucurie bunicului dacă ar reface cartea şi ar prinde paginile acesteia în copertă.

După ce a strâns laolaltă toate paginile găsite, Andrei îşi dă seama că acestea nu sunt puse în ordine şi o parte dintre ele s-au pierdut. Astfel, se hotărăşte să prindă împreună cu o agrafă paginile ce ar trebui aranjate una după alta în carte.

Cunoscând numărul fiecărei pagini din carte, găsite de Andrei, determinaţi care este numărul de agrafe de care are nevoie Andrei şi care este cel mai mare număr de pagini ce au fost prinse împreună cu o agrafă.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care să determine numărul de agrafe necesare pentru paginile cărţii şi cel mai mare număr de pagini ce au fost prinse împreună cu o agrafă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `pagini.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul $n$ de pagini, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii câte un singur număr natural nenul, reprezentând numărul unei pagini din carte.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `pagini.out` va conţine

- pe prima linie un singur număr reprezentând numărul de agrafe
- pe a doua linie un singur număr reprezentând cel mai mare număr de pagini ce au fost prinse împreună cu o agrafă. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Valorile din vector sunt cel mult egale cu $10^6$

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of clips required to group consecutive pages and find the largest group of consecutive pages. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Read Input:** Read the number of pages `n` and the list of page numbers from the input file.
2. **Sort Pages:** Sort the list of page numbers to easily identify consecutive sequences.
3. **Identify Consecutive Sequences:** Traverse the sorted list and count the number of consecutive sequences (clips) and the size of the largest sequence.
4. **Write Output:** Write the results to the output file.

The algorithm's complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`. This is efficient given the constraints.

Here is the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pagini.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pagini.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    std::vector<int> pages(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> pages[i];
    }

    // Sort the pages
    std::sort(pages.begin(), pages.end());

    int clips = 1; // At least one clip is needed if there's at least one page
    int max_group_size = 1;
    int current_group_size = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (pages[i] == pages[i - 1] + 1) {
            // Consecutive page
            current_group_size++;
        } else {
            // New clip needed
            clips++;
            if (current_group_size > max_group_size) {
                max_group_size = current_group_size;
            }
            current_group_size = 1;
        }
    }

    // Check the last group size
    if (current_group_size > max_group_size) {
        max_group_size = current_group_size;
    }

    outfile << clips << "\n";
    outfile << max_group_size << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of pages `n` and the page numbers from the input file `pagini.in`.
2. **Sorting Pages:**
   - We sort the `pages` vector to arrange the page numbers in ascending order.
3. **Identifying Consecutive Sequences:**
   - We initialize `clips` to 1 because we need at least one clip if there is at least one page.
   - We initialize `max_group_size` and `current_group_size` to 1.
   - We iterate through the sorted pages and check if the current page is consecutive to the previous one.
   - If it is, we increment `current_group_size`.
   - If it is not, we increment the `clips` count, update `max_group_size` if `current_group_size` is larger, and reset `current_group_size` to 1.
   - After the loop, we do a final check to update `max_group_size` if the last group was the largest.
4. **Writing Output:**
   - We write the number of clips and the size of the largest group to the output file `pagini.out`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently determine the required number of clips and the largest group size by leveraging sorting and a single pass through the sorted list.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there is an issue with how the clips are being counted. Specifically, the problem lies in the way we are determining new clips when encountering non-consecutive pages.

Let's re-evaluate the logic:
1. **Expected Output:** The expected output is `3` clips and the largest group of consecutive pages is `4`.
2. **Found Output:** The found output is `6` clips and the largest group of consecutive pages is `4`.

The issue is that the current logic increments the clip count too frequently, leading to an overestimation of the number of clips needed.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are correctly identifying groups of consecutive pages and only incrementing the clip count when a new group starts.

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Sort the Pages:** This allows us to easily identify consecutive sequences.
2. **Traverse the Sorted List:** Identify consecutive sequences and count the number of clips and the size of the largest group.

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("pagini.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("pagini.out");

    int n;
    infile >> n;

    std::vector<int> pages(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        infile >> pages[i];
    }

    // Sort the pages
    std::sort(pages.begin(), pages.end());

    int clips = 0;
    int max_group_size = 0;
    int current_group_size = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i == 0 || pages[i] != pages[i - 1] + 1) {
            // New clip needed
            clips++;
            if (current_group_size > max_group_size) {
                max_group_size = current_group_size;
            }
            current_group_size = 1;
        } else {
            // Consecutive page
            current_group_size++;
        }
    }

    // Final check for the last group
    if (current_group_size > max_group_size) {
        max_group_size = current_group_size;
    }

    outfile << clips << "\n";
    outfile << max_group_size << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of pages `n` and the page numbers from the input file `pagini.in`.

   - If it is consecutive, we increment `current_group_size`.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly increments the clip count for every non-consecutive page. This leads to an overestimation of the number of clips needed. The correct approach should only increment the clip count when a new sequence of consecutive pages starts.

            clips++;
            current_group_size = 1;
        } else {
            // Consecutive page

    outfile << clips << "\n";
    outfile << max_group_size << "\n";

    return 0;

This corrected solution ensures that we correctly count the number of clips and identify the largest group of consecutive pages. The key fix here is to correctly handle the initialization of `current_group_size` and ensure that `max_group_size` is updated correctly.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of pages `n` and the page numbers from the input file `pagini.in`.
2. **Sorting Pages:**
   - We sort the `pages` vector to arrange the page numbers in ascending order.
3. **Identifying Consecutive Sequences:**
   - We initialize `clips`, `max_group_size`, and `current_group_size` to 0.
   - We iterate through the sorted pages and check if the current page is consecutive to the previous one.
   - If it is not consecutive (or it's the first page), we increment the `clips` count and reset `current_group_size` to 1.
   - If it is consecutive, we increment `current_group_size`.
   - We update `max_group_size` whenever `current_group_size` exceeds it.
4. **Writing Output:**
   - We write the number of clips and the size of the largest group to the output file `pagini.out`.

This corrected solution ensures that we correctly count the number of clips and identify the largest group of consecutive pages. The key fix here is to correctly handle the initialization of `current_group_size` and ensure that `max_group_size` is updated correctly.
