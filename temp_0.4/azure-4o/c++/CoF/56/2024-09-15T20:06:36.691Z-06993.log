Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to use a shortest path algorithm tailored for the constraints provided. Given that we have dependencies between stories and we need to minimize the total duration while ensuring the dragon ends with at least one head, we can use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm will help us find the shortest path in a graph where nodes represent stories and edges represent the allowed transitions between stories.

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Story {
    int duration;
    int headsLost;
};

struct Edge {
    int to;
    int weight;
};

int main() {
    ifstream infile("zmeu.in");
    ofstream outfile("zmeu.out");

    int n, p, k;
    infile >> n >> p >> k;

    vector<Story> stories(p + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        infile >> stories[i].duration >> stories[i].headsLost;
    }

    vector<vector<Edge>> adj(p + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        infile >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back({v, stories[v].duration});
    }

    vector<int> dist(p + 1, INT_MAX);
    vector<int> heads(p + 1, 0);
    dist[1] = stories[1].duration;
    heads[1] = n - stories[1].headsLost;

    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    pq.push({dist[1], 1});

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int d = pq.top().first;
        int u = pq.top().second;
        pq.pop();

        if (d > dist[u]) continue;

        for (Edge &edge : adj[u]) {
            int v = edge.to;
            int weight = edge.weight;

            if (heads[u] - stories[v].headsLost > 0) {
                if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                    heads[v] = heads[u] - stories[v].headsLost;
                    pq.push({dist[v], v});
                }
            }
        }
    }

    if (dist[p] == INT_MAX) {
        outfile << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        outfile << dist[p] << endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of heads `n`, the number of stories `p`, and the number of constraints `k`.
2. **Storing Stories**: We store the duration and heads lost for each story in a vector of `Story` structs.
3. **Building the Graph**: We build an adjacency list to represent the dependencies between stories.
4. **Shortest Path Calculation**: We use a priority queue to implement a modified Dijkstra's algorithm. The priority queue helps us efficiently get the story with the minimum duration that we can process next.
5. **Updating Distances and Heads**: For each story, we update the minimum duration and the remaining heads after processing the story.
6. **Output Result**: If we can reach the last story with at least one head remaining, we output the minimum duration. Otherwise, we output `-1`.

This approach ensures that we find the optimal sequence of stories efficiently within the given constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there might be an issue with the logic that handles the constraints and the conditions for the dragon's heads. Let's re-evaluate the problem and implement a corrected solution.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Parsing**: We need to read the number of heads `n`, the number of stories `p`, and the number of constraints `k`.
2. **Graph Representation**: Each story can be represented as a node, and dependencies between stories can be represented as directed edges.
3. **Shortest Path with Constraints**: We need to find the shortest path from story 1 to story `p` while ensuring that the dragon has at least one head left at the end.

### Key Points to Address
1. **Initial Conditions**: The dragon starts with `n` heads and must end with at least one head.
2. **Graph Traversal**: We need to ensure that the traversal respects the constraints and updates the number of heads correctly.

### Revised Solution
We'll use a dynamic programming approach combined with a breadth-first search (BFS) to handle the constraints and ensure the dragon's heads are managed properly.

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Story {
    int duration;
    int headsLost;
};

struct State {
    int story;
    int duration;
    int headsLeft;
};

int main() {
    ifstream infile("zmeu.in");
    ofstream outfile("zmeu.out");

    int n, p, k;
    infile >> n >> p >> k;

    vector<Story> stories(p + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        infile >> stories[i].duration >> stories[i].headsLost;
    }

    vector<vector<int>> adj(p + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        infile >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
    }

    vector<int> dist(p + 1, INT_MAX);
    vector<int> heads(p + 1, 0);
    dist[1] = stories[1].duration;
    heads[1] = n - stories[1].headsLost;

    queue<State> q;
    q.push({1, stories[1].duration, heads[1]});

    while (!q.empty()) {
        State current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        int u = current.story;
        int currentDuration = current.duration;
        int currentHeadsLeft = current.headsLeft;

        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            int newDuration = currentDuration + stories[v].duration;
            int newHeadsLeft = currentHeadsLeft - stories[v].headsLost;

            if (newHeadsLeft > 0 && newDuration < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = newDuration;
                heads[v] = newHeadsLeft;
                q.push({v, newDuration, newHeadsLeft});
            }
        }
    }

    if (dist[p] == INT_MAX) {
        outfile << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        outfile << dist[p] << endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Reading**: We read the number of heads `n`, stories `p`, and constraints `k`.
2. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list to represent the dependencies between stories.
3. **Initialization**: We initialize the distance and heads arrays. The distance array keeps track of the minimum duration to reach each story, and the heads array keeps track of the remaining heads after reaching each story.
4. **BFS with State Tracking**: We use a queue to perform a breadth-first search. Each state in the queue contains the current story, the accumulated duration, and the remaining heads.
5. **Updating States**: For each story, we update the duration and heads left if the new path offers a shorter duration and leaves the dragon with more than zero heads.
6. **Output**: If we can reach the last story with at least one head remaining, we output the minimum duration. Otherwise, we output `-1`.

This approach ensures that we respect the constraints and correctly manage the dragon's heads while finding the shortest path.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the current approach may not be correctly handling the constraints and transitions between stories. Specifically, the BFS and topological sort approaches may not be correctly updating or propagating states to ensure the shortest path is found while maintaining the required number of heads.

### Key Points to Address
1. **Initial Conditions**: The dragon starts with `n` heads and must end with at least one head.
2. **Graph Traversal**: Ensure that the traversal respects the constraints and updates the number of heads correctly.
3. **State Management**: Properly manage and propagate states to ensure the shortest path is found.

### Revised Solution
We'll use a dynamic programming approach combined with a topological sort to handle the constraints and ensure the dragon's heads are managed properly.

Here is the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Story {
    int duration;
    int headsLost;
};

int main() {
    ifstream infile("zmeu.in");
    ofstream outfile("zmeu.out");

    int n, p, k;
    infile >> n >> p >> k;

    vector<Story> stories(p + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        infile >> stories[i].duration >> stories[i].headsLost;
    }

    vector<vector<int>> adj(p + 1);
    vector<int> inDegree(p + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        infile >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        inDegree[v]++;
    }

    vector<int> dist(p + 1, INT_MAX);
    vector<int> heads(p + 1, 0);
    dist[1] = stories[1].duration;
    heads[1] = n - stories[1].headsLost;

    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= p; ++i) {
        if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
            q.push(i);
        }
    }

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            if (heads[u] - stories[v].headsLost > 0) {
                if (dist[u] + stories[v].duration < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + stories[v].duration;
                    heads[v] = heads[u] - stories[v].headsLost;
                }
            }

            if (--inDegree[v] == 0) {
                q.push(v);
            }
        }
    }

    if (dist[p] == INT_MAX || heads[p] <= 0) {
        outfile << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        outfile << dist[p] << endl;
    }

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();
    return 0;
}

```

### Explanation
1. **Input Reading**: We read the number of heads `n`, stories `p`, and constraints `k`.
2. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list to represent the dependencies between stories and track the in-degree of each node.
3. **Initialization**: We initialize the distance and heads arrays. The distance array keeps track of the minimum duration to reach each story, and the heads array keeps track of the remaining heads after reaching each story.
4. **Topological Sort with State Tracking**: We use a queue to perform a topological sort. Each node is processed in topological order, ensuring that all dependencies are respected.
5. **Updating States**: For each story, we update the duration and heads left if the new path offers a shorter duration and leaves the dragon with more than zero heads.
6. **Output**: If we can reach the last story with at least one head remaining, we output the minimum duration. Otherwise, we output `-1`.

This approach ensures that we respect the constraints and correctly manage the dragon's heads while finding the shortest path.
