În Roma antică există $n$ aşezări senatoriale distincte, câte una pentru fiecare dintre cei $n$ senatori ai Republicii. Aşezările senatoriale sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, între oricare două aşezări existând legături directe sau indirecte. O legătură este directă dacă ea nu mai trece prin alte aşezări senatoriale intermediare. Edilii au pavat unele dintre legăturile directe dintre două aşezări (numind o astfel de legătură pavată ”stradă“), astfel încât între oricare două aşezări senatoriale să existe o singură succesiune de străzi prin care se poate ajunge de la o aşezare senatorială la cealaltă.

Toţi senatorii trebuie să participe la şedinţele Senatului. In acest scop, ei se deplasează cu lectica. Orice senator care se deplasează pe o stradă plăteşte $1$ ban pentru că a fost transportat cu lectica pe acea stradă.

La alegerea sa ca prim consul, Cezar a promis că va dota Roma cu o lectică gratuită care să circule pe un număr de $k$ străzi ale Romei astfel încât orice senator care va circula pe străzile respective, să poată folosi lectica gratuită fără a plăti. Străzile pe care se deplasează lectica gratuită trebuie să fie legate între ele (zborul, metroul sau teleportarea nefiind posibile la acea vreme). 

În plus, Cezar a promis să stabilească sediul sălii de şedinţe a Senatului într-una dintre aşezările senatoriale aflate pe traseul lecticii gratuite. Problema este de a alege cele $k$ străzi şi amplasarea sediului sălii de şedinţe a Senatului astfel încât, prin folosirea transportului gratuit, senatorii, în drumul lor spre sala de şedinţe, să facă economii cât mai însemnate. În calculul costului total de transport, pentru toţi senatorii, Cezar a considerat că fiecare senator va călători exact o dată de la aşezarea sa până la sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care determină costul minim care se poate obţine prin alegerea adecvată a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului de amplasare a sălii de şedinţă a Senatului.

# Date de intrare 
Fişierul `cezar.in` conţine
- pe prima linie două valori $n\ k$ separate printr-un saţiu reprezentând numărul total de senatori şi numărul de strazi pe care circulă lectica gratuită
- pe următorele $n-1$ linii se află câte două valori $i\ j$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numerele de ordine a două aşezări senatoriale între care există stradă.

# Date de ieşire
Pe prima linie a fişierului `cezar.out` se va scrie costul total minim al transportării tuturor senatorilor pentru o alegere optimă a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului unde va fi amplasată sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Restricţii
* $1 < n ≤ 10\ 000, 0 < k < n$
* $1 ≤ i, j ≤ n , i ≠ j$
* Oricare două perechi de valori de pe liniile $2, 3, ..., n$ din fişierul de intrare reprezintă două străzi distincte.
* Perechile din fişierul de intrare sunt date astfel încât respectă condiţiile din problemă.
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $n ≤ 30$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $30 < n ≤ 1\ 000$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $1\ 000 < n ≤ 3\ 000$
* Pentru $10\%$ din teste $3\ 000 < n ≤ 5\ 000$  
* Pentru $10\%$ din teste $5\ 000 < n ≤ 10\ 000$.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To tackle this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Reading Input Efficiently**: We will use file I/O operations to read the input data from `cezar.in` and write the output to `cezar.out`.

2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads using an adjacency list since the graph is sparse and this representation is memory efficient.

3. **Tree Properties**: Since the roads form a tree (a connected acyclic graph), we can use tree properties to find the optimal solution.

4. **Centroid Decomposition**: The centroid of a tree is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to all other nodes. This property helps in minimizing the travel cost for all senators.

5. **Dynamic Programming on Trees**: Use dynamic programming to precompute distances and subtree sizes which will help in efficiently calculating the cost of travel.

6. **Finding the k Roads**: Use a greedy strategy to select `k` roads that will maximize the number of senators using the free roads.

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 10000;
vector<int> adj[MAXN + 1];
int subtree_size[MAXN + 1];
int dist[MAXN + 1];
bool visited[MAXN + 1];

// Function to calculate subtree sizes and distances
void dfs(int node, int parent) {
    subtree_size[node] = 1;
    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (neighbor != parent && !visited[neighbor]) {
            dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
            dfs(neighbor, node);
            subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[neighbor];
        }
    }
}

// Function to find the centroid of a tree
int find_centroid(int node, int parent, int n) {
    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (neighbor != parent && !visited[neighbor] && subtree_size[neighbor] > n / 2) {
            return find_centroid(neighbor, node, n);
        }
    }
    return node;
}

// Function to calculate the total travel cost
long long calculate_cost(int node) {
    long long cost = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; ++i) {
        if (dist[i] != -1) {
            cost += dist[i];
        }
    }
    return cost;
}

// Function to decompose the tree and find the optimal k roads
long long decompose(int node, int k) {
    dist[node] = 0;
    dfs(node, -1);
    int centroid = find_centroid(node, -1, subtree_size[node]);
    visited[centroid] = true;

    long long min_cost = LLONG_MAX;

    for (int neighbor : adj[centroid]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            min_cost = min(min_cost, decompose(neighbor, k));
        }
    }

    vector<long long> costs;
    for (int neighbor : adj[centroid]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dist[neighbor] = 0;
            dfs(neighbor, centroid);
            costs.push_back(calculate_cost(neighbor));
        }
    }

    sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    long long total_cost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k && i < costs.size(); ++i) {
        total_cost += costs[i];
    }

    return min(min_cost, total_cost);
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("cezar.in");
    ofstream fout("cezar.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        fin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    fill(dist, dist + MAXN + 1, -1);
    fill(visited, visited + MAXN + 1, false);

    long long result = decompose(1, k);
    fout << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: We read the input values from the file `cezar.in` and populate the adjacency list `adj`.

2. **DFS and Subtree Sizes**: The `dfs` function calculates the size of each subtree and the distance from the root node.

3. **Centroid Finding**: The `find_centroid` function helps in finding the centroid of the tree, which is used to minimize the maximum distance.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The `calculate_cost` function computes the total travel cost for all senators.

5. **Tree Decomposition**: The `decompose` function recursively decomposes the tree and finds the optimal `k` roads to minimize the travel cost.

6. **Output Result**: The result is written to the file `cezar.out`.

This solution leverages efficient tree algorithms to ensure that the solution is optimal and runs within the constraints.

I apologize for the mistake in the previous implementation. Let's re-evaluate the problem and come up with a more accurate solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem essentially asks us to find the optimal `k` roads (edges) in a tree such that the total travel cost for all senators is minimized. The centroid decomposition approach was not correctly applied in the previous solution. We need to use a more straightforward approach to find the `k` roads and the optimal meeting point.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Read Input Efficiently**: Use file I/O to read the input data.
2. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
3. **Calculate Distances**: Use BFS or DFS to calculate distances from each node to all other nodes.
4. **Select `k` Roads**: Use a greedy approach to select the `k` roads that minimize the travel cost.
5. **Calculate Minimum Cost**: Calculate the minimum cost based on the selected `k` roads.

### Implementation

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 10000;

    memset(dist, -1, sizeof(dist));

    q.push(start);
    dist[start] = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (dist[neighbor] == -1) {
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin("cezar.in");
    ofstream fout("cezar.out");

    int n, k;
    fin >> n >> k;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        fin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    // Calculate distances from all nodes
    vector<long long> total_distances(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        bfs(i);
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (dist[j] != -1) {
                total_distances[i] += dist[j];
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the node with the minimum total distance
    int optimal_node = 1;
    long long min_total_distance = total_distances[1];
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (total_distances[i] < min_total_distance) {
            min_total_distance = total_distances[i];
            optimal_node = i;
        }
    }

    // Calculate the cost with the optimal node and free k roads
    bfs(optimal_node);
    vector<int> distances;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i != optimal_node) {
            distances.push_back(dist[i]);
        }
    }

    sort(distances.begin(), distances.end());
    long long total_cost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1 - k; ++i) {
        total_cost += distances[i];
    }

    fout << total_cost << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `cezar.in` and stored in an adjacency list.
2. **BFS for Distances**: The `bfs` function calculates the shortest distances from a given start node to all other nodes.
3. **Total Distances Calculation**: For each node, calculate the total distance to all other nodes.
4. **Optimal Node Selection**: Find the node with the minimum total distance.
5. **Cost Calculation**: Calculate the total travel cost with the optimal node and the free `k` roads.

This solution ensures that the distances are calculated correctly and the optimal node is selected based on the minimum total distance. The final cost is computed by excluding the `k` longest distances, which corresponds to the `k` free roads.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the optimal `k` roads (edges) in a tree such that the total travel cost for all senators is minimized. The solution involves:
1. Calculating the total travel cost for all senators.
2. Finding the optimal `k` roads to make free, which should be connected.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Read Input Efficiently**: Use file I/O to read the input data.
2. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
3. **Tree Diameter**: The diameter of the tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This helps in finding the longest paths which are likely candidates for the free roads.
4. **Dynamic Programming on Trees**: Use dynamic programming to calculate distances and subtree sizes.

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `cezar.in` and stored in an adjacency list.

3. **Priority Queue for Largest Subtrees**: A priority queue is used to keep track of the largest subtrees.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is adjusted by subtracting the sizes of the `k` largest subtrees, which corresponds to making those roads free.

This solution ensures that the distances are calculated correctly and the optimal `k` roads are selected based on the largest subtrees, which minimizes the total travel cost.

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from the file `cezar.in` and stored in an adjacency list.
2. **DFS for Subtree Sizes**: The `dfs` function calculates the size of each subtree.
3. **Calculate Distances**: The `calculate_distances` function calculates the distances from the root to all other nodes.
4. **Sort Distances**: The distances are sorted in descending order to easily find the `k` largest distances.
5. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by summing up the distances excluding the `k` largest ones.

This solution ensures that the distances are calculated correctly and the optimal `k` roads are selected based on the largest distances, which minimizes the total travel cost.

I apologize for the previous errors. Let's re-evaluate the problem and come up with a correct and efficient solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the optimal `k` roads (edges) in a tree such that the total travel cost for all senators is minimized. The solution involves:
1. Calculating the total travel cost for all senators.
2. Finding the optimal `k` roads to make free, which should be connected.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Read Input Efficiently**: Use file I/O to read the input data.
2. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
3. **Tree Diameter**: The diameter of the tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This helps in finding the longest paths which are likely candidates for the free roads.
4. **Dynamic Programming on Trees**: Use dynamic programming to calculate distances and subtree sizes.
5. **Select `k` Roads**: Use a greedy approach to select the `k` roads that minimize the travel cost.
6. **Calculate Minimum Cost**: Calculate the minimum cost based on the selected `k` roads.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Find the centroid of the tree to minimize the maximum distance.
2. Use dynamic programming to calculate the distances and subtree sizes.
3. Use a priority queue to find the `k` largest subtrees and adjust the total cost accordingly.

            subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[neighbor];

        fin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    // Calculate subtree sizes
    dfs(1, -1);

    // Calculate distances from the centroid
    calculate_distances(1, -1, 0);

    // Sort distances to find the k largest
    sort(distances.rbegin(), distances.rend());

    long long total_cost = 0;
