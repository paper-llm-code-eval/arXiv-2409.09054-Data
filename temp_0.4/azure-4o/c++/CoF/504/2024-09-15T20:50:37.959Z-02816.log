Construcția unei noi clădiri a fost finalizată! Frank, celebrul arhitect a  făcut o poză cu fațada. Nu este chiar mulțumit de poză deoarece a observat o înclinație a pozei relativ la orizontală. Asta se poate repara printr-o rotație, iar Frank se întreabă dacă procesul de îndreptare nu ar putea fi automatizat.

Cu acest scop, imaginea este transformată într-o mulțime de segmente din plan, detectate automat cu algoritmi speciali, ca în imaginea din dreapta. Segmentele care se obțin sunt identificate prin cele două extremități, puncte având coordonate numere naturale, în sistemul *xOy*: ($x_1$, $y_1$), ($x_2$, $y_2$). Un segment este numit *aliniat* cu axele dacă este orizontal (paralel cu axa *Ox*, deci $y_1=y_2$) sau vertical (paralel cu axa *Oy*, deci $x_1=x_2$).
Prin rotația imaginii în ansamblu, o parte dintre segmente devin *aliniate* cu cele două axe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru o mulțime de segmente determină numărul maxim de segmente care se pot *alinia*, prin rotirea cu un același unghi a tuturor segmentelor. Unghiul de rotație poate fi orice număr real.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `arhitect.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul de segmente $N$ și pe următoarele $N$ linii câte patru numere întregi separate prin câte un spațiu $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, în această ordine, cu semnificația din enunț, coordonatele ce definesc extremitățile segmentelor.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `arhitect.out` conține pe prima linie numărul maxim de segmente determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$ și $1 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;
* Toate segmentele au lungime nenulă;
* Pentru $40$ de puncte, segmentele inițiale sunt paralele cu *Ox*, *Oy* sau cu bisectoarele axelor de coordonate.
* Pentru $60$ de puncte, fără resticții suplimentare.

Before writing my solution in c++, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the maximum number of segments that can be aligned with the axes through rotation. The key observation here is that each segment can be characterized by its angle with respect to the x-axis. By rotating the entire set of segments, we can align segments with the axes if they have the same angle.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate Angles**: For each segment, calculate the angle it makes with the x-axis. This angle can be found using the arctangent function.
2. **Count Angles**: Use a map to count how many segments have the same angle.
3. **Find Maximum Count**: The maximum value in this map will be the answer, as it represents the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the image.

The following C++ code implements this approach efficiently:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<double, int> angle_count;
    double max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        // Calculate the angle of the segment with respect to the x-axis
        double angle = atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1);
        
        // Increment the count of this angle
        angle_count[angle]++;
        
        // Update the maximum count
        if (angle_count[angle] > max_count) {
            max_count = angle_count[angle];
        }
    }

    outfile << static_cast<int>(max_count) << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of segments `N` and then reads each segment's coordinates.
2. **Calculating Angles**: For each segment, the angle with respect to the x-axis is calculated using `atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. This function returns the angle in radians.
3. **Counting Angles**: A map (`angle_count`) is used to count how many segments have the same angle.
4. **Finding Maximum Count**: The maximum value in the map is tracked and written to the output file.

This solution efficiently handles the input size constraints and ensures that the code runs in linear time, O(N), which is optimal for this problem.

The initial solution did not account for the fact that segments can be aligned with the axes after rotation. Specifically, it missed the possibility of aligning segments that are initially vertical or horizontal.

To fix this, we need to consider the following:
1. Segments that are initially vertical or horizontal should be counted directly.
2. For other segments, we should calculate their angles and count how many segments can be aligned by rotating the image.

Here's the revised approach:
1. **Count Initial Alignments**: Directly count segments that are already aligned with the x or y axis.
2. **Calculate and Count Angles**: For other segments, calculate their angles and use a map to count the number of segments with each angle.
3. **Find Maximum Count**: The maximum value from the map and the count of initially aligned segments will give the result.

Here's the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<double, int> angle_count;
    int aligned_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        if (x1 == x2 || y1 == y2) {
            // Segment is already aligned with x or y axis
            aligned_count++;
        } else {
            // Calculate the angle of the segment with respect to the x-axis
            double angle = atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1);
            angle_count[angle]++;
        }
    }

    int max_count = aligned_count;
    for (const auto& pair : angle_count) {
        max_count = std::max(max_count, pair.second);
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of segments `N` and then reads each segment's coordinates.
2. **Counting Initial Alignments**: Segments that are already vertical or horizontal are counted directly.
3. **Calculating Angles**: For other segments, the angle with respect to the x-axis is calculated using `atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. This function returns the angle in radians.
4. **Counting Angles**: A map (`angle_count`) is used to count how many segments have the same angle.
5. **Finding Maximum Count**: The maximum value in the map and the count of initially aligned segments are compared to find the result.

This solution ensures that segments already aligned with the axes are counted correctly and handles the input size constraints efficiently.

The previous solution did not correctly handle the counting of segments that can be aligned after rotation. Specifically, it did not consider that segments with the same slope (angle) can be aligned together, regardless of their initial alignment with the axes.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Normalize the angles of segments to account for their slopes.
2. Use a map to count the frequency of each normalized slope.
3. Find the maximum count from the map.

Here's the corrected approach:
1. **Normalize Slopes**: For each segment, calculate the slope and normalize it to handle different representations of the same slope.
2. **Count Slopes**: Use a map to count how many segments have the same normalized slope.
3. **Find Maximum Count**: The maximum value in the map will be the answer.

Here's the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

std::pair<int, int> normalize_slope(int dx, int dy) {
    if (dx == 0) return {0, 1}; // vertical line
    if (dy == 0) return {1, 0}; // horizontal line
    int g = std::gcd(dx, dy);
    dx /= g;
    dy /= g;
    if (dx < 0) {
        dx = -dx;
        dy = -dy;
    }
    return {dx, dy};
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<std::pair<int, int>, int, boost::hash<std::pair<int, int>>> slope_count;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        int dx = x2 - x1;
        int dy = y2 - y1;

        auto slope = normalize_slope(dx, dy);
        slope_count[slope]++;
        max_count = std::max(max_count, slope_count[slope]);
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of segments `N` and then reads each segment's coordinates.
2. **Normalize Slopes**: For each segment, the slope is calculated as the difference in x and y coordinates. The slope is then normalized using the greatest common divisor (GCD) to ensure that different representations of the same slope are counted together. The normalization also ensures that slopes are consistently represented with a positive x component.
3. **Counting Slopes**: A map (`slope_count`) is used to count how many segments have the same normalized slope.
4. **Finding Maximum Count**: The maximum value in the map is tracked and written to the output file.

This solution ensures that segments with the same slope are correctly counted and handles the input size constraints efficiently. The use of normalization ensures that different representations of the same slope are treated as identical.

The compilation errors are due to two main issues:
1. The `std::gcd` function is available only in C++17 and later. If the compiler does not support C++17, this will cause an error.
2. The `boost::hash` was used without including the necessary Boost headers, and it's not necessary for this problem. We can create a custom hash function for `std::pair<int, int>` instead.

To fix these issues:
1. Ensure the code is compiled with C++17 or later.
2. Implement a custom hash function for `std::pair<int, int>`.

Here is the corrected code with these fixes:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of segments `N` and then reads each segment's coordinates.
2. **Normalize Slopes**: For each segment, the slope is calculated as the difference in x and y coordinates. The slope is then normalized using the greatest common divisor (GCD) to ensure that different representations of the same slope are counted together. The normalization also ensures that slopes are consistently represented with a positive x component.
3. **Counting Slopes**: A map (`slope_count`) is used to count how many segments have the same normalized slope.
4. **Finding Maximum Count**: The maximum value in the map is tracked and written to the output file.

This solution ensures that segments with the same slope are correctly counted and handles the input size constraints efficiently. The use of normalization ensures that different representations of the same slope are treated as identical.

The previous solution did not correctly handle the counting of segments that can be aligned by rotating the image. Specifically, it did not correctly account for segments that are already aligned with the axes.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Normalize the slopes of all segments.
2. Use a map to count the frequency of each normalized slope.
3. Find the maximum count from the map, which will give us the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the image.

Here's the corrected approach:
1. **Normalize Slopes**: For each segment, calculate the slope and normalize it to handle different representations of the same slope.
2. **Count Slopes**: Use a map to count the frequency of each normalized slope.
3. **Find Maximum Count**: The maximum value from the map will give the result.

Here's the corrected C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

// Custom hash function for std::pair<int, int>
struct pair_hash {
    template <class T1, class T2>
    std::size_t operator() (const std::pair<T1, T2>& pair) const {
        return std::hash<T1>()(pair.first) ^ std::hash<T2>()(pair.second);
    }
};

// Function to calculate the greatest common divisor
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b) {
        int t = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = t;
    }
    return a;
}

// Function to normalize the slope
std::pair<int, int> normalize_slope(int dx, int dy) {
    if (dx == 0) return {0, 1}; // vertical line
    if (dy == 0) return {1, 0}; // horizontal line
    int g = gcd(abs(dx), abs(dy));
    dx /= g;
    dy /= g;
    if (dx < 0) {
        dx = -dx;
        dy = -dy;
    }
    return {dx, dy};
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile("arhitect.in");
    std::ofstream outfile("arhitect.out");

    int N;
    infile >> N;

    std::unordered_map<std::pair<int, int>, int, pair_hash> slope_count;
    int max_count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int x1, y1, x2, y2;
        infile >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;

        int dx = x2 - x1;
        int dy = y2 - y1;

        auto slope = normalize_slope(dx, dy);
        slope_count[slope]++;
        max_count = std::max(max_count, slope_count[slope]);
    }

    outfile << max_count << std::endl;

    infile.close();
    outfile.close();

    return 0;
}
```
