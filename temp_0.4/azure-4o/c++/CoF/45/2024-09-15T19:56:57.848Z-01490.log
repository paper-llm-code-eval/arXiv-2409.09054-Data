Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: The input is read from the file `iepuri.in` using `std::ifstream`. The number of rabbits `N` and the maximum number of carrots `K` are read first. Then, the hierarchy of the rabbits is read and stored in an adjacency list `adj`.

2. **DFS and DP Initialization**: A depth-first search (DFS) is performed starting from the root rabbit (assumed to be rabbit 1). During the DFS, the dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is filled. `dp[node][i]` represents the number of ways to distribute carrots such that the rabbit `node` eats `i` carrots.

3. **DP Transition**: For each node, a temporary DP table `temp` is used to handle the transitions. The table is updated based on the number of ways to distribute carrots to the children of the current node, ensuring that each child eats more carrots than the parent.

4. **Result Calculation**: After the DFS completes, the result is the sum of all possible ways for the root rabbit to eat between 1 and `K` carrots, modulo 30011.

5. **Output**: The result is written to the file `iepuri.out` using `std::ofstream`.

This solution ensures efficient computation by leveraging DFS and DP, and it adheres to the constraints and requirements provided in the problem statement.

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to identify the discrepancy.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to distribute carrots among rabbits in a hierarchical structure such that each rabbit eats between 1 and `K` carrots, and each rabbit eats fewer carrots than its direct subordinates. The number of valid distributions should be computed modulo 30011.

### Issue Identification
The provided solution initializes the DP table incorrectly and doesn't account for the hierarchical constraints properly. Specifically:
1. The DP transitions are not correctly ensuring that each rabbit eats fewer carrots than its subordinates.
2. The initial DP values and transitions might not be correctly set up.

### Solution Strategy
We need to:
1. Perform a DFS to traverse the hierarchy.
2. Use dynamic programming to count valid distributions.
3. Ensure that each rabbit eats fewer carrots than its subordinates.

### Corrected Solution
Here is the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> adj[101];
int dp[101][101];
int N, K;

void dfs(int node) {
    std::vector<int> children;
    for (int child : adj[node]) {
        dfs(child);
        children.push_back(child);
    }

    int temp[101][101];
    memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));
    temp[0][0] = 1;

    for (int child : children) {
        int newTemp[101][101];
        memset(newTemp, 0, sizeof(newTemp));

        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= K; ++j) {
                if (temp[i][j] == 0) continue;
                for (int k = 1; k <= K; ++k) {
                    if (k > j) {
                        newTemp[i + 1][k] = (newTemp[i + 1][k] + temp[i][j] * dp[child][k]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        memcpy(temp, newTemp, sizeof(temp));
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        dp[node][i] = temp[children.size()][i];
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;

    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int a, b;
        fin >> a >> b;
        adj[a].push_back(b);
    }

    dfs(1);

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[1][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Input Reading**: The input is read from the file `iepuri.in` using `std::ifstream`. The number of rabbits `N` and the maximum number of carrots `K` are read first. Then, the hierarchy of the rabbits is read and stored in an adjacency list `adj`.

2. **DFS and DP Initialization**: A depth-first search (DFS) is performed starting from the root rabbit (assumed to be rabbit 1). During the DFS, the dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is filled. `dp[node][i]` represents the number of ways to distribute carrots such that the rabbit `node` eats `i` carrots.

3. **DP Transition**: For each node, the DP table is initialized to 1 for each possible number of carrots (1 to `K`). As we process each child, we update the DP table to ensure that each child eats more carrots than the parent.

4. **Result Calculation**: After the DFS completes, the result is the sum of all possible ways for the root rabbit to eat between 1 and `K` carrots, modulo 30011.

5. **Output**: The result is written to the file `iepuri.out` using `std::ofstream`.

This solution ensures efficient computation by leveraging DFS and DP, and it adheres to the constraints and requirements provided in the problem statement. The corrected approach carefully handles the hierarchical constraints and ensures that the DP transitions are correctly implemented.

The previous attempts did not correctly handle the hierarchical constraints and dynamic programming transitions. Let's re-evaluate the problem and provide a correct implementation.

### Problem Recap
We need to distribute carrots among rabbits in a hierarchical structure such that:
1. Each rabbit eats between 1 and `K` carrots.
2. Each rabbit eats fewer carrots than its direct subordinates.
3. The result should be computed modulo 30011.

### Steps to Solve
1. Parse the input to build the hierarchy.
2. Use DFS to traverse the hierarchy.
3. Use dynamic programming to count valid distributions while ensuring the hierarchical constraints.

### Corrected Solution
Here is the corrected and optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

const int MOD = 30011;

std::vector<int> adj[101];
int dp[101][101];
int N, K;

void dfs(int node) {
    // Initialize DP table for the current node
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        dp[node][i] = 1;
    }

    // Process all children of the current node
    for (int child : adj[node]) {
        dfs(child);

        int temp[101] = {0};

        for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= K; ++j) {
                temp[j] = (temp[j] + dp[node][i] * dp[child][j]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
            dp[node][i] = temp[i];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ifstream fin("iepuri.in");
    std::ofstream fout("iepuri.out");

    fin >> N >> K;

    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
        int a, b;
        fin >> a >> b;
        adj[a].push_back(b);
    }

    dfs(1);

    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[1][i]) % MOD;
    }

    fout << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
