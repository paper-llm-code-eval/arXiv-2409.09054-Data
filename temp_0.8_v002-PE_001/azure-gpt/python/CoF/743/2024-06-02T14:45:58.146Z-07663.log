Fiind elev la un liceu de artă, secţia muzică, Andrei îşi propune să studieze o gamă nouă formată din $10$ note muzicale. Pasionat şi de matematică îşi propune pornind de la două numere naturale $a$ şi $b$ ($a < b$) să compună o „Simfonie interminabilă”, generând un şir de note în gama cea nouă. Astfel, el generează fiecare notă a simfoniei înmulţind pe $a$ cu $10$ şi împărţind rezultatul la $b$ (împărţire întreagă). Pentru a nu genera aceeaşi notă, el modifică de fiecare dată pe $a$, înlocuindu-l cu restul împărţirii lui $a \cdot 10$ la $b$. Deci notele sunt generate după regula $a \cdot 10$ div $b$, unde după fiecare pas a se schimbă astfel: $a = a \cdot 10$ mod $b$ (operaţia div reprezintă câtul întreg al împărţirii, iar mod este întregul ce reprezintă restul împărţirii întregi a două numere).
Astfel, pornind de la $a = 42$ şi $b = 130$, el va genera notele: $3 \ 2 \ 3 \ 0 \ 7 \ 6 \ 9 \ 2 \ 3 \ 0 \ 7 \ 6 \ 9 \ 2$ etc.
 
* $3 = 42 \cdot 10$ div $130$, iar $a$ devine $a = 42 * 10$ mod $130$, deci $a = 30$;
* $2 = 30 \cdot 10$ div $130$, $a = 300$ mod $130$, $a = 40$;
* $3 = 40 \cdot 10$ div $130$, $a = 400$ mod $130$, $a = 10$;
* $0 = 10 \cdot 10$ div $130$, $a = 100$ mod $130$, $a = 100$;
* $7 = 100 \cdot 10$ div $130$, $a = 1000$ mod $130$, $a = 90$;
* $6 = 90 \cdot 10$ div $130$, $a = 900$ mod $130$, $a = 120$;
* $9 = 120 \cdot 10$ div $130$, $a = 1200$ mod $130$, $a = 30$;
* $2 = 30 \cdot 10$ div $130$, $a = 300$ mod $130$, $a = 40$;
etc.

Ascultând simfonia, Andrei constată că, de la un moment dat, o secvenţă începe să se repete identic de un număr infinit de ori. Andrei numeşte secvenţa formată de primele note, cele aflate înaintea secvenţei care se repetă, „tema”, iar secvenţa care se repetă, „refrenul” simfoniei. De exemplu, în secvenţa anterioară, $3$ este tema, iar $230769$ este refrenul. El consideră tema şi refrenul cu lungimi cât mai mici posibil. Astfel, în exemplul anterior, nu se pot considera temă respectiv refren nici $32$ şi $307692$, nici $3$ şi $230769230769$. Există şi cazul în care nu există temă, adică simfonia începe direct cu refrenul.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care, citind două numere naturale $a$ şi $b$ ($a < b$), va determina cifrele temei şi cifrele refrenului. Se vor afişa cifrele temei, în continuare cifrele refrenului apoi un spaţiu urmat de un număr reprezentând câte cifre are refrenul. 

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `muzica.in` conţine pe prima linie două valori: $a$ şi $b$ numere naturale, separate printr-un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `muzica.out` va conţine o singură linie cu cifrele temei urmate în continuare de cifrele refrenului şi, după un spaţiu, numărul de cifre ale refrenului.

It does not use the `input()` or `print()` functions, and it uses optimal ways to handle strings and arrays to minimize memory usage.

It seems that the execution environment does not have the `numpy` library installed. Since we're working with a memory constraint and want to optimize our solution for both time and memory usage, we can avoid using `numpy` and use a standard Python list to keep track of remainders.

Here's the revised solution without `numpy`:

```python
def find_theme_and_refrain(a, b):
    # Initialize variables and list to keep track of notes and remainders
    notes = []
    remainders = [-1] * b  # Create a list initialized with -1
    ref_start = 0  # The index where the refrain starts
    while True:
        note = (a * 10) // b
        a = (a * 10) % b
        if remainders[a] != -1:  # If we have seen this remainder before, we found the refrain
            ref_start = remainders[a]  # Refrain starts from the index stored in remainders list
            break
        remainders[a] = len(notes)  # Store the index of the current note for this remainder
        notes.append(note)
        if len(notes) > b:  # If the notes exceed the possible unique remainders (b), break to avoid an infinite loop
            break
    
    # Theme is everything before the refrain; refrain is from ref_start to the end
    theme = notes[:ref_start]
    refrain = notes[ref_start:]
    return theme, refrain

# Read input data
with open('muzica.in', 'r') as file:
    a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find theme and refrain
theme, refrain = find_theme_and_refrain(a, b)

# Write output data
with open('muzica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(''.join(map(str, theme)) + ''.join(map(str, refrain)) + ' ' + str(len(refrain)))
```

The revised solution uses a list of length `b` filled with `-1` to track whether a remainder has been seen before. When a new remainder is encountered, we update the list at the index of the remainder with the current length of the `notes` list, which represents the position of the note in the sequence. If the remainder has been seen before, that indicates the start of the refrain. The solution should now work without requiring any external libraries and should be within the memory limits of the challenge.

Analyzing the difference between the expected output and the found output, we can see that the found output is missing the last digit of the refrain. This points out that we might be encountering a premature termination of the loop when we shouldn't, or we're not handling the case correctly when the remainder becomes zero, which should still count as part of the refrain.

Upon reviewing the previous implementation, we notice that the premature termination check `if len(notes) > b:` is flawed. This check may lead to an incorrect assumption that once the length of notes exceeds `b`, a cycle must have been found. However, it's possible that the cycle starts after a number of iterations larger than `b`.

To fix this, we should remove the `if len(notes) > b:` premature termination check, as the cycle detection logic is already correctly implemented through the remainders list. The script will correctly exit the loop once it encounters a repeating remainder.

Here is the revised and corrected solution:

```python
def find_theme_and_refrain(a, b):
    # Initialize variables and list to keep track of notes and remainders
    notes = []
    remainders = [-1] * b  # Create a list initialized with -1
    ref_start = 0  # The index where the refrain starts
    while True:
        note = (a * 10) // b
        a = (a * 10) % b
        if remainders[a] != -1:  # If we have seen this remainder before, we found the refrain
            ref_start = remainders[a]  # Refrain starts from the index stored in remainders list
            break
        remainders[a] = len(notes)  # Store the index of the current note for this remainder
        notes.append(note)
    
    # Theme is everything before the refrain; refrain is from ref_start to the end
    theme = notes[:ref_start]
    refrain = notes[ref_start:]
    return theme, refrain

# Read input data
with open('muzica.in', 'r') as file:
    a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find theme and refrain
theme, refrain = find_theme_and_refrain(a, b)

# Write output data
with open('muzica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(''.join(map(str, theme)) + ''.join(map(str, refrain)) + ' ' + str(len(refrain)))
```

With the flawed early termination check removed, the loop should continue until a repeating remainder is found, ensuring that the full refrain is captured. This should produce the correct output.

Upon further inspection, the issue seems to be with the handling of the remainder and the refrain detection. The current approach of using a list of remainders to store indices at which each remainder is encountered is correct. However, the error could be due to not handling the case when the remainder becomes zero, which can still be valid for refrain detection.

In the case of a remainder of zero, we should still record it as a note and update the `remainders` list accordingly. This is because a remainder of zero is a valid part of the sequence and can be part of the refrain. The exit condition of the loop should only be when we encounter a remainder that we've seen before, which indicates the start of the refrain.

Let's correct the solution to ensure that all remainders, including zero, are handled correctly:

```python
def find_theme_and_refrain(a, b):
    # Initialize variables and lists to keep track of the notes and remainders
    notes = []
    remainders = [-1] * b  # Create a list initialized with -1 to track if we've seen a remainder before
    ref_start = -1  # Initialize the refrain start index as -1 as a marker for not found
    
    while True:
        note = (a * 10) // b
        a = (a * 10) % b
        notes.append(note)  # Add the note before checking for refrain
        if remainders[a] != -1:  # If we have seen this remainder before, we found the refrain
            ref_start = remainders[a]  # Refrain starts from the index stored in remainders list
            break
        if a == 0:  # If the remainder is zero, the refrain is the entire sequence
            ref_start = 0
            break
        remainders[a] = len(notes) - 1  # Store the index of the current note for this remainder

    # Theme is everything before the refrain; refrain is from ref_start to the end
    theme = notes[:ref_start]
    refrain = notes[ref_start:]
    return theme, refrain

# Read input data
with open('muzica.in', 'r') as file:
    a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find theme and refrain
theme, refrain = find_theme_and_refrain(a, b)

# Write output data
with open('muzica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(''.join(map(str, theme)) + ''.join(map(str, refrain)) + ' ' + str(len(refrain)))
```

This updated solution makes sure to handle the zero remainder correctly by adding the last note before the check, which ensures that we don't miss out on a valid note, and also checks for the special case when the remainder is zero to handle it properly. This should now provide the correct output.

The updated solution I provided previously is still giving incorrect output. Upon closer examination, there seems to be a miscalculation in the length of the refrain. The expected output indicates that the length of the refrain should be 34 digits, but our current solution is yielding a refrain with 35 digits.

The error seems to come from the handling of the starting index of the refrain (`ref_start`). The `remainders` list stores the note indices starting from `0`, hence the index stored should directly correspond to the position at which the note occurs in the `notes` list.

When we detect a repeating remainder, we should use the stored index directly without subtracting `1` to determine the starting position of the refrain. Also, when we update the `remainders` list with a new index, we should simply store the current length of the `notes` list, which is the correct next index for a new note.

Let's correct the solution to accurately calculate the starting index of the refrain:

```python
def find_theme_and_refrain(a, b):
    # Initialize variables and lists to keep track of the notes and remainders
    notes = []
    remainders = [-1] * b  # Create a list initialized with -1 to track if we've seen a remainder before

    while True:
        note = (a * 10) // b
        a = (a * 10) % b
        notes.append(note)  # Add the note to the sequence
        if remainders[a] != -1:  # If we have seen this remainder before, we found the refrain
            ref_start = remainders[a]  # The index where the refrain starts is the one stored in the remainders list
            break
        remainders[a] = len(notes) - 1  # Store the index of the current note for this remainder

    # Theme is everything before the refrain; refrain is from ref_start to the end
    theme = notes[:ref_start]
    refrain = notes[ref_start:]
    return theme, refrain

# Read input data
with open('muzica.in', 'r') as file:
    a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find theme and refrain
theme, refrain = find_theme_and_refrain(a, b)

# Write output data
with open('muzica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(''.join(map(str, theme)) + ''.join(map(str, refrain)) + ' ' + str(len(refrain)))
```

This corrected solution should now properly split the sequence into the theme and refrain and output the correct number of refrain digits. Let's run this code with the given input to verify the fix.

I apologize for the oversight. It appears that the detection of the refrain's start index is still not correct. To ensure the correct detection of the refrain, we need to store the index at which each remainder was first encountered, and when we encounter the same remainder again, that's where the refrain starts.

The discrepancy in the expected and found output is that the refrain length is calculated as one more than it should be. This suggests that when detecting the start of the refrain, the implementation is including one additional digit that should actually be part of the theme. This can happen if we append the note to `notes` before checking if the current `a` (remainder) has been encountered before.

To address this, we must check for a repeating remainder before appending the current note to `notes`. If the remainder has been encountered, we mark the start of the refrain and exit the loop. Otherwise, we append the note and continue.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def find_theme_and_refrain(a, b):
    # Initialize variables and lists to keep track of the notes and remainders
    notes = []
    remainders = [-1] * b  # Create a list initialized with -1 to track if we've seen a remainder before

    while True:
        note = (a * 10) // b
        new_a = (a * 10) % b  # Calculate the new remainder

        if remainders[new_a] != -1:  # If we have seen this remainder before, we found the refrain
            ref_start = remainders[new_a]  # The index where the refrain starts
            notes.append(note)  # Append the current note as part of the refrain
            break

        remainders[new_a] = len(notes)  # Store the index of the current note for this new remainder
        notes.append(note)  # Append the note to the sequence after checking for refrain
        a = new_a  # Update the remainder

    # Theme is everything before the refrain; refrain is from ref_start to the end
    theme = notes[:ref_start]
    refrain = notes[ref_start:]
    return theme, refrain

# Read input data
with open('muzica.in', 'r') as file:
    a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find theme and refrain
theme, refrain = find_theme_and_refrain(a, b)

# Write output data
with open('muzica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(''.join(map(str, theme)) + ''.join(map(str, refrain)) + ' ' + str(len(refrain)))
```

This solution ensures that the note is appended after refrain detection, which should provide the correct refrain length in the output.

The issue seems to persist due to the refrain being one digit longer than expected. This may suggest that the detection of the refrain's start is including the first note of the refrain twice: once as the last note of the theme and once as the first note of the refrain. To correct this, we need to ensure that the refrain starts with the note generated after we encounter a previously seen remainder.

To fix this, we will only append the note to the `notes` list after we update the `remainders` list. If we hit a remainder that we've seen before, we do not append the current note to the list but break out of the loop. This ensures that the first repeating note is recognized as the start of the refrain, not the end of the theme.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def find_theme_and_refrain(a, b):
    # Initialize variables and list to keep track of notes and remainders
    notes = []
    remainders = [-1] * b  # Create a list initialized with -1 to track if we've seen a remainder before

    while True:
        note = (a * 10) // b
        a = (a * 10) % b
        if remainders[a] != -1:  # If we have seen this remainder before, we found the refrain
            ref_start = remainders[a]  # The index where the refrain starts
            break
        else:
            remainders[a] = len(notes)  # Store the index of the current note for this remainder
            notes.append(note)  # Append the note to the sequence after checking for refrain

    # Theme is everything before the refrain; refrain is from ref_start to the end
    theme = notes[:ref_start]
    refrain = notes[ref_start:]
    return theme, refrain

# Read input data
with open('muzica.in', 'r') as file:
    a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find theme and refrain
theme, refrain = find_theme_and_refrain(a, b)

# Write output data
with open('muzica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(''.join(map(str, theme)) + ''.join(map(str, refrain)) + ' ' + str(len(refrain)))
```

This updated solution should correctly identify the theme and refrain without double-counting the first note of the refrain. Let's run this code with the given input to verify the fix.
