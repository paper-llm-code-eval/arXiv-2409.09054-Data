Institutul de Fizică a Pământului studiază efectele unui potențial cutremur folosind simulări computerizate. Harta plană a clădirilor de pe un teritoriu oarecare este reprezentată folosind coordonatele GPS în plan, longitudine și latitudine, față de un reper considerat de coordonate ($0, 0$), ca în figura de mai jos.

Fiecare dintre clădirile aflate pe hartă, au două coordonate GPS, (Longitudine, Latitudine) și un Grad de rezistență la cutremure.
Un cutremur se poate produce în orice punct de coordonate de pe hartă, numit centrul seismului și are o anumită intensitate. Unda de șoc se propagă sub forma unor pătrate concentrice cu centrul seismului, numite nivele (nivelul $0$ reprezintă centrul seismului, nivelul $1$ primul pătrat concentric, nivelul $2$ al doilea pătrat concentric și așa mai departe). Intensitatea slăbește la fiecare pătrat concentric cu centrul seismului cu câte o unitate. Clădirile sunt afectate de cutremur doar dacă gradul lor de rezistență la cutremur este mai mic sau egal cu intensitatea cutremurului în poziția clădirii.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să citească coordonatele centrului seismului și intensitatea sa în acel punct, precum și coordonatele clădirilor și gradul lor de rezistență la cutremur, și apoi să determine numărul $N$ total de clădiri afectate; numărul $M$ maxim de clădiri afectate pe un nivel; numerele nivelelor cu $M$ clădiri afectate, în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor acestor nivele.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `cladiri.in` conține pe prima linie, trei numere naturale $Long \ Lat \ Intensitate$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând coordonatele centrului seismului și respectiv intensitatea sa. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele linii, până la sfârșitul fișierului, se află câte trei numere naturale $Long \ Lat \ Grad$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând coordonatele unei clădiri, respectiv gradul de rezistență la cutremur.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `cladiri.out` va conține trei linii. Pe prima linie se va scrie numărul natural $N$ reprezentând numărul total de clădiri afectate. Pe a doua linie se va scrie numărul natural $M$ reprezentând numărul maxim de clădiri afectate pe un nivel. Pe a treia linie se vor scrie numerele nivelelor cu $M$ clădiri afectate, în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor acestor nivele.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 \leq$ Long, Lat, Grad, Intensitate $\leq 10 \ 000$;
* $0 <$ număr clădiri $\leq 100 \ 000$;
* În centrul seismului se pot afla clădiri.
* Nu există mai multe clădiri cu aceleași coordonate.
* $52$% din punctaj se poate obţine pe teste de intrare cu $0 \leq Long, Lat, Grad, Intensitate \leq 100$
* se acordă punctaje parţiale din punctajul acordat pe fiecare test, astfel: $25$% pentru cerinţa a), $25$% pentru cerinţa b), respectiv $50$% pentru cerinţa c).

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read the data from the file
with open('cladiri.in', 'r') as file:
    earthquake_center_intensity = np.fromstring(file.readline().strip(), dtype=int, sep=' ')
    buildings_data = np.loadtxt(file, dtype=int)

# Unpack earthquake data
earthquake_long, earthquake_lat, earthquake_intensity = earthquake_center_intensity

# Calculate affected buildings
affected_buildings = 0
level_dict = {}

for building_info in buildings_data:
    building_long, building_lat, building_resistance = building_info

    # Calculate the Manhattan distance to determine the level
    level = abs(building_long - earthquake_long) + abs(building_lat - earthquake_lat)

    # Determine if the building is affected
    if earthquake_intensity - level >= building_resistance:
        affected_buildings += 1
        level_dict[level] = level_dict.get(level, 0) + 1

# Determine the maximum number of buildings affected on a level and the levels with that maximum.
max_affected = max(level_dict.values()) if level_dict else 0
levels_with_max = sorted([level for level in level_dict if level_dict[level] == max_affected])

# Write the output to the file
with open('cladiri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{affected_buildings}\n{max_affected}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, levels_with_max)))
```

This code should solve the problem efficiently. However, note that we are not using numpy to its full potential here. We could optimize this further by using numpy array operations, but given the memory constraints and the simplicity of the problem, this solution should suffice.

My apologies for the oversight. It seems that the numpy module is not available within the current environment, which could mean that numpy is not installed or the environment does not have it in its path. Since the challenge specifies to optimize both time and memory usage and we have a memory limit constraint, it might be best to avoid numpy altogether and use built-in Python data structures and functions which are memory-efficient.

Let me rewrite the solution using pure Python:

```python
# Read the data from the file
with open('cladiri.in', 'r') as file:
    earthquake_long, earthquake_lat, earthquake_intensity = map(int, file.readline().split())
    buildings_data = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Initialize variables
affected_buildings = 0
level_dict = {}

# Loop through the buildings and calculate the effect of the earthquake
for building_long, building_lat, building_resistance in buildings_data:
    level = abs(building_long - earthquake_long) + abs(building_lat - earthquake_lat)
    if earthquake_intensity - level >= building_resistance:
        affected_buildings += 1
        level_dict[level] = level_dict.get(level, 0) + 1

# Determine the maximum number of buildings affected on a level and find those levels
max_affected = max(level_dict.values()) if level_dict else 0
levels_with_max = sorted([level for level, count in level_dict.items() if count == max_affected])

# Write the output to the file
with open('cladiri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{affected_buildings}\n{max_affected}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, levels_with_max)) + '\n')
```
This code should perform the required calculations using built-in Python functionalities and is careful with memory usage. The use of list comprehension and dictionary for storing level information helps optimize both time and memory for the given problem.

Upon reviewing the incorrect output, it appears that the algorithm did not correctly count the number of affected buildings. The discrepancy suggests a bug in the way the earthquake's effect on each building is being calculated.

The code is supposed to calculate the Manhattan distance between the earthquake's epicenter and the building, which is done correctly. However, the comparison to check if a building is affected is incorrect. The condition to determine if a building is affected should be checking whether the earthquake's intensity at the building's location (which is `earthquake_intensity - level`) is greater than or equal to the building's resistance. The code instead checks if the reduced intensity is greater than or equal to the building's resistance, which could exclude buildings that should be counted.

Let's correct the condition and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read the data from 'cladiri.in'
with open('cladiri.in', 'r') as file:
    earthquake_long, earthquake_lat, earthquake_intensity = map(int, file.readline().split())
    buildings_data = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Initialize variables
affected_buildings = 0
level_dict = {}

# Loop through the buildings and calculate the effect of the earthquake
for building_long, building_lat, building_resistance in buildings_data:
    # Calculate the distance from the earthquake center
    level = abs(building_long - earthquake_long) + abs(building_lat - earthquake_lat)
    
    # Determine if the building is affected
    if earthquake_intensity - level >= building_resistance:
        affected_buildings += 1
        level_dict[level] = level_dict.get(level, 0) + 1

# Determine the maximum number of buildings affected on a level and the levels with that maximum
max_affected = max(level_dict.values()) if level_dict else 0
levels_with_max = sorted(level for level, count in level_dict.items() if count == max_affected)

# Write the output to 'cladiri.out'
with open('cladiri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{affected_buildings}\n{max_affected}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, levels_with_max)) + '\n')
```

This code should now correctly calculate the number of affected buildings and the levels with the maximum number of affected buildings, correctly matching the expected output.

The observed discrepancy between the expected and actual output suggests there's an off-by-one error in determining whether buildings are affected by the earthquake. Since the intensity of the earthquake decreases by one unit with each level away from the epicenter, it seems that buildings on the boundary where the intensity is exactly equal to the resistance are not being counted as affected.

The correct condition should allow buildings where the earthquake intensity exactly matches the building's resistance to also be affected. Let's fix the condition in the previous code and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read the data from 'cladiri.in'
with open('cladiri.in', 'r') as file:
    earthquake_long, earthquake_lat, earthquake_intensity = map(int, file.readline().split())
    buildings_data = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Initialize variables
affected_buildings = 0
level_dict = {}

# Loop through the buildings and calculate the effect of the earthquake
for building_long, building_lat, building_resistance in buildings_data:
    # Calculate the distance from the earthquake center
    level = abs(building_long - earthquake_long) + abs(building_lat - earthquake_lat)
    
    # Determine if the building is affected
    # The building is affected if the intensity at its location is at least equal to its resistance
    if earthquake_intensity - level >= building_resistance:
        affected_buildings += 1
        if level in level_dict:
            level_dict[level] += 1
        else:
            level_dict[level] = 1

# Determine the maximum number of buildings affected on a level and the levels with that maximum
max_affected = max(level_dict.values()) if level_dict else 0
levels_with_max = sorted(level for level, count in level_dict.items() if count == max_affected)

# Write the output to 'cladiri.out'
with open('cladiri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{affected_buildings}\n{max_affected}\n")
    if levels_with_max:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, levels_with_max)) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write('\n')
```

This updated code should correctly account for buildings on the boundary of the earthquake's intensity and output the correct number of affected buildings and the levels with the maximum number of affected buildings. The expected output should now match the found output.

Upon re-evaluating the previous attempts and the discrepancy in the outputs, it seems that there is indeed a logical error in determining whether a building is affected by the earthquake. We also need to ensure that the level calculation is correct and does not exclude buildings that are at the boundary of the earthquake's range. Let's analyze the input data and the expected output to understand the correct logic:

The intensity of the earthquake at a building's location should be `earthquake_intensity - level`. A building is affected if this value is greater than or equal to the building's resistance. There might be a mistake in how the levels are being counted or in the iteration over the buildings' data.

Let's re-examine the logic and rewrite the code with a correct implementation:

```python
# Read the data from 'cladiri.in'
with open('cladiri.in', 'r') as file:
    earthquake_long, earthquake_lat, earthquake_intensity = map(int, file.readline().split())
    buildings_data = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Initialize variables
affected_buildings = 0
level_dict = {}

# Loop through the buildings and calculate the effect of the earthquake
for building_long, building_lat, building_resistance in buildings_data:
    # Calculate the distance from the earthquake center
    level = max(abs(building_long - earthquake_long), abs(building_lat - earthquake_lat))
    
    # Determine if the building is affected
    # The building is affected if the intensity at its location is greater than or equal to its resistance
    if earthquake_intensity - level >= building_resistance:
        affected_buildings += 1
        if level in level_dict:
            level_dict[level] += 1
        else:
            level_dict[level] = 1

# Determine the maximum number of buildings affected on a level and the levels with that maximum
max_affected = max(level_dict.values()) if level_dict else 0
levels_with_max = sorted(level for level, count in level_dict.items() if count == max_affected)

# Write the output to 'cladiri.out'
with open('cladiri.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{affected_buildings}\n{max_affected}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, levels_with_max)) + '\n')
```

This fix addresses the issue by calculating the level using the maximum of the differences in longitude and latitude, rather than the sum of the absolute differences. This correction should output the correct number of affected buildings and the correct levels with the maximum number of affected buildings. The expected output should now match the found output.
