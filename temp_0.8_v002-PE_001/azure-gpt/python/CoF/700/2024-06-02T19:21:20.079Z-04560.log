Un experiment urmărește comportarea unui șoricel pus într-o cutie dreptunghiulară, împărțită în $m \times n$ cămăruțe egale de formă pătrată. Fiecare cămăruță conține o anumită cantitate de hrană. Șoricelul trebuie să pornească din colțul $(1,1)$ al cutiei și să ajungă în colțul opus, mâncând cât mai multă hrană. El poate trece dintr-o cameră în una alăturată (două camere sunt alăturate dacă au un perete comun), mănâncă toată hrana din cămăruță atunci când intră și nu intră niciodată într-o cameră în care a mai intrat înainte. 

# Cerință

Stabiliți care este cantitatea maximă de hrană pe care o poate mânca și traseul pe care îl poate urma pentru a culege această cantitate maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mouse.in` conține pe prima linie două numere $m$ și $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii respectiv numărul de coloane ale cutiei, iar pe următoarele $m$ linii cele $m \cdot n$ numere reprezentând cantitatea de hrană existentă în fiecare cămăruță, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `mouse.out` se vor scrie pe prima linie două numere separate printr-un spațiu: numărul de cămăruțe vizitate și cantitatea de hrană maximă culeasă. Pe următoarele linii se va scrie un traseu posibil pentru cantitatea dată, sub formă de perechi de numere, începând cu $(1, 1)$ și terminând cu $(m, n)$.

# Restricții și precizări
- Toate valorile din fișier sunt numere naturale între $1$ și $100$.
- Veți primi 40 de puncte pentru afișarea primelor două numere.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read the grid dimensions and food quantities from the input file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    food = np.array([list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)], dtype=np.int32)

# Initialize the matrix for maximum food quantity collected up to each cell
max_food = np.zeros((m + 1, n + 1), dtype=np.int32)

# Process the matrix to find the maximum possible food collected for each cell
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        max_food[i, j] = food[i - 1, j - 1] + max(max_food[i - 1, j], max_food[i, j - 1])

# Reconstruct the path by backtracking from the bottom-right corner
path = []
x, y = m, n
while x > 0 and y > 0:
    path.append((x, y))
    if max_food[x - 1, y] > max_food[x, y - 1]:
        x -= 1
    else:
        y -= 1

# The path is constructed from end to start, so we need to reverse it
path.reverse()

# Write the number of rooms visited and the maximum amount of food to the output file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(path)} {max_food[m, n]}\n")
    for room in path:
        file.write(f"{room[0]} {room[1]}\n")
```

Please ensure that the files 'mouse.in' and 'mouse.out' are in the same directory as the script for it to read and write the files correctly. Also, note that this solution uses numpy, which is a highly efficient library for numerical computations in Python, and it is particularly useful when dealing with arrays and matrices. The memory usage is optimized by using `np.int32` for the data types, which should be sufficient for the input range and help to keep within the 8MB limit.

It appears that the `numpy` library is not installed in the environment where the script is being executed, which is why the `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised. Given the requirement of optimizing for memory usage and the memory limit of ~8MB, we can use Python's standard libraries, which should be more than enough to handle the problem efficiently.

Here is the revised solution without `numpy`:

```python
# Define a function to read the input file and return the grid and its dimensions
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    return m, n, grid

# Define a function to find the maximum food and path
def find_max_food(m, n, grid):
    # Create a DP table to store the maximum food to reach each cell
    max_food = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            max_food[i][j] = grid[i - 1][j - 1] + max(max_food[i - 1][j], max_food[i][j - 1])
    
    # Backtrack to find the path
    path = []
    x, y = m, n
    while x > 0 and y > 0:
        path.append((x, y))
        if max_food[x - 1][y] > max_food[x][y - 1]:
            x -= 1
        else:
            y -= 1
    
    # Reverse the path to start from (1, 1)
    path.reverse()
    
    # Return the number of rooms visited and the maximum food collected
    return len(path), max_food[m][n], path

# Define a function to write the output to the file
def write_output(file_path, num_rooms, max_food, path):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_rooms} {max_food}\n")
        for room in path:
            file.write(f"{room[0]} {room[1]}\n")

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    m, n, grid = read_input('mouse.in')
    num_rooms, max_food, path = find_max_food(m, n, grid)
    write_output('mouse.out', num_rooms, max_food, path)
```

The solution now uses basic lists to represent the grid and dynamic programming table, which should be sufficient for the problem constraints and is more memory efficient than using `numpy`. We read from 'mouse.in' and write the result to 'mouse.out', following the specifications given. This version should be both time and memory efficient without relying on external libraries.

Upon examining the difference between the expected output and the found output, it is clear that the current approach is not considering all possible paths. The issue lies in the decision-making process when backtracking the path: it only considers the immediate previous cells in the last row and column, instead of considering possible moves from both up and left.

The backtracking should check both the cell directly above and the cell to the left, to reconstruct the correct path that led to the maximum amount of food. However, the current approach only allows moving either up or to the left at each step, which may not reconstruct the path accurately.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the choices made at each step when filling the dynamic programming table. This way, we can backtrack the correct path accurately.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    food = [[int(x) for x in file.readline().split()] for _ in range(m)]

# Create a DP matrix with an extra row and column for convenience
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

# Fill the DP matrix with the maximum food collected to each cell
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][j] = food[i - 1][j - 1] + max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

# Backtrack to find the path
path = []
x, y = m, n
while x != 1 or y != 1:
    path.append((x, y))
    if x == 1:
        y -= 1
    elif y == 1:
        x -= 1
    elif dp[x-1][y] > dp[x][y-1]: # If the cell above has a greater value, move up
        x -= 1
    else:                           # Otherwise, move left
        y -= 1
path.append((1, 1))  # Add the starting cell
path.reverse()       # Reverse the path to get the correct order

# Write the output data
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(path)} {dp[m][n]}\n")
    for x, y in path:
        file.write(f"{x} {y}\n")
```

This new solution ensures that we are backtracking the path correctly from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner by considering the path that led to the maximum food collected. The path is appended starting from the bottom-right corner and is later reversed to start from the top-left corner (1, 1). This solution should now produce the correct output as expected.

The issue with the current solution is that it only allows the mouse to move either down or right at each step, which is a limitation that does not fulfill the requirement of the problem. The problem allows the mouse to move to any adjacent room that has not been visited before, which includes moving up and left as well. This requires a more complex approach to track the path taken to reach the maximum quantity of food.

We need to apply a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with backtracking to explore all possible paths that the mouse can take and keep track of the maximum food collected. For each path, we'll compare the food collected and update the maximum food and corresponding path as needed.

Here is the corrected solution that implements DFS with backtracking:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    food = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum food and the corresponding path
max_food = 0
max_path = []

# Define a recursive function to perform DFS and update the maximum food and path
def dfs(x, y, visited, current_food, current_path):
    global max_food, max_path

    # Add the current room's food to the total and mark the room as visited
    current_food += food[x][y]
    visited[x][y] = True
    current_path.append((x + 1, y + 1))  # Store 1-based indices

    # Update the maximum food and path if the current one is better
    if (x, y) == (m - 1, n - 1) and current_food > max_food:
        max_food = current_food
        max_path = current_path.copy()

    # Explore all adjacent rooms (down, right, up, left)
    for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
            dfs(nx, ny, visited, current_food, current_path)
    
    # Backtrack: unmark the room as visited and remove it from the current path
    visited[x][y] = False
    current_path.pop()

# Initialize the visited matrix and start DFS from the top-left room
visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
dfs(0, 0, visited, 0, [])

# Write the output data
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(max_path)} {max_food}\n")
    for x, y in max_path:
        file.write(f"{x} {y}\n")
```

This new solution uses DFS to explore all possible paths while keeping within the constraints of the problem, and it should produce the correct output with the maximum food collected and the path taken by the mouse. The use of backtracking ensures that we do not visit the same room twice.
