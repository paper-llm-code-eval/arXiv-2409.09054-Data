Un experiment urmărește comportarea unui șoricel pus într-o cutie dreptunghiulară, împărțită în $m \times n$ cămăruțe egale de formă pătrată. Fiecare cămăruță conține o anumită cantitate de hrană. Șoricelul trebuie să pornească din colțul $(1,1)$ al cutiei și să ajungă în colțul opus, mâncând cât mai multă hrană. El poate trece dintr-o cameră în una alăturată (două camere sunt alăturate dacă au un perete comun), mănâncă toată hrana din cămăruță atunci când intră și nu intră niciodată într-o cameră în care a mai intrat înainte. 

# Cerință

Stabiliți care este cantitatea maximă de hrană pe care o poate mânca și traseul pe care îl poate urma pentru a culege această cantitate maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mouse.in` conține pe prima linie două numere $m$ și $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii respectiv numărul de coloane ale cutiei, iar pe următoarele $m$ linii cele $m \cdot n$ numere reprezentând cantitatea de hrană existentă în fiecare cămăruță, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `mouse.out` se vor scrie pe prima linie două numere separate printr-un spațiu: numărul de cămăruțe vizitate și cantitatea de hrană maximă culeasă. Pe următoarele linii se va scrie un traseu posibil pentru cantitatea dată, sub formă de perechi de numere, începând cu $(1, 1)$ și terminând cu $(m, n)$.

# Restricții și precizări
- Toate valorile din fișier sunt numere naturale între $1$ și $100$.
- Veți primi 40 de puncte pentru afișarea primelor două numere.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = np.array([list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f], dtype=np.int32)

# Initialize the matrix to store the maximum food that can be collected
dp = np.zeros((m+1, n+1), dtype=np.int32)

# Initialize the matrix to store the path
path = np.full((m+1, n+1), (-1, -1), dtype=[('x', np.int32), ('y', np.int32)])

# Bottom-up DP to calculate the maximum food that can be collected
for i in range(1, m+1):
    for j in range(1, n+1):
        if dp[i-1, j] > dp[i, j-1]:  # Coming from above
            dp[i, j] = dp[i-1, j] + grid[i-1, j-1]
            path[i, j] = (i-1, j)
        else:  # Coming from the left
            dp[i, j] = dp[i, j-1] + grid[i-1, j-1]
            path[i, j] = (i, j-1)

# Backtrack to find the path
max_food = dp[m, n]
room_count = 0
trace_path = []
x, y = m, n
while (x, y) != (1, 1):
    trace_path.append((x, y))
    room_count += 1
    x, y = path[x, y]
trace_path.append((1, 1))  # Add the starting position
trace_path.reverse()  # Reverse to get the path from start to end

# Write the output file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{room_count+1} {max_food}\n")
    for (x, y) in trace_path:
        f.write(f"{x} {y}\n")
```

This solution initializes a dynamic programming matrix (`dp`) to keep track of the maximum food that can be collected up to each cell. It also initializes a path matrix (`path`) to remember the previous cell for each cell's optimal path. It fills these matrices in a bottom-up manner, starting from the starting cell `(1, 1)`. After calculating the maximum food, it backtracks from the destination cell `(m, n)` to find the actual path taken.

The complexity of this program is $O(m \times n)$, and it uses numpy to optimize array operations. The matrices `dp` and `path` make sure that the memory usage stays within the limit. The input and output are handled using file operations, respecting the problem constraints.

Based on the error message indicating `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`, it appears that the numpy library is not installed in the current environment where the code is being executed. Since the numpy library is crucial for optimizing memory and processing for this challenge, you would typically install it using `pip install numpy` before running the program. However, if we are in an environment where we cannot install new modules, we will have to rewrite the solution without using numpy or any other third-party libraries.

Here's the solution using only built-in Python functionality:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize the matrix to store the maximum food that can be collected
dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]

# Bottom-up DP to calculate the maximum food that can be collected
for i in range(1, m+1):
    for j in range(1, n+1):
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i-1][j-1]

# Backtrack to find the path
max_food = dp[m][n]
room_count = 0
trace_path = []
x, y = m, n
while x != 1 or y != 1:
    trace_path.append((x, y))
    room_count += 1
    if dp[x-1][y] > dp[x][y-1]:
        x -= 1
    else:
        y -= 1
trace_path.append((1, 1))  # Add the starting position
trace_path.reverse()  # Reverse to get the path from start to end

# Write the output file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{room_count+1} {max_food}\n")
    for x, y in trace_path:
        f.write(f"{x} {y}\n")
```

This code achieves the same as the previous numpy version but uses lists to create a matrix and standard Python library functions for file I/O operations. The complexity remains $O(m \times n)$, which is the most efficient for this problem, and the memory usage should still be within the specified limit since we are only using two-dimensional lists to store the necessary data, and we are careful with our memory allocation.

The provided solution does not consider the possibility of moving downwards, as it only chooses the path based on the maximum of either coming from the left or from above. This prevents the mouse from exploring potentially more rewarding paths that involve moving downwards. To fix this issue, we need to implement a solution that properly accounts for moving both rightward and downward while keeping track of the maximum food collected and the corresponding path.

To correct the problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to explore all possible paths and choose the one with the maximum food. Due to the memory constraints, we will use iterative dynamic programming to reduce memory usage and avoid stack overflow that could occur with a recursive approach.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize the matrix to store the maximum food that can be collected
dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]

# Calculate the maximum food from the top and left
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        if i > 0:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j])
        if j > 0:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j])

# Backtrack to find the path
path = []
x, y = m - 1, n - 1
while x != 0 or y != 0:
    path.append((x + 1, y + 1))  # Use 1-based indexing for the output
    if x > 0 and dp[x][y] == dp[x-1][y] + grid[x][y]:
        x -= 1
    else:
        y -= 1
path.append((1, 1))  # Add the starting position
path.reverse()  # Reverse to get the path from start to end

# Write the output file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{len(path)} {dp[m-1][n-1]}\n")
    for x, y in path:
        f.write(f"{x} {y}\n")
```

This updated solution initializes the `dp` matrix in such a way that it accounts for the possibility of the mouse moving in both rightward and downward directions. It first calculates the maximum food collected up to each cell by considering the maximum food collected from the cell above and to the left. Then, it uses backtracking from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner to determine the path taken to maximize the food collected. The solution still adheres to the memory constraints and ensures that the mouse can explore all viable paths within the grid.

The differences between the expected and found output indicate that the algorithm is still not considering all possible paths. It is clear from the expected output that the mouse is allowed to move not only right and down but also up, as long as it does not visit the same cell twice. The previous solution only allowed for right and downward movements, which is why it failed to find the optimal path.

To fix this, we need to implement a solution that allows for the mouse to move up, down, right, and left (excluding the cells it has already visited). A depth-first search (DFS) could be used to explore all possible paths, but this could potentially be very expensive in terms of both time and memory.

Given the memory constraints, we should aim for an iterative dynamic programming approach that takes into account all possible movements while being memory efficient. We will use a `visited` array to ensure we do not revisit cells and a stack to perform the DFS iteratively.

Here's the corrected solution with iterative DFS and backtracking to find the maximum food path:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize the path and visited matrix
path, max_path = [(1, 1)], []
visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
visited[0][0] = True

# DFS variables
max_food = 0
stack = [(0, 0, 1, grid[0][0], path, visited)]

# DFS iteration
while stack:
    x, y, count, food, path, visited = stack.pop()

    # Update max food and path
    if (x, y) == (m - 1, n - 1):
        if food > max_food:
            max_food = food
            max_path = path.copy()
        continue

    # Explore all possible directions
    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
            visited[nx][ny] = True
            stack.append((nx, ny, count + 1, food + grid[nx][ny], path + [(nx + 1, ny + 1)], visited))
            visited[nx][ny] = False  # Backtrack

# Write the output file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{len(max_path)} {max_food}\n")
    for x, y in max_path:
        f.write(f"{x} {y}\n")
```

This solution performs a depth-first search to explore paths and uses a `visited` matrix to ensure cells are not revisited. The DFS is done iteratively with a stack to avoid recursion depth issues, and we use backtracking to unmark visited cells. The path and the maximum amount of food are updated whenever the bottom-right cell is reached. This approach should correctly find the path that allows the mouse to collect the maximum amount of food.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed by the operating system, often due to it using too much memory or taking too long to execute. In the context of this problem, it's likely that the DFS implementation is causing a stack overflow due to too many recursive calls or excessive memory usage.

Since the problem has strict memory limits (~8MB), we need to optimize our approach. A full DFS considering all possible paths is not feasible due to the memory limitations. Instead, we need an approach that is more memory-efficient.

One way to optimize memory usage is to use backtracking with a single path array that gets updated as we explore the grid, rather than storing multiple path copies for each recursive call. We should also ensure that we don't add unnecessary data to the stack.

Here is a solution that uses backtracking with a single mutable path and a visited set to keep track of visited coordinates:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize variables for tracking the maximum food and path
max_food = 0
max_path = []

# Recursive function for backtracking
def backtrack(x, y, food_collected, path):
    global max_food, max_path

    # If the bottom-right corner is reached, update max_food and max_path
    if (x, y) == (m - 1, n - 1):
        if food_collected > max_food:
            max_food = food_collected
            max_path = path.copy()
        return

    # Explore all four possible directions
    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in path:
            path.add((nx, ny))
            backtrack(nx, ny, food_collected + grid[nx][ny], path)
            path.remove((nx, ny))  # Backtrack

# Start the backtracking from the top-left corner
backtrack(0, 0, grid[0][0], {(0, 0)})

# Convert the max_path to 1-based index and write the output file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{len(max_path)} {max_food}\n")
    for x, y in max_path:
        f.write(f"{x + 1} {y + 1}\n")
```

This solution uses backtracking to avoid unnecessary memory usage. The path is stored as a set of visited coordinates, which is a mutable structure that gets updated during exploration rather than creating multiple copies. This should keep the memory usage within the limits, and the solution should find the path that maximizes the amount of food collected by the mouse.
