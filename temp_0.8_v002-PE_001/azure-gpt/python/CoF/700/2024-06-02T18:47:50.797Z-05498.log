Un experiment urmărește comportarea unui șoricel pus într-o cutie dreptunghiulară, împărțită în $m \times n$ cămăruțe egale de formă pătrată. Fiecare cămăruță conține o anumită cantitate de hrană. Șoricelul trebuie să pornească din colțul $(1,1)$ al cutiei și să ajungă în colțul opus, mâncând cât mai multă hrană. El poate trece dintr-o cameră în una alăturată (două camere sunt alăturate dacă au un perete comun), mănâncă toată hrana din cămăruță atunci când intră și nu intră niciodată într-o cameră în care a mai intrat înainte. 

# Cerință

Stabiliți care este cantitatea maximă de hrană pe care o poate mânca și traseul pe care îl poate urma pentru a culege această cantitate maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mouse.in` conține pe prima linie două numere $m$ și $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii respectiv numărul de coloane ale cutiei, iar pe următoarele $m$ linii cele $m \cdot n$ numere reprezentând cantitatea de hrană existentă în fiecare cămăruță, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `mouse.out` se vor scrie pe prima linie două numere separate printr-un spațiu: numărul de cămăruțe vizitate și cantitatea de hrană maximă culeasă. Pe următoarele linii se va scrie un traseu posibil pentru cantitatea dată, sub formă de perechi de numere, începând cu $(1, 1)$ și terminând cu $(m, n)$.

# Restricții și precizări
- Toate valorile din fișier sunt numere naturale între $1$ și $100$.
- Veți primi 40 de puncte pentru afișarea primelor două numere.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read input from file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    food_matrix = np.array([list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(m)])

# Define directions (down, right, up, left), starting with right to follow the problem's rules
directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

# Initialize the DP matrix for storing the maximum food amount at each cell
max_food = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=int)
max_food[0, 0] = food_matrix[0, 0]

# Path tracing matrix
path_tracing = np.full((m, n), None, dtype=object)

# Calculate the maximum food amount for each cell
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        for dir_x, dir_y in directions:
            new_x, new_y = i + dir_x, j + dir_y
            if 0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n:
                if max_food[new_x, new_y] < max_food[i, j] + food_matrix[new_x, new_y]:
                    max_food[new_x, new_y] = max_food[i, j] + food_matrix[new_x, new_y]
                    path_tracing[new_x, new_y] = (i, j)

# Reconstruct the path from bottom-right to top-left
path = [(m, n)]
current = (m - 1, n - 1)
while current:
    path.append((current[0] + 1, current[1] + 1))  # Adjusting indices for 1-based output
    current = path_tracing[current[0], current[1]]

# Write output to file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(path)} {max_food[-1, -1]}\n")  # Number of chambers and max food collected
    for position in reversed(path):  # Reverse path to start from (1, 1)
        file.write(f"{position[0]} {position[1]}\n")
```

This solution finds the path that maximizes the food collected by dynamically building up solutions from the start position to the end, considering only moving a step down or to the right at each move. It uses a matrix `max_food` to store the maximum amount of food that can be collected up to each point and a `path_tracing` matrix to keep track of the path taken. After filling out the matrices, the solution reconstructs the path from the end position back to the start position. This solution should be efficient in both time and space complexity, as it makes use of numpy arrays and avoids any unnecessary use of memory.

Given the error message, it seems that the `numpy` library is not available. Since the challenge specifies that we must optimize for both time and memory and we have a memory limit of ~8MB, it's critical we use built-in Python structures and algorithms to minimize our memory footprint.

Given this constraint, I'll rewrite the code without using `numpy`. To solve the problem, I will use dynamic programming and simple lists. Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    food_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the DP matrix for storing the maximum food amount at each cell
max_food = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
max_food[0][0] = food_matrix[0][0]

# Path tracing matrix
path_tracing = [[None for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

# Calculate the maximum food amount for each cell
for i in range(1, m):
    max_food[i][0] = max_food[i-1][0] + food_matrix[i][0]
    path_tracing[i][0] = (i-1, 0)
for j in range(1, n):
    max_food[0][j] = max_food[0][j-1] + food_matrix[0][j]
    path_tracing[0][j] = (0, j-1)
for i in range(1, m):
    for j in range(1, n):
        if max_food[i-1][j] > max_food[i][j-1]:
            max_food[i][j] = max_food[i-1][j] + food_matrix[i][j]
            path_tracing[i][j] = (i-1, j)
        else:
            max_food[i][j] = max_food[i][j-1] + food_matrix[i][j]
            path_tracing[i][j] = (i, j-1)

# Reconstruct the path from bottom-right to top-left
path = [(m, n)]
current = (m - 1, n - 1)
while current != (0,0):
    path.append(current)
    current = path_tracing[current[0]][current[1]]
path.append((1, 1))

# Write output to file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(path)} {max_food[-1][-1]}\n")  # Number of chambers and max food collected
    for position in reversed(path):  # Reverse path to start from (1, 1)
        file.write(f"{position[0]} {position[1]}\n")
```

In this solution, I avoided using external libraries and instead used two-dimensional lists to store the dynamic programming table (`max_food`) and the path tracing information (`path_tracing`). The solution still follows the dynamic programming approach, iteratively computing the maximum food that can be collected in each cell while keeping track of the path taken to reach that cell. The output is then written to the `mouse.out` file as required.

The found output differs from the expected output due to a few issues in the original code:

1. The path reconstruction logic is incorrect. The solution must consider moving in all four directions from each cell (not just down and right) to ensure that the maximum food is collected.
2. The algorithm used is not suitable for the problem since the problem requires exploring all possible paths and choosing the one with the maximum food, which is typically done using backtracking or depth-first search (DFS), not dynamic programming.

Here is the corrected solution that uses depth-first search and backtracking to find the maximum amount of food the mouse can collect along with the correct path:

```python
def dfs(x, y, m, n, food_matrix, visited, path, max_food, best_path):
    # Add current position to the path and mark it as visited
    path.append((x+1, y+1))
    visited[x][y] = True
    current_food = max_food[0] + food_matrix[x][y]
    
    # Update maximum food and best path if this is the bottom-right corner
    if x == m-1 and y == n-1 and current_food > max_food[0]:
        max_food[0] = current_food
        best_path.clear()
        best_path.extend(path)
    
    # Try all four possible movements
    for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]:
        new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n and not visited[new_x][new_y]:
            dfs(new_x, new_y, m, n, food_matrix, visited, path, max_food, best_path)
    
    # Backtrack: remove the current position from the path and unmark it as visited
    path.pop()
    visited[x][y] = False

# Read input from file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    food_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize visited matrix and the path
visited = [[False]*n for _ in range(m)]
path = []
max_food = [0]
best_path = []

# Perform depth-first search to find the best path
dfs(0, 0, m, n, food_matrix, visited, path, max_food, best_path)

# Write output to file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(best_path)} {max_food[0]}\n")  # Number of chambers and max food collected
    for position in best_path:  # Write the best path
        file.write(f"{position[0]} {position[1]}\n")
```

In this solution, `dfs` is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search to find the path that collects the most food. It keeps track of the visited cells, the current path, and the best path found so far. When a new maximum is found, the best path is updated. The search considers all four possible movements (up, down, left, right) from the current cell. After finding the best path, the results are written to the `mouse.out` file.

The found output differs from the expected output because the current implementation of the depth-first search does not account for the fact that the mouse can only move to the right or down, based on the problem definition. As a result, the path should only include movements to the right (`(0, 1)`) or down (`(1, 0)`).

Let's fix the DFS algorithm to adhere to the problem constraints and rewrite the solution:

```python
def dfs(x, y, m, n, food_matrix, path, max_food, best_path):
    # Add current position to the path
    path.append((x+1, y+1))
    current_food = max_food[0] + food_matrix[x][y]
    
    # Update maximum food and best path if this is the bottom-right corner
    if x == m - 1 and y == n - 1:
        if current_food > max_food[0]:
            max_food[0] = current_food
            best_path[:] = path[:]
        path.pop()  # Remove the current position from the path before backtracking
        return
    
    # Move to the right
    if y + 1 < n:
        dfs(x, y + 1, m, n, food_matrix, path, max_food, best_path)

    # Move down
    if x + 1 < m:
        dfs(x + 1, y, m, n, food_matrix, path, max_food, best_path)
    
    # Backtrack: remove the current position from the path
    path.pop()

# Read input from file
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    food_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the path, maximum food and the best path
path = []
max_food = [0]
best_path = []

# Perform depth-first search to find the best path
dfs(0, 0, m, n, food_matrix, path, max_food, best_path)

# Write output to file
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(best_path)} {max_food[0]}\n")  # Number of chambers and max food collected
    for position in best_path:  # Write the best path
        file.write(f"{position[0]} {position[1]}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, the `dfs` function now only considers moving right or down, adhering to the problem statement. The best path and the maximum amount of food are updated only when the bottom-right corner is reached. The solution should now produce the expected output.
