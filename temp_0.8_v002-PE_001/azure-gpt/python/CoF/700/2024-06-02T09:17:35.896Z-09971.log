Un experiment urmărește comportarea unui șoricel pus într-o cutie dreptunghiulară, împărțită în $m \times n$ cămăruțe egale de formă pătrată. Fiecare cămăruță conține o anumită cantitate de hrană. Șoricelul trebuie să pornească din colțul $(1,1)$ al cutiei și să ajungă în colțul opus, mâncând cât mai multă hrană. El poate trece dintr-o cameră în una alăturată (două camere sunt alăturate dacă au un perete comun), mănâncă toată hrana din cămăruță atunci când intră și nu intră niciodată într-o cameră în care a mai intrat înainte. 

# Cerință

Stabiliți care este cantitatea maximă de hrană pe care o poate mânca și traseul pe care îl poate urma pentru a culege această cantitate maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mouse.in` conține pe prima linie două numere $m$ și $n$ reprezentând numărul de linii respectiv numărul de coloane ale cutiei, iar pe următoarele $m$ linii cele $m \cdot n$ numere reprezentând cantitatea de hrană existentă în fiecare cămăruță, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire
În fișierul de ieșire `mouse.out` se vor scrie pe prima linie două numere separate printr-un spațiu: numărul de cămăruțe vizitate și cantitatea de hrană maximă culeasă. Pe următoarele linii se va scrie un traseu posibil pentru cantitatea dată, sub formă de perechi de numere, începând cu $(1, 1)$ și terminând cu $(m, n)$.

# Restricții și precizări
- Toate valorile din fișier sunt numere naturale între $1$ și $100$.
- Veți primi 40 de puncte pentru afișarea primelor două numere.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Function to find the maximum food path
def find_max_food_path(food_matrix, m, n):
    # Create a memoization matrix to store solutions to subproblems
    dp = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=int)
    path = [[[] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

    # Base case initialization
    dp[0, 0] = food_matrix[0, 0]
    path[0][0] = [(1, 1)]

    # Initialize first row and first column of dp and path matrices
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i, 0] = dp[i-1, 0] + food_matrix[i, 0]
        path[i][0] = path[i-1][0] + [(i+1, 1)]
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0, j] = dp[0, j-1] + food_matrix[0, j]
        path[0][j] = path[0][j-1] + [(1, j+1)]

    # Fill up the dp and path matrices
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if dp[i-1, j] > dp[i, j-1]:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i-1, j] + food_matrix[i, j]
                path[i][j] = path[i-1][j] + [(i+1, j+1)]
            else:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i, j-1] + food_matrix[i, j]
                path[i][j] = path[i][j-1] + [(i+1, j+1)]

    # Return the max food and the path for the last element
    return dp[m-1, n-1], path[m-1][n-1]

# Read the input from 'mouse.in'
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    food_matrix = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=int)
    for i in range(m):
        food_matrix[i] = np.array(file.readline().split(), dtype=int)

# Get the maximum amount of food and the path
max_food, max_path = find_max_food_path(food_matrix, m, n)

# Write the output to 'mouse.out'
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(max_path)} {max_food}\n")
    for p in max_path:
        file.write(f"{p[0]} {p[1]}\n")
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum amount of food that can be collected while moving from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The `dp` matrix stores the maximum food obtained to reach each cell, and the `path` matrix keeps track of the path taken to reach the corresponding cell in the `dp` matrix. The solution also uses the NumPy library to efficiently work with matrices and perform calculations. The final path is reconstructed from the `path` matrix and written to the `mouse.out` file along with the maximum food collected.

The exit code indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which means it is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed.

Given that the environment does not have `numpy` installed, and considering the memory constraints specified in the challenge, a solution without using `numpy` is required. We can use a standard list of lists to solve the dynamic programming problem in Python. Here's the complete solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Function to find the maximum food path
def find_max_food_path(food_matrix, m, n):
    # Create a memoization matrix to store solutions to subproblems
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    path = [[[] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

    # Base case initialization
    dp[0][0] = food_matrix[0][0]
    path[0][0] = [(1, 1)]

    # Initialize first row and first column of dp and path matrices
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + food_matrix[i][0]
        path[i][0] = path[i-1][0] + [(i+1, 1)]
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + food_matrix[0][j]
        path[0][j] = path[0][j-1] + [(1, j+1)]

    # Fill up the dp and path matrices
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + food_matrix[i][j]
                path[i][j] = path[i-1][j] + [(i+1, j+1)]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + food_matrix[i][j]
                path[i][j] = path[i][j-1] + [(i+1, j+1)]

    # Return the max food and the path for the last element
    return dp[m-1][n-1], path[m-1][n-1]

# Read the input from 'mouse.in'
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    food_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Get the maximum amount of food and the path
max_food, max_path = find_max_food_path(food_matrix, m, n)

# Write the output to 'mouse.out'
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(max_path)} {max_food}\n")
    for p in max_path:
        file.write(f"{p[0]} {p[1]}\n")
```

This code snippet follows the same dynamic programming approach as the previous solution but replaces the `numpy` arrays with native Python lists of lists. It should work in a typical Python environment without requiring additional libraries. The I/O operations are the same, with the input being read from 'mouse.in' and the output being written to 'mouse.out'.

The previous solution erroneously implemented the dynamic programming approach, optimizing only for the right and down movement at each step, which does not fulfill the requirement of finding the path with the maximum food. Instead, we need to check all possible paths and select the one with the maximum food. This problem is more suitable for a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the path with the maximum food, as we need to consider all possible paths to ensure we find the optimal one.

Here is the corrected solution using DFS:

```python
# Function to perform DFS and find the maximum food path
def dfs(food_matrix, x, y, m, n, path, visited, max_path, max_food):
    # Mark the current cell as visited and add it to the path
    visited.add((x, y))
    path.append((x + 1, y + 1))

    # Update max_food and max_path if this path collects more food
    current_food = sum(food_matrix[i-1][j-1] for i, j in path)
    if current_food > max_food[0]:
        max_food[0] = current_food
        max_path[0] = path[:]

    # Move to the right
    if y + 1 < n and (x, y + 1) not in visited:
        dfs(food_matrix, x, y + 1, m, n, path, visited, max_path, max_food)

    # Move downwards
    if x + 1 < m and (x + 1, y) not in visited:
        dfs(food_matrix, x + 1, y, m, n, path, visited, max_path, max_food)

    # Backtrack: unmark the current cell as visited and remove it from the path
    visited.remove((x, y))
    path.pop()

# Read the input from 'mouse.in'
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    food_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize variables for DFS
visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited cells
path = []        # Current path being explored
max_path = [[]]  # Optimal path with maximum food
max_food = [0]   # Maximum food collected

# Perform DFS from the top-left corner
dfs(food_matrix, 0, 0, m, n, path, visited, max_path, max_food)

# Write the output to 'mouse.out'
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(max_path[0])} {max_food[0]}\n")
    for p in max_path[0]:
        file.write(f"{p[0]} {p[1]}\n")
```

The corrected solution uses DFS to explore all possible paths from the starting cell to the ending cell. It maintains a set of visited cells to prevent revisiting the same cell. The `max_path` and `max_food` are updated whenever a path with more food is found. The backtracking step ensures that we explore all possible paths without revisiting cells. Finally, the solution writes the maximum number of visited cells and the path to 'mouse.out'.

The results differ because the previous DFS implementation did not explore all possible paths that the mouse can take. In the problem statement, the mouse can move to any adjacent rooms (left, right, up, down) as long as it doesn't visit the same room twice. The algorithm has to be revised to consider all four directions and backtrack properly to explore each path to its entirety.

Let's correct the DFS implementation to account for all movement directions:

```python
def dfs(food_matrix, x, y, m, n, path, visited, max_path, max_food):
    # Mark the current cell as visited and add to the path
    visited.add((x, y))
    path.append((x + 1, y + 1))
    current_food = sum(food_matrix[i-1][j-1] for i, j in path)
    
    # If we reached the bottom-right corner, update max values if needed
    if (x, y) == (m - 1, n - 1) and current_food > max_food[0]:
        max_food[0] = current_food
        max_path[0] = path[:]
    
    # Explore adjacent cells
    for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:  # down, up, right, left
        if 0 <= x + dx < m and 0 <= y + dy < n and (x + dx, y + dy) not in visited:
            dfs(food_matrix, x + dx, y + dy, m, n, path, visited, max_path, max_food)
    
    # Backtrack: unmark the current cell as visited and remove from the path
    visited.remove((x, y))
    path.pop()

# Read the input from 'mouse.in'
with open('mouse.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    food_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize variables for DFS
visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited rooms
path = []        # Current path being explored
max_path = [[]]  # Optimal path with maximum food
max_food = [0]   # Maximum food collected

# Perform DFS from the top-left corner
dfs(food_matrix, 0, 0, m, n, path, visited, max_path, max_food)

# Write the output to 'mouse.out'
with open('mouse.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(max_path[0])} {max_food[0]}\n")
    for p in max_path[0]:
        file.write(f"{p[0]} {p[1]}\n")
```

In this revised solution, the DFS now correctly considers movement in all four possible directions (down, up, right, left) and continues searching until it reaches the bottom-right corner. It backtracks appropriately to explore all possible paths and keeps track of the maximum amount of food collected along with the corresponding path. This should yield the expected output when the mouse has multiple options for movement. The updated solution reads from `mouse.in` and writes to `mouse.out`, adhering to the problem constraints.
