Tânărul Harry Potter a descoperit într-una din camerele castelului Hogwarts, o hartă, care în urma unei vrăji a făcut să apară un text secret. Textul scris doar cu litere mici ale alfabetului englez, constituie o cheie spre o vrajă nouă folositoare la meciurile de vâjhaț. Cheia nouă se obține astfel:

* din textul secret se formează toate cuvintele posibile din litere aflate pe poziții consecutive
* dintre cuvintele formate se alege cel care este cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Se consideră că două cuvinte $a_1 a_2 a_3 \dots a_k$ < $b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots b_l$, cuvintele fiind date prin caracterele ce le compun, sunt în ordine lexicografică dacă există un indice $i \leq k$ sau $i \leq l$ astfel încât $a_i < b_i$ iar $a_j = b_j$ oricare ar fi $j < i$.

Exemplu: dacă textul găsit de Harry este `abcd` atunci din el se vor obține cuvintele: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `ab`, `bc`, `cd`, `abc`, `bcd`, `abcd`, iar soluția este `d` fiind cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, citind textul inițial, determină cuvântul cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic dintre toate cuvintele formate în modul explicat mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `harry.in` conține o singură linie pe care este scris textul inițial.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `harry.out` va conține pe prima linie cuvântul ce constituie soluție.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq$ lungime text $\leq 255$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input data from file
with open('harry.in', 'r') as file:
    text = file.readline().strip()

# The optimal solution requires to find the largest (lexicographically) character in the text,
# then the largest that follows it and constitutes a word, and so on, until the end.
# No need to generate all possible substrings as it's not efficient in terms of time and memory.

# Convert the text into a numpy array for efficient processing
text_array = np.array(list(text))

# Create an output array to store the lexicographically largest word
max_word = []

# Find the index of the lexicographically largest character
max_index = np.argmax(text_array)

# Add the largest character to the max_word
max_word.append(text_array[max_index])

# Repeat the process for the characters following the last added character
while max_index < len(text) - 1:
    max_index = np.argmax(text_array[max_index+1:]) + max_index + 1
    max_word.append(text_array[max_index])

# Convert the max_word list into a string
max_word_str = ''.join(max_word)

# Write the output data to file
with open('harry.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(max_word_str)
```
```
Note: The above code may not be the most memory efficient given the memory constraints specified. However, it's provided as a starting point and could be optimized further if memory usage is critical. For this example, we've made use of NumPy for its efficient array handling and argmax functionality, which can help in finding the lexographically largest character efficiently.

```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Open 'harry.in' for reading and 'harry.out' for writing
with open('harry.in', 'r') as infile, open('harry.out', 'w') as outfile:
    text = infile.readline().strip()  # Read the text from the input file
    max_char = max(text)              # Identify the maximum lexicographical character
    
    # Find the start index of the first occurrence of the max char
    start_index = text.rfind(max_char)
    
    # The word from this index to the end of the string is the largest
    largest_word = text[start_index:]
    
    # Write the largest word to the output file
    outfile.write(largest_word)
```
```

Note: In this final solution, I have avoided using numpy as it is more memory-efficient to use built-in Python functions. The solution involves finding the maximum character and then finding the rightmost occurrence of this character. Since any string that starts with this maximum character will be lexicographically larger than any string that does not, the string from this rightmost occurrence to the end is the largest possible string.

    largest_word = text[start_index:]
    
    # Write the largest word to the output file
    outfile.write(largest_word)
```
```

The revised solution no longer uses numpy or any other libraries. It uses built-in string methods to find the lexicographically largest word by looking for the maximum character and its rightmost occurrence. The solution reads from 'harry.in' and writes the result to 'harry.out', as required, without using `input()` or `print()`.

        for j in range(i + 1, len(text) + 1):

                largest_word = text[i:j]
    
    # Write the largest word to the output file
    outfile.write(largest_word)
```
```
This solution iterates through all possible substrings in the given text and updates the `largest_word` whenever a lexicographically larger substring is found. The result is written to 'harry.out' without using `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations.

            largest_word = text[i:]

    # Write the largest word to the output file
    outfile.write(largest_word)
```
```
This improved solution reads the input from 'harry.in', identifies the lexicographically largest word by comparing each character in the string, and writes the result to 'harry.out'. It optimizes the process by only considering new potential largest words when the current character is greater lexicographically than the current largest word's first character, and it does so without using unnecessary memory for storing all possible substrings. The solution avoids using `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations.

    text = file.readline().strip()  # Read the text from the input file

# Initialize the largest word as the first character of the text

    # We only care about the character if it's equal or larger than the first character of the current largest word

# Open 'harry.out' for writing the result
with open('harry.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(largest_word)
```
```
This solution scans through the input string and updates the `largest_word` whenever it encounters a character that is either greater than or equal to the current largest word's first character, and the subsequent substring is lexicographically larger than the current `largest_word`. It writes the result to 'harry.out' file without using `input()` or `print()`.

    # Read the text from the input file

    # Initialize the largest word to the first character in the text
    largest_word = text[0]

    # Iterate over the text starting from the second character
    for i in range(1, len(text)):
        # If the current character is lexicographically larger than the
        # first character of the largest word found so far, it becomes the new largest word
        if text[i] > largest_word[0]:
            largest_word = text[i:]

    # Write the largest word to the output file
    outfile.write(largest_word)
```
```
In this solution, a single pass through the text is enough to find the largest lexicographic substring. For every character in the string, we check if it's greater than the first character of the current largest word. If it is, we take the substring starting from that character to the end as the new largest word. The result is written to 'harry.out', as specified, and reading is done from 'harry.in'. No `input()` or `print()` functions are used for I/O operations.
