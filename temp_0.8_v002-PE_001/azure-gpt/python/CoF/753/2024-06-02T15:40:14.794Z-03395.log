Tânărul Harry Potter a descoperit într-una din camerele castelului Hogwarts, o hartă, care în urma unei vrăji a făcut să apară un text secret. Textul scris doar cu litere mici ale alfabetului englez, constituie o cheie spre o vrajă nouă folositoare la meciurile de vâjhaț. Cheia nouă se obține astfel:

* din textul secret se formează toate cuvintele posibile din litere aflate pe poziții consecutive
* dintre cuvintele formate se alege cel care este cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

Se consideră că două cuvinte $a_1 a_2 a_3 \dots a_k$ < $b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots b_l$, cuvintele fiind date prin caracterele ce le compun, sunt în ordine lexicografică dacă există un indice $i \leq k$ sau $i \leq l$ astfel încât $a_i < b_i$ iar $a_j = b_j$ oricare ar fi $j < i$.

Exemplu: dacă textul găsit de Harry este `abcd` atunci din el se vor obține cuvintele: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `ab`, `bc`, `cd`, `abc`, `bcd`, `abcd`, iar soluția este `d` fiind cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, citind textul inițial, determină cuvântul cel mai mare din punct de vedere lexicografic dintre toate cuvintele formate în modul explicat mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `harry.in` conține o singură linie pe care este scris textul inițial.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `harry.out` va conține pe prima linie cuvântul ce constituie soluție.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq$ lungime text $\leq 255$;

Example:
`harry.in`
```
tatep
```

`harry.out`
```
tep

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Reads the input from the file
with open('harry.in', 'r') as file:
    text = file.read().strip()

# Find the maximum lexicographic substring
max_char = max(text)
max_substrings = [max_char]
start_indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(text) if c == max_char]

# Extend the maximum substrings by checking subsequent characters
for start in start_indices:
    i = start + 1
    while i < len(text) and text[i] >= text[i - 1]:
        max_substrings.append(text[start:i + 1])
        i += 1

# Find the lexicographically largest substring
largest_substring = max(max_substrings)

# Write the output to the file
with open('harry.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(largest_substring + '\n')
```

Explanation:
- First, we read the text from the input file `harry.in` without any leading or trailing whitespace.
- We find the maximum character in the text as it will be the first character of the lexicographically largest substring.
- We list all occurrences of the maximum character because any of them could be the start of the largest substring.
- For each occurrence of the maximum character, we extend the substring by adding the next characters only if each character is not smaller than the previous one. This is because any decrease would result in a lexicographically smaller substring, so we stop extending as soon as we find a character that is smaller.
- Among the extended substrings, we find the lexicographically largest one by using Python's `max` function.
- Lastly, we write the largest substring to the output file `harry.out`.

This approach is efficient because:
- It limits the search space to substrings starting with the lexicographically maximal character.
- It does not generate all possible substrings, which would be inefficient both in terms of time and memory.
- It uses Python's built-in functions which are optimized for performance.

The issue is that the `numpy` module is not being used in the code, and yet it is being imported. This not only causes the `ModuleNotFoundError`, but it's also unnecessary for the solution. To fix the program, we must remove the import of the `numpy` module since we do not actually utilize it in the solution.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Reads the input from the file
with open('harry.in', 'r') as file:
    text = file.read().strip()

# Find the maximum lexicographic substring
max_char = max(text)
max_substrings = [max_char]
start_indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(text) if c == max_char]

# Extend the maximum substrings by checking subsequent characters
for start in start_indices:
    i = start + 1
    while i < len(text) and text[i] >= text[i - 1]:
        max_substrings.append(text[start:i + 1])
        i += 1

# Find the lexicographically largest substring
largest_substring = max(max_substrings)

# Write the output to the file
with open('harry.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(largest_substring + '\n')
```

Explanation:
- We removed the unused `import numpy as np` statement.
- The rest of the code remains unchanged, finding the lexicographically largest substring and writing it to the output file `harry.out`.
- This solution is efficient in both time and memory usage and adheres to the constraints given in the challenge description.

The issue with the previous solution is that it only considers substrings that start with the maximal character and continue with non-decreasing sequences of characters. However, the goal is to find the lexicographically largest substring, which could actually start with the maximal character but then include characters that are lexicographically smaller than their predecessors.

In the example with `tatep`, the largest lexicographically substring is `tep` because it starts with `t`, the lexicographically largest starting character, and then `e` which is smaller than `t` but still creates the largest possible substring that follows in the sequence.

Let's correct the solution by starting with the maximal character and continuing until the end of the string. This would ensure that we don't miss any possible substrings that could be the solution. We also need to consider each maximal character as a starting point for a potential substring.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Reads the input from the file
with open('harry.in', 'r') as file:
    text = file.read().strip()

# Find the maximum lexicographic character
max_char = max(text)

# Find all the substrings that start with the maximum character
max_substrings = []
for i in range(len(text)):
    if text[i] == max_char:
        # Add all substrings that start with this instance of the maximum character
        for j in range(i, len(text)):
            max_substrings.append(text[i:j+1])

# Find the lexicographically largest substring
largest_substring = max(max_substrings)

# Write the output to the file
with open('harry.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(largest_substring + '\n')
```

Explanation:
- We iterate through the text to find all instances of the maximal character.
- For each instance, we consider all substrings starting with this character until the end of the text.
- This ensures that we do not miss any potential substrings that could be lexicographically larger than the ones we have found so far.
- We then find the lexicographically largest substring among these candidates.
- Finally, we write this largest substring to the output file `harry.out`.
