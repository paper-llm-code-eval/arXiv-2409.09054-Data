Áles a primit ca temă următoarea problemă: *"Fiind dat un șir $A$ cu $N$ numere naturale distincte, să se calculeze suma cifrelor fiecărui element al șirului"*.

După ce și-a terminat tema, acesta observă că sunt mai multe perechi de indici ($i, j$) pentru care dacă $A_i < A_j$ atunci $S_i > S_j$, unde $S_i$ reprezintă suma cifrelor lui $A_i$. El le va numi pe acestea perechi speciale de indici.

# Cerință

Terminând repede tema, Áles primește o temă suplimentară cu două cerințe:

1. Determină două numere aflate în șirul $A$, pentru care indicii corespunzători formează o pereche specială.
2. Câte perechi speciale de indici ($i, j$) se găsesc în șirul $A$?

Based on the standard error, it is clear that the `numpy` module is not installed or not available in the environment where the program is being executed. Since the challenge requires optimizing memory usage and we are not allowed to use third-party libraries like numpy, we will need to reimplement the solution using only built-in Python functionalities.

Here's a revised solution using only standard Python libraries and optimizing for memory and time efficiency where possible.

```python
# Solution written in a markdown code block

# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

# Read from pseudocmp.in
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as file:
    T, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each element
S = [sum_of_digits(a) for a in A]

# Write to pseudocmp.out
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as file:
    if T == 1:
        # Find a pair that satisfies the special indices condition
        found = False
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    file.write(f"{A[i]} {A[j]}\n")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            file.write("-1\n")
    else:
        # Count the number of special index pairs
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    count += 1
        file.write(f"{count}\n")
```

This revised solution should work without needing `numpy` and should fit within the memory constraints provided. It is important to note that this solution is not the most optimal in terms of time complexity (O(N^2) for both task 1 and task 2), but it meets the requirements of the challenge within the specified constraints.

Upon evaluation, it seems that the program is not producing the expected output because it is not considering the case where `A[i]` and `A[j]` can be a valid pair even if `A[i]` is not strictly less than `A[j]` (for example, the problem statement does not require `A[i]` to be strictly less than `A[j]`, but just that `S[i]` should be greater than `S[j]`).

Here's a revised version of the program that should produce the correct output:

```python
# Solution written in a markdown code block

# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(n):
    s = 0
    while n:
        s, n = s + n % 10, n // 10
    return s

# Read from pseudocmp.in
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as file:
    T, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each element
S = [sum_of_digits(a) for a in A]

# Write to pseudocmp.out
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as file:
    if T == 1:
        # Find a pair that satisfies the special indices condition
        found = False
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if i != j and A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    file.write(f"{A[i]} {A[j]}\n")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            file.write("-1\n")
    else:
        # Count the number of special index pairs
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if i != j and A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    count += 1
        file.write(f"{count}\n")
```

This solution should correctly identify pairs `(Ai, Aj)` such that `Ai < Aj` and `Si > Sj`. Note that we are now considering all possible pairs by checking all indices `j` for each index `i`, not just `j > i`, and we are also ensuring that `i` is not equal to `j`. This will correctly handle the case provided in the example where `99` and `123` form such a special pair according to the digit sum comparison.

The time complexity remains O(N^2) for both tasks, which is acceptable within the given constraints. However, if we were to deal with larger inputs, a more efficient algorithm would be needed to avoid potential performance issues.

The revised solution still has a bug because it can potentially return the wrong pair of numbers when multiple special pairs exist. In the input data, both `(99, 213)` and `(99, 123)` are valid special pairs according to the problem definition, but the expected output specifically asks for `(99, 123)`. This indicates that we need to consider all pairs and select the first valid pair of numbers where the smaller number in the pair is the smallest possible number that can form a special pair with any larger number.

To fix the solution, we need to adjust the algorithm to iterate over the array A in such a way that for each number, we look for the smallest number in A that can form a special pair with any larger number and is the first of such occurrences in the input list. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution written in a markdown code block

# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(n):
    s = 0
    while n:
        s, n = s + n % 10, n // 10
    return s

# Read from pseudocmp.in
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as file:
    T, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each element
S = [sum_of_digits(a) for a in A]

# Write to pseudocmp.out
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as file:
    if T == 1:
        # Find a pair that satisfies the special indices condition
        found = False
        special_pair = None
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    if not found or A[i] < A[special_pair[0]]:
                        special_pair = (i, j)
                        found = True
        if found:
            file.write(f"{A[special_pair[0]]} {A[special_pair[1]]}\n")
        else:
            file.write("-1\n")
    else:
        # Count the number of special index pairs
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    count += 1
        file.write(f"{count}\n")
```

This code now maintains a `special_pair` variable that tracks the indices of the current best special pair based on the problem's requirements. It updates this variable whenever it finds a special pair with a smaller first element. After scanning all pairs, it writes the corresponding numbers to `pseudocmp.out` if a special pair was found, or `-1` otherwise. This should produce the expected output.

The previous solution does not produce the expected output because it does not correctly prioritize the pairs based on the smallest number that forms a special pair. The expected output implies that when searching for special pairs, we should first prioritize finding the smallest number that can form such a pair, and only then find the smallest larger number to complete the pair.

To correct this, we need to sort the indices of the array A by the value of A, but we also need to maintain a separate sorted list of indices by the sum of digits so we can iterate through the numbers in A in ascending order, and for each number, find the smallest larger number with a smaller digit sum.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution written in a markdown code block

# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

# Read from pseudocmp.in
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as file:
    T, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each element
S = [sum_of_digits(a) for a in A]

# Generate indices sorted by the values in A
sorted_indices_by_A = sorted(range(N), key=lambda i: A[i])

# Generate indices sorted by the sum of digits, and then by the values in A
sorted_indices_by_S = sorted(range(N), key=lambda i: (S[i], A[i]))

# Write to pseudocmp.out
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as file:
    if T == 1:
        # Find a pair that satisfies the special indices condition
        found = False
        for i in sorted_indices_by_S:
            for j in sorted_indices_by_A:
                if A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    file.write(f"{A[i]} {A[j]}\n")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            file.write("-1\n")
    else:
        # Count the number of special index pairs
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if A[i] < A[j] and S[i] > S[j]:
                    count += 1
        file.write(f"{count}\n")
```

In this solution, the array `sorted_indices_by_S` is used to iterate through the elements in ascending order of their sum of digits (and then by the value if the sums are equal), ensuring that we find the smallest number with a larger sum first. The array `sorted_indices_by_A` is used to find the next smallest number in A that creates a valid pair. The inner loop breaks as soon as a valid pair is found, ensuring we find the smallest such number. This should produce the expected output for the example given and should work correctly for all other cases within the defined constraints.

The most recent implementation still does not yield the expected output because it incorrectly sorts the indices for the inner loop. The indices should be sorted by `A[i]` in ascending order to ensure that when we find a pair `(A[i], A[j])`, `A[i]` is the smallest number that can form a special pair with any larger number `A[j]`.

To fix this issue, we will modify the approach as follows:
1. Create pairs of (number, sum of digits, original index) for each element in the array.
2. Sort this list first by the sum of digits in ascending order and then by the original number in descending order. This will allow us to iterate over the numbers, starting with the lowest sum of digits, and if two numbers have the same sum, we will consider the larger number first.
3. Iterate through this sorted list to find a valid special pair for task 1 or count the valid special pairs for task 2.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution written in a markdown code block

# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

# Read from pseudocmp.in
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as file:
    T, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each element and create list of tuples (number, sum of digits, index)
number_digit_sum_pairs = [(a, sum_of_digits(a), i) for i, a in enumerate(A)]

# Sort the list by sum of digits in ascending order and then by number in descending order
number_digit_sum_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))

# Write to pseudocmp.out
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as file:
    if T == 1:
        # Find a pair that satisfies the special indices condition
        found = False
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if number_digit_sum_pairs[i][0] < number_digit_sum_pairs[j][0]:
                    file.write(f"{number_digit_sum_pairs[i][0]} {number_digit_sum_pairs[j][0]}\n")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            file.write("-1\n")
    else:
        # Count the number of special index pairs
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if number_digit_sum_pairs[i][0] < number_digit_sum_pairs[j][0]:
                    count += 1
        file.write(f"{count}\n")
```

This solution should correctly find the first special pair where the first number in the pair is the smallest possible number that can form a special pair with any larger number. The `sort()` call ensures that we first consider numbers with the smallest sum of digits, and among those, we consider the largest numbers first, according to the expected behavior. This should produce the expected output for the provided example and any other input within the problem's constraints.

The issue with the previous solution is that it sorts the `number_digit_sum_pairs` list by the sum of digits and then by the numbers in the opposite order. Instead, we should sort the numbers only by their sum of digits and, when looking for a special pair, ensure that we select the smallest number that can form a special pair with any larger number.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the list only by the sum of digits of each element, keeping the same relative order for elements with the same sum of digits.
2. Iterate through the sorted list and find the first instance where a number with a lower sum of digits appears after a number with a higher sum of digits. This will be our special pair for task T=1.
3. For task T=2, count all such instances.

Let's implement this corrected solution:

```python
# Solution written in a markdown code block

# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

# Read from pseudocmp.in
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as file:
    T, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each element
S = [sum_of_digits(a) for a in A]

# Sort indices based on the sum of digits
sum_indices = sorted(range(N), key=lambda i: S[i])

# Write to pseudocmp.out
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as file:
    if T == 1:
        # Find a pair that satisfies the special indices condition
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if A[sum_indices[i]] < A[sum_indices[j]] and S[sum_indices[i]] > S[sum_indices[j]]:
                    file.write(f"{A[sum_indices[i]]} {A[sum_indices[j]]}\n")
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            file.write("-1\n")
    else:
        # Count the number of special index pairs
        count = 0
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if A[sum_indices[i]] < A[sum_indices[j]] and S[sum_indices[i]] > S[sum_indices[j]]:
                    count += 1
        file.write(f"{count}\n")

This solution calculates the sum of digits for each number in the array and then sorts the indices of the numbers based on their digit sums. When looking for a special pair (for T=1), it iterates through the sorted list to find the first instance where a smaller number (in terms of actual value) has a larger digit sum than a number that comes later in the sorted list, which ensures that the first number is the smallest possible number that can form a special pair. For counting the pairs (for T=2), it counts all such instances in the list. This approach should yield the correct and expected output.
