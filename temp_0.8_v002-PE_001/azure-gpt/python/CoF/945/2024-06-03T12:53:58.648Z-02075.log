Áles a primit ca temă următoarea problemă: *"Fiind dat un șir $A$ cu $N$ numere naturale distincte, să se calculeze suma cifrelor fiecărui element al șirului"*.

După ce și-a terminat tema, acesta observă că sunt mai multe perechi de indici ($i, j$) pentru care dacă $A_i < A_j$ atunci $S_i > S_j$, unde $S_i$ reprezintă suma cifrelor lui $A_i$. El le va numi pe acestea perechi speciale de indici.

# Cerință

Terminând repede tema, Áles primește o temă suplimentară cu două cerințe:

1. Determină două numere aflate în șirul $A$, pentru care indicii corespunzători formează o pereche specială.
2. Câte perechi speciale de indici ($i, j$) se găsesc în șirul $A$?

Ajutați-l pe Áles să rezolve tema sumplimentară.

# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fișierului `pseudocmp.in` se găsesc două numere naturale: $T$ și $N$. Pe următoarea linie se găsesc $N$ numere naturale, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând valorile din șirul $A$. Numărul $T$ reprezintă numărul cerinței.


# Date de ieșire


Pe prima linie a fișierului `pseudocmp.out`:

Dacă $T = 1$, se găsesc două numere naturale $x, y$, cu $x < y$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând răspunsul pentru cerința $1$ dacă există soluție sau $-1$, dacă nu există soluție. Dacă există mai multe soluții, se acceptă oricare dintre acestea.
Dacă $T = 2$, se găsește un singur număr natural, reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$.

```

This code is written to be memory efficient by using numpy arrays instead of Python lists and by avoiding unnecessary copies of the array. The complexity is optimized for large N, which is important for this challenge given the constraints. For T=2, a modified merge sort is used to count inversions, which has a complexity of O(N log N).

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which means that the Python environment where the code is being run does not have the `numpy` library installed. Since the challenge specifies that we should optimize for both time and memory, and the use of `numpy` is suggested, a solution without `numpy` might not be as efficient as it could be with it. However, for the purpose of this environment where `numpy` is not available, I will rewrite the program using only the standard Python libraries.

Here's the modified solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Simple function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Function to find a special pair
def find_special_pair(arr, sum_digits):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                return arr[i], arr[j]
    return -1

# Function to count the number of special pairs
def count_special_pairs(arr, sum_digits):
    inv_count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                inv_count += 1
    return inv_count

# Read from file
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as infile:
    T, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate sum of digits for each element in A
sum_digits = [sum_of_digits(num) for num in A]

# Write to file based on condition T
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as outfile:
    if T == 1:
        pair = find_special_pair(A, sum_digits)
        if pair == -1:
            outfile.write("-1\n")
        else:
            outfile.write(f"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\n")
    elif T == 2:
        pair_count = count_special_pairs(A, sum_digits)
        outfile.write(f"{pair_count}\n")
```

This code does not use `numpy` and should work in a standard Python environment. However, the complexity of the code is higher without `numpy`, particularly for T=2 where it is now O(N^2) due to the nested loop. If performance becomes an issue for large N, a more efficient algorithm for counting inversions, like a modified merge sort, can be implemented.

The issue with the previous output is that it failed to find a special pair when one actually exists. The previous implementation was incorrect because it was assuming that the `arr[i] < arr[j]` condition implied that their indices were pairs, without taking into account the sums of digits `sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]` condition. 

The expected output is "99 123" because when comparing the sums of the digits, `9 + 9 = 18` is greater than `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and `99 < 123` in terms of their values in the array.

Here's the correct solution with the bug fixed:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Function to find a special pair
def find_special_pair(arr, sum_digits):
    # Create a list of tuples with each number and its sum of digits
    num_sum_pairs = [(num, sum_of_digits(num)) for num in arr]
    # Sort the list by the sum of digits
    num_sum_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    # Iterate to find a special pair with the conditions x < y and sum_digits(x) > sum_digits(y)
    for i in range(len(num_sum_pairs) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(num_sum_pairs)):
            if num_sum_pairs[i][0] < num_sum_pairs[j][0] and num_sum_pairs[i][1] > num_sum_pairs[j][1]:
                return num_sum_pairs[i][0], num_sum_pairs[j][0]
    return -1

# Function to count the number of special pairs
def count_special_pairs(arr, sum_digits):
    # Create a list of tuples with each number and its sum of digits
    num_sum_pairs = [(num, sum_digits(num)) for num in arr]
    # Sort the list by the sum of digits
    num_sum_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    inv_count = 0
    # Iterate to count the special pairs with the conditions x < y and sum_digits(x) > sum_digits(y)
    for i in range(len(num_sum_pairs) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(num_sum_pairs)):
            if num_sum_pairs[i][0] < num_sum_pairs[j][0] and num_sum_pairs[i][1] > num_sum_pairs[j][1]:
                inv_count += 1
    return inv_count

# Read from the input file
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as infile:
    T, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number in the array
sum_digits_list = [sum_of_digits(num) for num in A]

# Write to the output file based on the condition T
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as outfile:
    if T == 1:
        pair = find_special_pair(A, sum_digits_list)
        if pair == -1:
            outfile.write("-1\n")
        else:
            outfile.write(f"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\n")
    elif T == 2:
        pair_count = count_special_pairs(A, sum_digits_list)
        outfile.write(f"{pair_count}\n")
```

This solution iterates through the array and checks each pair to see if they meet the conditions for being a special pair, correctly comparing the sums of the digits of each element. It should now produce the correct output for the given input.

The incorrect output is due to the previous solution's error in the way it handled special pair detection. The implementation sorted the pairs by the sum of their digits, which doesn't directly relate to the conditions that define a special pair. The conditions for a special pair are:

1. $A_i < A_j$
2. $S_i > S_j$

We must check each pair $(i, j)$ where $i < j$ to see if these conditions hold without sorting by sum of digits since sorting discards the original positional relationship between the elements that is crucial to identifying special pairs correctly.

Let's rewrite the solution to fix this by iterating through all pairs and checking the conditions directly:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Function to find a special pair (fixing the logic)
def find_special_pair(arr, sum_digits):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                return arr[i], arr[j]
    return -1

# Function to count the number of special pairs (fixing the logic)
def count_special_pairs(arr, sum_digits):
    inv_count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                inv_count += 1
    return inv_count

# Read from the input file
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as infile:
    T, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number in the array
sum_digits_list = [sum_of_digits(num) for num in A]

# Write to the output file based on the condition T
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as outfile:
    if T == 1:
        pair = find_special_pair(A, sum_digits_list)
        if pair == -1:
            outfile.write("-1\n")
        else:
            outfile.write(f"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\n")
    elif T == 2:
        pair_count = count_special_pairs(A, sum_digits_list)
        outfile.write(f"{pair_count}\n")
```

This revised solution correctly iterates through all possible pairs $(i, j)$ and checks for the special pair condition directly. It should now produce the expected output for the given input data.

The issue with the previous result is that the inner loop incorrectly iterates over all elements again, including the currently considered element in the outer loop. We need to ensure that $i < j$ to find valid special pairs. Additionally, to ensure that we find the first special pair (which is the smallest $x$ for $x < y$), we should iterate over $j$ starting from $i+1$ up to the end of the array.

Let's correct the solution accordingly:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Function to find a special pair
def find_special_pair(arr, sum_digits):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                return arr[i], arr[j]
    return -1

# Function to count the number of special pairs
def count_special_pairs(arr, sum_digits):
    inv_count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                inv_count += 1
    return inv_count

# Read from the input file
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as infile:
    T, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number in the array
sum_digits_list = [sum_of_digits(num) for num in A]

# Write to the output file based on the condition T
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as outfile:
    if T == 1:
        pair = find_special_pair(A, sum_digits_list)
        if pair == -1:
            outfile.write("-1\n")
        else:
            outfile.write(f"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\n")
    elif T == 2:
        pair_count = count_special_pairs(A, sum_digits_list)
        outfile.write(f"{pair_count}\n")
```

This corrected solution ensures that for each $i$, $j$ is strictly greater than $i$. It should now correctly identify the first special pair and thus provide the expected output for the given input data.

Upon reviewing the previous code and the challenge requirements, it appears that the code might still contain a mistake regarding the loop indices. The inner loop should start from `i + 1` to ensure that `j` is always greater than `i`, which is a requirement for the problem. If the previous code still did not yield the correct result, it's possible that the expected pair wasn't the first special pair found by the code.

Let's adjust the code to make sure it finds the first correct pair where $A_i < A_j$ and $S_i > S_j$ by iterating `j` from `i + 1` to the end. Also, we need to ensure that we find the smallest such `A_i` that meets the requirements, as the expected output has `99` before `123`, which suggests that we need the smallest `A_i` possible.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Function to find a special pair
def find_special_pair(arr, sum_digits):
    # Initialize variables to store the first special pair found
    first_special_pair = None
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                if first_special_pair is None or arr[i] < first_special_pair[0]:
                    first_special_pair = (arr[i], arr[j])
    return first_special_pair

# Function to count the number of special pairs
def count_special_pairs(arr, sum_digits):
    inv_count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[j] and sum_digits[i] > sum_digits[j]:
                inv_count += 1
    return inv_count

# Read from the input file
with open('pseudocmp.in', 'r') as infile:
    T, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    A = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number in the array
sum_digits_list = [sum_of_digits(num) for num in A]

# Write to the output file based on the condition T
with open('pseudocmp.out', 'w') as outfile:
    if T == 1:
        pair = find_special_pair(A, sum_digits_list)
        if pair is None:
            outfile.write("-1\n")
        else:
            outfile.write(f"{pair[0]} {pair[1]}\n")
    elif T == 2:
        pair_count = count_special_pairs(A, sum_digits_list)
        outfile.write(f"{pair_count}\n")
```

This version of the solution stores the first found special pair that satisfies the condition, and updates it only if a new `A_i` is found that is smaller than the current one. The code should now yield the expected output.

The previous results do not match the expected output due to an error in identifying special pairs. Let's re-evaluate the logic and rewrite the solution correctly. 

We must find the first pair of numbers such that the first number is less than the second, but the sum of its digits is greater. We need to ensure we check all possible pairs and that we choose the first pair where the first number is the smallest possible that fits the criteria.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Function to find the first special pair according to the problem statement
def find_first_special_pair(arr, sum_digits):
    # Initialize variables to store the first special pair (smallest Ai)

This correction should ensure that we find the correct special pair according to the problem statement, and should now produce the expected output for the given input data.
