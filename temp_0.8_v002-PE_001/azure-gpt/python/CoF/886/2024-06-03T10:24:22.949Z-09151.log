	* **nu** au laturi paralele cu OY;

# Date de intrare

Datele de intrare se citesc din fișierul `triunghiuri.in`, care are următoarea structură:

Pe prima linie se află numărul $p$, care indică cerința ce trebuie rezolvată ($p$ are valoarea $1$ sau $2$);
Pe a doua linie se află numărul natural $N$, reprezentând numărul punctelor date;
Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsesc câte două valori naturale $x \ y$, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctelor date.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `triunghiuri.out` va avea următoarea structură:

Dacă $p = 1$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul maxim de puncte care au aceeași abscisă (cerința $1$).
Dacă $p = 2$ se va scrie în fișier, pe prima linie, numărul triunghiurilor care se pot desena respectând condițiile date, modulo $1 \ 000 \ 003$, adică restul împărțirii numărului de triunghiuri la $1 \ 000 \ 003$ (cerința $2$).

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the system. Since the original problem statement requires optimizing both time and memory usage, and it has a strict memory limit, using `numpy` might not be necessary for this problem. We can solve the problem efficiently using native Python libraries like `collections.Counter`.

Here's the revised solution without using `numpy`:

```python

            if points[i][1] != points[j][1]:  # Ensure we don't have a horizontal line
                min_y = min(points[i][1], points[j][1])
                max_y = max(points[i][1], points[j][1])
                # Count how many points have the same x as points[i] but with y between points[i][1] and points[j][1]
                third_points = sum(1 for x, y in points if x == points[i][0] and min_y < y < max_y)
                # For each such point, we can form a triangle
                total_triangles += third_points
                total_triangles %= MOD

The provided code for solving problem 2 is incorrect because it only counts triangles with one side on the x-axis and the other two sides formed by points with the same x-coordinate as one of the base's endpoints. However, the problem requires counting triangles that have a base parallel to the OX axis and no side parallel to the OY axis, which means the third point of the triangle can be anywhere as long as it's not aligned vertically with the base points.

To fix this, we need to consider:

- A triangle base is formed by any two points with different y coordinates.
- The third point must have a y-coordinate between the y values of the base points and a different x-coordinate than the base points.

Here is a revised solution that counts the correct triangles for problem 2:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return p, N, points

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + "\n")

def solve_p1(points):
    x_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] += 1
    return max(x_counts.values())

def solve_p2(points):
    MOD = 1000003
    triangles = 0

    # A dictionary where keys are x coordinates and values are sorted y coordinates
    x_dict = defaultdict(list)
    for x, y in points:
        x_dict[x].append(y)

    # Sort all y lists to perform binary search later
    for x in x_dict:
        x_dict[x].sort()

    for i in range(len(points)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
            if points[i][1] != points[j][1]:  # We don't want a horizontal base
                count = 0
                # Only iterate through points that are not on the same x as the base points
                for x in x_dict:
                    if x != points[i][0] and x != points[j][0]:
                        # Count points between the y values of the base points
                        y_list = x_dict[x]
                        count += sum(1 for y in y_list if min(points[i][1], points[j][1]) < y < max(points[i][1], points[j][1]))
                triangles += count
                triangles %= MOD

    return triangles

def main():
    p, N, points = read_input('triunghiuri.in')
    if p == 1:
        result = solve_p1(points)
    elif p == 2:
        result = solve_p2(points)
    write_output('triunghiuri.out', result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code should read the input from `triunghiuri.in`, calculate the correct number of triangles for problem 2, and write the output to `triunghiuri.out`. Please test this corrected solution with the given file `triunghiuri.in` to verify that it produces the expected result.

Upon reviewing the revised solution and the requirements of the problem, it appears that my previous solution is still not correctly counting the triangles. The algorithm needs to be able to efficiently count the possible third points for the triangle that are not aligned vertically with the base points.

Here's the correct solution:

1. For each pair of points with different y-coordinates (forming the base of a potential triangle), calculate how many other points can serve as the third vertex of the triangle. The third vertex must have a y-coordinate that is not equal to the y-coordinates of the base points and an x-coordinate that is distinct from the x-coordinates of the base points.
2. To efficiently count these points, we can use a line sweep algorithm that processes points sorted by their x-coordinate, maintaining a count of points in a y-coordinate range.

Below is the fixed code implementing the correct logic:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return p, N, points

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + "\n")

def solve_p1(points):
    x_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] += 1
    return max(x_counts.values())

def solve_p2(points, N):
    MOD = 1000003
    triangles = 0

    # Sort points by y then x to easily iterate over pairs with different y-coordinates
    points.sort(key=lambda point: (point[1], point[0]))

    # Count points by x-coordinates
    x_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] += 1

    # Iterate over all pairs of points with different y-coordinates
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if points[i][1] != points[j][1]:  # Ensure we don't have a horizontal base
                # Count points that are not aligned vertically with the base points,
                # meaning points with different x-coordinates than the base points
                triangles += len(x_counts) - 2
                triangles %= MOD

    return triangles

def main():
    p, N, points = read_input('triunghiuri.in')
    if p == 1:
        result = solve_p1(points)
    elif p == 2:
        result = solve_p2(points, N)
    write_output('triunghiuri.out', result)

if __name__ == '__main__':

The previous solution has an error in the logic used to count the triangles. The current loop does not correctly ensure that the third point has a y-coordinate between the y-coordinates of the base points, nor does it ensure that the x-coordinate is different from those of the base points.

To fix the solution, we need to:

1. Keep track of the number of points at each y-coordinate.
2. For every pair of points that could be the base of a triangle (same y-coordinate), count all points that have a different x-coordinate and a y-coordinate that is not the same as the base points' y-coordinates.

Here is the correct code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def read_input(filename):

        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        N = int(file.readline().strip())

    for x, y in points:
        x_counts[x] += 1
        y_counts[y] += 1

    # For each point, calculate possible triangles
    for x, y in points:
        # Subtract the points with the same x or y coordinate
        triangles += (N - x_counts[x] - y_counts[y] + 1)
        triangles %= MOD

    return triangles

The previous code was not correctly calculating the number of triangles according to the problem's specifications. Let's correct the solution by implementing the following logic:

- Iterate through each unique pair of points that can form the base of the triangle parallel to the OX axis (having different y-coordinates but the same x-coordinate). This will ensure that we do not form a triangle with a side parallel to the OY axis.
- For each such base, find the number of points that can serve as the third vertex of the triangle, where the point's y-coordinate is not equal to either y-coordinate of the base points and the point's x-coordinate is not the same as the base's x-coordinate.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python

    # Calculate the number of triangles
    for x, y_list in x_groups.items():

It seems there was a misunderstanding of the problem's conditions in the previous attempts. Let's redefine the approach considering the problem requirements:

- We must count the triangles such that one side is parallel to the OX axis (horizontal), and no sides are parallel to the OY axis (vertical).
- The base of each triangle (the side parallel to the OX axis) is formed by two points with different y-coordinates.
- The third point of the triangle can be any other point that does not share the same x-coordinate with the base points and has a y-coordinate different from the base points.

The correct algorithm to accomplish this should:

1. Count the number of points at each x-coordinate (this will be used to ensure the third point does not share an x-coordinate with the base points).
2. Iterate through all pairs of points that can form a horizontal base (they must have different y-coordinates).
3. For each base, count all points that can serve as the third vertex of the triangle. These points must have a different x-coordinate from the base points and must lie either above or below both y-coordinates of the base points.

Let's implement the correct solution now:

```python

    # Count the occurrence of each x-coordinate
    x_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] += 1
    # The maximum number of points with the same x-coordinate
    return max(x_counts.values())

def solve_p2(points, N):
    MOD = 1000003
    # Count the occurrence of each x-coordinate
    x_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, _ in points:
        x_counts[x] += 1
    
    # Sort points by y-coordinate, then by x-coordinate
    points.sort(key=lambda point: (point[1], point[0]))

    triangles = 0
    # Iterate over all pairs of points with different y-coordinates
    for i in range(N - 1):

                third_points = N - (x_counts[points[i][0]] + x_counts[points[j][0]])
                triangles += third_points
                triangles %= MOD

    return triangles

def main():
    p, N, points = read_input('triunghiuri.in')
    if p == 1:
        result = solve_p1(points)
    elif p == 2:
        result = solve_p2(points, N)
    write_output('triunghiuri.out', result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This revised solution should now properly count the number of triangles according to the problem statement. It should generate the expected output for the provided input when you run it.
