Se consideră un automat de criptare format dintr-un tablou cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane, tablou ce conţine toate numerele de la $1$ la $n^2$ aşezate ”şerpuit” pe linii, de la prima la ultima linie, pe liniile impare pornind de la stânga către dreapta, iar pe cele pare de la dreapta către stânga (ca în figura alăturată).

~[cff5d8861bae938b2eed0dd1708a990c.png]

Numim ”amestecare“ operaţia de desfăşurare în spirală a valorilor din tablou în ordinea indicată de săgeţi şi de reaşezare a acestora în acelaşi tablou, ”şerpuit” pe linii ca şi în cazul precedent.

De exemplu, desfăşurarea tabloului conduce la şirul: $1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 12 \ 13 \ 14 \ 15 \ 16 \ 9 \ 8 \ 7 \ 6 \ 11 \ 10$, iar reaşezarea acestuia în tablou conduce la obţinerea unui nou tablou reprezentat în cea de-a doua figură alăturată.

~[dfa4ef22ee11881dd041cd3cb27af121.png]

După orice operaţie de amestecare se poate relua procedeul, efectuând o nouă amestecare. S-a observat un fapt interesant: că după un număr de amestecări, unele valori ajung din nou în poziţia iniţială (pe care o aveau în tabloul de pornire). De exemplu, după două amestecări, tabloul de $4 \cdot 4$ conţine $9$ dintre elementele sale în exact aceeaşi poziţie în care se aflau iniţial (vezi elemente marcate din figură).

~[d95634cea4aeffce07125a58f99b99a1.png]

# Cerinţă

Pentru $n$ şi $k$ citite, scrieţi un program care să determine numărul minim de amestecări ale unui tablou de n linii necesar pentru a ajunge la un tablou cu exact $k$ elemente aflate din nou în poziţia iniţială.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `spirala.in` conţine pe prima linie cele două numere $n$ şi $k$ despărţite printr-un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `spirala.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul de amestecări determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq N \leq 50$
* Datele de intrare sunt alese astfel încât numărul minim de amestecări necesare să nu depăşească $2 \cdot 10^9$

Since the environment does not support numpy, we need to rewrite the solution without using numpy or any other third-party libraries that are not part of the standard Python distribution. Here is the updated code:

```python
def create_serpentine_array(n):
    a = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    num = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                a[i][j] = num
            else:
                a[i][n-j-1] = num
            num += 1
    return a

def unravel_spiral(a, n):
    dx, dy = [0, 1, 0, -1], [1, 0, -1, 0]
    x, y, dir = 0, 0, 0
    seen = set()
    flat_indices = []
    for _ in range(n*n):
        flat_indices.append((x, y))
        seen.add((x, y))
        nx, ny = x + dx[dir], y + dy[dir]
        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in seen:
            x, y = nx, ny
        else:
            dir = (dir + 1) % 4
            x, y = x + dx[dir], y + dy[dir]
    return flat_indices

def find_min_mix(n, k):
    original = create_serpentine_array(n)
    original_positions = {val: idx for idx, row in enumerate(original) for val, idx in zip(row, range(n))}
    count = 0
    while True:
        count += 1
        current_positions = unravel_spiral(original, n)
        original = [[original[x][y] for y in range(n)] for x in range(n)]
        matches = sum(original[x][y] == (x * n + y + 1) for x, y in current_positions)
        if matches == k or count > 2 * 10**9:
            return count

def main():
    with open('spirala.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

    result = find_min_mix(n, k)

    with open('spirala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution does not use numpy and should run in an environment with only the standard Python library available. It reads from `spirala.in` and writes to `spirala.out` in accordance with the problem statement.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed because it exceeded the allowed memory usage or was manually killed by the system (often due to using too much memory). Since the memory limit for this task is ~8MB, we need to optimize the memory usage further.

Here's a revised version of the program to be more memory efficient, avoiding storing unnecessary data structures and simplifying the logic to minimize memory usage:

```python
def unravel_spiral(n, original_positions, pos_to_num):
    x, y, dx, dy = 0, 0, 0, 1
    spiral_order = []
    for _ in range(n * n):
        spiral_order.append(original_positions[(x, y)])
        # Check bounds and if the next position is already visited
        if not (0 <= x + dx < n and 0 <= y + dy < n and (x + dx, y + dy) not in spiral_order):
            # Change the direction
            dx, dy = dy, -dx
        x, y = x + dx, y + dy
    return [pos_to_num[idx] for idx in spiral_order]

def create_pos_to_num_mapping(n):
    pos_to_num = {}
    num = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                pos_to_num[(i, j)] = num
            else:
                pos_to_num[(i, n - j - 1)] = num
            num += 1
    return pos_to_num

def find_min_mix(n, k):
    pos_to_num = create_pos_to_num_mapping(n)
    original_positions = {v: k for k, v in pos_to_num.items()}
    count = 0
    while True:
        spiral_order = unravel_spiral(n, original_positions, pos_to_num)
        current_positions = {num: pos for pos, num in enumerate(spiral_order)}
        matches = sum(original_positions[i + 1] == current_positions[i + 1] for i in range(n * n))
        count += 1
        if matches == k or count > 2 * 10**9:
            break
    return count

def main():
    with open('spirala.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

    result = find_min_mix(n, k)

    with open('spirala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This version optimizes memory usage by eliminating the creation of 2D arrays and instead working with position-to-number mappings. It calculates the spiral order directly based on the original positions and uses a dictionary to keep track of the current positions after each mix. This should keep the memory usage within the specified limit.

The `KeyError: (0, 0)` indicates that when trying to access the key `(0, 0)` in the `original_positions` dictionary, the key is not found. The issue lies in how the `original_positions` dictionary is being constructed. We need to ensure that the keys match the positions used in the `unravel_spiral` function.

Here is the revised solution, with a fix to ensure that the keys in `original_positions` are set up correctly:

```python
def unravel_spiral(n):
    dx, dy = 0, 1  # Start direction to the right
    x, y = 0, 0
    spiral_order = []
    for _ in range(n * n):
        spiral_order.append((x, y))
        # Change direction if next move is out of bounds or already visited
        if not (0 <= x + dx < n and 0 <= y + dy < n) or (x + dx, y + dy) in spiral_order:
            dx, dy = dy, -dx  # Change direction
        x, y = x + dx, y + dy
    return spiral_order

def find_min_mix(n, k):
    original_spiral = unravel_spiral(n)
    original_positions = {pos: idx for idx, pos in enumerate(original_spiral)}
    count = 0
    while True:
        count += 1
        # Apply the spiral order to the positions
        new_positions = {original_spiral[(i + count) % (n*n)]: i for i in range(n*n)}
        # Count the matches
        matches = sum(original_positions[pos] == new_positions[pos] for pos in original_positions)
        if matches == k:
            return count
        if count > 2 * 10**9:  # Safeguard for the upper bound
            return -1

def main():
    with open('spirala.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

    result = find_min_mix(n, k)

    with open('spirala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This version no longer uses a dictionary to keep track of the original positions, but instead, it uses a list `original_spiral` to store the spiral order. The `original_positions` dictionary is then filled with the indices of the positions in the spiral order, fixing the KeyError problem. The `unravel_spiral` function is also simplified to return the spiral order directly. This code should now work correctly without encountering the KeyError.

Exit code 137 suggests that the program was terminated because it ran out of memory or was manually killed by the system for some reason like that. The previous solution may have exceeded the memory limit due to the list comprehensions and the extensive use of dictionaries, which are both memory-intensive operations. Since the memory limit is about 8MB, we need to be more careful about how we store and process the data.

Let's revise the solution, aiming to minimize memory usage and avoid storing large structures:

```python
def spiral_indices(n):
    # Generate the spiral indices without storing them
    x, y, dx, dy = 0, 0, 0, 1
    for _ in range(n * n):
        yield x, y
        if not (0 <= x + dx < n and 0 <= y + dy < n) or (dx != 0 and (x + dx, y) in seen) or (dy != 0 and (x, y + dy) in seen):
            dx, dy = dy, -dx
        x, y = x + dx, y + dy
        seen.add((x, y))

def get_initial_position(n, x, y):
    # Calculate the initial position of a number in the serpentine pattern
    return x * n + (y if x % 2 == 0 else n - 1 - y)

def find_min_mix(n, k):
    # Find the number of mixes to get k numbers back to their original position
    seen = set([(0, 0)])
    count = 0
    matches = 0
    for count in range(1, 2 * 10**9 + 1):
        new_positions = {get_initial_position(n, x, y): i for i, (x, y) in enumerate(spiral_indices(n))}
        matches = sum((new_positions[i] == i) for i in range(n * n))
        if matches == k:
            return count
    return -1

def main():
    with open('spirala.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

    result = find_min_mix(n, k)

    with open('spirala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this solution, the `spiral_indices` function is a generator that yields the spiral indices one by one without storing them in memory. The `get_initial_position` function calculates the initial position of a number based on its coordinates in the serpentine pattern without creating a mapping for all numbers.

The `find_min_mix` function has been updated to use these functions to calculate the new positions after each mix until `k` numbers have returned to their original position or the limit of `2 * 10**9` is reached.

Please try running this code to see if it fits the memory constraints.

The `NameError` indicates that the variable `seen` is not defined in the scope of the `spiral_indices` generator. This is because I overlooked passing the `seen` set to the generator function. Additionally, there's an issue of the `seen` set not being reset for each new count iteration. 

Let's rectify these issues and redefine the `spiral_indices` function. We'll also streamline the `find_min_mix` function to avoid building the entire dictionary, which should save memory. We will track the positions that have returned to their original place after each mix and stop once we reach `k` matches.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def spiral_indices(n, seen):
    # Generate the spiral indices without storing them
    x, y, dx, dy = 0, 0, 0, 1
    for _ in range(n * n):
        yield x, y
        if (x + dx, y + dy) in seen or not (0 <= x + dx < n and 0 <= y + dy < n):
            dx, dy = dy, -dx  # Change direction
        x, y = x + dx, y + dy
        seen.add((x, y))

def find_min_mix(n, k):
    # Find the number of mixes to get k numbers back to their original position
    for count in range(1, 2 * 10**9 + 1):
        seen = set([(0, 0)])
        matches = 0
        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(spiral_indices(n, seen)):
            # Calculate the initial position of a number in the serpentine pattern
            original_pos = x * n + (y if x % 2 == 0 else n - 1 - y)
            # Check if the number returned to its original position
            if original_pos == i:
                matches += 1
            if matches == k:
                return count
    return -1

def main():
    with open('spirala.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

    result = find_min_mix(n, k)

    with open('spirala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this corrected solution, we define and use `seen` within the `find_min_mix` function, ensuring it's appropriately scoped. The `spiral_indices` function now takes `seen` as an argument. We also calculate the matches on-the-fly without creating a new dictionary each time, which should help with memory usage.

This solution should now run within the given memory constraints without encountering the previous error.

The exit code 137 implies that the process was killed for using too much memory. To stay within the strict memory limit, we must avoid using any data structures that could grow with `n` and strictly control the memory allocation. In Python, sets and dictionaries can be particularly memory-intensive, so we will avoid using them, and instead, we will use a simple list to check whether an index has been visited in the spiral traversal.

Here's a revised solution that avoids the use of sets and calculates the original position more efficiently:

```python
def spiral_indices(n):
    # Generate the spiral indices without storing them
    x, y, dx, dy = 0, 0, 0, 1
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n * n):
        yield x, y
        visited[x][y] = True
        if not (0 <= x + dx < n and 0 <= y + dy < n) or visited[x + dx][y + dy]:
            dx, dy = dy, -dx  # Change direction
        x, y = x + dx, y + dy

def serpentine_index(n, x, y):
    # Calculate the index in the serpentine pattern without creating a map
    return x * n + (y if x % 2 == 0 else n - y - 1)

def find_min_mix(n, k):
    # Find the number of mixes to get k numbers back to their original position
    count = 0
    while True:
        count += 1
        matches = 0
        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(spiral_indices(n)):
            # Check if the number at (x, y) is at its original serpentine position
            if serpentine_index(n, x, y) == i:
                matches += 1
            if matches == k:
                return count
        # If no solution is found within the limit, return -1
        if count > 2 * 10**9:
            return -1

def main():
    with open('spirala.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

    result = find_min_mix(n, k)

    with open('spirala.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this update, I've replaced the set `seen` with a 2D list `visited` to keep track of the cells that have been visited during the spiral traversal. We also calculate the index directly in the `serpentine_index` function without the need for a mapping or additional memory allocation.

Please try this solution and see if it meets the memory requirements.
