Se consideră un automat de criptare format dintr-un tablou cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane, tablou ce conţine toate numerele de la $1$ la $n^2$ aşezate ”şerpuit” pe linii, de la prima la ultima linie, pe liniile impare pornind de la stânga către dreapta, iar pe cele pare de la dreapta către stânga (ca în figura alăturată).

~[cff5d8861bae938b2eed0dd1708a990c.png]

Numim ”amestecare“ operaţia de desfăşurare în spirală a valorilor din tablou în ordinea indicată de săgeţi şi de reaşezare a acestora în acelaşi tablou, ”şerpuit” pe linii ca şi în cazul precedent.

De exemplu, desfăşurarea tabloului conduce la şirul: $1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 12 \ 13 \ 14 \ 15 \ 16 \ 9 \ 8 \ 7 \ 6 \ 11 \ 10$, iar reaşezarea acestuia în tablou conduce la obţinerea unui nou tablou reprezentat în cea de-a doua figură alăturată.

După orice operaţie de amestecare se poate relua procedeul, efectuând o nouă amestecare. S-a observat un fapt interesant: că după un număr de amestecări, unele valori ajung din nou în poziţia iniţială (pe care o aveau în tabloul de pornire). De exemplu, după două amestecări, tabloul de $4 \cdot 4$ conţine $9$ dintre elementele sale în exact aceeaşi poziţie în care se aflau iniţial (vezi elemente marcate din figură).

# Cerinţă

Pentru $n$ şi $k$ citite, scrieţi un program care să determine numărul minim de amestecări ale unui tablou de n linii necesar pentru a ajunge la un tablou cu exact $k$ elemente aflate din nou în poziţia iniţială.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `spirala.in` conţine pe prima linie cele două numere $n$ şi $k$ despărţite printr-un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `spirala.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul de amestecări determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $3 \leq N \leq 50$
* Datele de intrare sunt alese astfel încât numărul minim de amestecări necesare să nu depăşească $2 \cdot 10^9$

It appears that the system where the code is being executed does not have the `numpy` library installed. Given that `numpy` is typically used for efficient numerical computations and array manipulations, not having it could significantly impact the ability to optimize for both time and memory. 

Since we have a memory limit and cannot use `numpy`, we will have to implement the solution using standard Python data structures. We will use lists for matrix manipulation and optimize the algorithm to use minimal extra memory.

Here is the revised solution without using `numpy`: 

```python
# Function to perform the 'amestecare' operation
def amestecare(matrix, n):
    spiral = []
    top, bottom, left, right = 0, n, 0, n
    direction = 0  # 0: left to right, 1: bottom to top, 2: right to left, 3: top to bottom

    while top < bottom and left < right:
        if direction == 0:
            for i in range(left, right):
                spiral.append(matrix[top][i])
            top += 1
        elif direction == 1:
            for i in range(top, bottom):
                spiral.append(matrix[i][right - 1])
            right -= 1
        elif direction == 2:
            for i in range(right - 1, left - 1, -1):
                spiral.append(matrix[bottom - 1][i])
            bottom -= 1
        elif direction == 3:
            for i in range(bottom - 1, top - 1, -1):
                spiral.append(matrix[i][left])
            left += 1
        direction = (direction + 1) % 4

    new_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    idx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n):
                new_matrix[i][j] = spiral[idx]
                idx += 1
        else:
            for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                new_matrix[i][j] = spiral[idx]
                idx += 1

    return new_matrix

# Read input from file
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Initial matrix creation
matrix = [[(i * n + j + 1) for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
initial_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]

# Find the minimum number of mixings
mix_count = 0
while True:
    mix_count += 1
    matrix = amestecare(matrix, n)
    matching_elements = sum(matrix[i][j] == initial_matrix[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n))
    if matching_elements >= k:
        break

# Write output to file
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(mix_count))
```

This solution should be more compatible as it only uses built-in Python data structures and functions, while still striving to be efficient in terms of both time and memory usage.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed by the system, usually due to using too much memory. Since the program has a memory limit of ~8MB and we're dealing with potentially large matrices (up to 50x50), we need to optimize the memory usage further.

Given that the task is to count the number of positions that return to their original place after each spiral operation, we can optimize our program by avoiding the creation of a full matrix each time. Instead, we can calculate the new position for each number after a spiral operation.

Let's rewrite the solution with these optimizations to reduce memory usage:

```python
# Function to calculate the new position of a number in the matrix after the amestecare operation
def new_position(pos, n):
    layers = (min(pos % n, n - (pos % n) - 1, pos // n, n - (pos // n) - 1))
    side_len = n - 2 * layers
    pos -= (n * n - side_len * side_len)
    max_pos = 4 * (side_len - 1)
    pos = (pos + max_pos - layers) % max_pos
    if pos < side_len - 1:
        return (layers, layers + pos)
    pos -= side_len - 1
    if pos < side_len - 1:
        return (layers + pos, n - layers - 1)
    pos -= side_len - 1
    if pos < side_len - 1:
        return (n - layers - 1, n - layers - pos - 1)
    pos -= side_len - 1
    return (n - layers - pos - 1, layers)

# Read input from file
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Calculate the initial positions of numbers
initial_positions = {i: (i // n, i % n) for i in range(n * n)}

# Initialize counters for the number of mixings and matching elements
mix_count = 0
matching_elements = 0

# Perform the mixing until k elements are back to their original position
while matching_elements < k:
    mix_count += 1
    new_positions = {}
    matching_elements = 0
    
    for number, position in initial_positions.items():
        new_position_number = new_position(number, n)
        new_positions[number] = new_position_number
        if new_position_number == position:
            matching_elements += 1
    
    initial_positions = new_positions

# Write output to file
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(mix_count))
```

In this version of the program, we calculate the positions directly, thus avoiding creating a matrix and only storing the necessary positions. This should drastically reduce memory usage and avoid the previous memory issues.

The issue with the previous implementation is that it does not take into account the correct behavior of the amestecare operation. The implementation incorrectly assumes that each number moves in a fixed pattern, which is not the case. The spiral operation actually moves numbers in a more complex way, depending on their initial position in the matrix.

One possible solution to this problem is to simulate the spiral operation directly, by following the indices of the matrix as they would move in a spiral, and then checking whether those indices have returned to their original positions. However, this simulation should be done in a memory-efficient way, such that we don't create a new matrix each time.

Let's try a new implementation, using a dictionary to track the position of each element after each spiral operation, and an efficient way to simulate the spiral without generating an entire matrix each time. This approach keeps track of the elements that have returned to their initial position, allowing us to stop as soon as we reach the desired `k` elements.

Here is the revised implementation:

```python
# Calculate the spiral sequence of positions for a matrix of size n x n
def spiral_sequence(n):
    sequence = []
    x, y = 0, 0
    dx, dy = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n * n):
        if (0 <= x + dx < n) and (0 <= y + dy < n) and not (x + dx, y + dy) in sequence:
            x, y = x + dx, y + dy
        else:
            dx, dy = dy, -dx
            x, y = x + dx, y + dy
        sequence.append((x, y))
    return sequence

# Function to calculate the number of mixings
def calculate_mixings(n, k):
    mix_count = 0
    sequence = spiral_sequence(n)
    positions = {sequence[i]: i for i in range(n*n)}
    current = {i: i for i in range(n*n)}
    while True:
        mix_count += 1
        current = {i: positions[current[i]] for i in range(n*n)}
        matching_elements = sum(1 for i in range(n*n) if current[i] == i)
        if matching_elements >= k:
            break
    return mix_count

# Read input from file
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of mixings
mix_count = calculate_mixings(n, k)

# Write output to file
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(mix_count))
```

This revised solution uses a function `spiral_sequence` to calculate the sequence of positions that numbers will be moved to in each spiral operation. We then use this sequence to simulate the movement of each number in the matrix. We keep track of the current position of each number in the `current` dictionary and update it according to the spiral sequence after each mixing until we reach the desired number of matching elements.

This approach should work correctly and efficiently for the given input size and constraints.

The error indicates a `KeyError: 0`, which means that when attempting to access `positions[current[i]]`, the key `current[i]` does not exist in the `positions` dictionary. This suggests that there's an issue with the mapping of positions during the spiral movement.

The problem in the code lies in the fact that the `spiral_sequence` is creating a sequence of spatial positions (x, y), but when calculating the mixings, we are treating these as indices without converting them back to the linear index form that would match the `current` dictionary.

To fix this, we need to adjust the `calculate_mixings` function to correctly index into `positions` using the linear index of the current position, not the spatial position. We need to convert the spatial (x, y) positions back to linear indices when updating `current`.

Let's rewrite the `calculate_mixings` function to address this issue:

```python
def calculate_mixings(n, k):
    mix_count = 0
    sequence = spiral_sequence(n)
    positions = {sequence[i]: i for i in range(n*n)}
    current = {i: i for i in range(n*n)}
    
    while True:
        mix_count += 1
        current = {i: positions[sequence[current[i]]] for i in range(n*n)}
        matching_elements = sum(1 for i in range(n*n) if current[i] == i)
        if matching_elements >= k:
            break
    
    return mix_count

# Read input from file
with open('spirala.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of mixings
mix_count = calculate_mixings(n, k)

# Write output to file
with open('spirala.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(mix_count))
```

In this revised version, the `current` dictionary is updated using the linear index `sequence[current[i]]` to correctly reference the new position after the spiral movement. This should avoid the `KeyError` and correctly calculate the number of mixings required to have `k` elements back in their original positions. This solution should now work correctly for the given constraints.
