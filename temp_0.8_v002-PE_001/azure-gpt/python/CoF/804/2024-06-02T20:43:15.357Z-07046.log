Ion Petre, ca oricare adolescent, este pasionat atât de jocuri, cât şi de informatică. Ultimul astfel de joc este acela de a elimina dintr-un text cuvinte astfel încât fiecare cuvânt rămas să fie urmat de un cuvânt care începe cu aceeaşi literă cu care se termină cuvântul precedent. Face excepţie de la această regulă numai ultimul cuvânt.

# Cerinţă

Pentru un text dat:
1) afișați numărul **minim** de cuvinte ce pot fi eliminate astfel încât în textul rămas orice cuvânt (cu excepţia ultimului) să se termine cu aceeaşi literă cu care începe cuvântul următor;
2) afișați numărul de cuvinte din text;
3) afișați cuvintele din text rămase după eliminarea de la prima cerință, fiecare cuvânt fiind afişat pe câte o linie.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul `text.in` conţine un text scris pe mai multe linii. Pe fiecare linie se află cuvinte formate din litere mici ale alfabetului latin. Cuvintele sunt despărţite între ele prin exact câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `text.out` va conţine pe primele doua linii două numerele $x$ şi $y$, unde $x$ va fi numărul minim de cuvinte ce trebuie eliminate, iar $y$ numărul de cuvinte din text. Pe liniile următoare se vor afişa, în ordine, cuvintele rămase după eliminarea celor $y$ cuvinte, câte un cuvant pe o linie.

# Restricții și precizări

*	Numărul de cuvinte din text este maximum $20 \ 000$.
*	Lungimea maximă a unui cuvânt este $20$.
*	Fiecare linie de text din fişierul de intrare are cel mult $200$ de caractere.
*	În fişierul de intrare pot exista rânduri goale.
*	Se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe.
*	Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru rezolvarea corectă a primelor două cerinţe.
*	Pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă tot punctajul.
*   **Notă**: exemplul de pe PDF este afișat în mod invers față de cum este afișat în teste.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. This means we either need to remove the dependency on `numpy` and write a pure Python solution or ensure that `numpy` is installed in the runtime environment, which we cannot control in this setting.

Since we have a memory limitation and should optimize for both time and memory, it's crucial to write an efficient pure Python solution. Given that constraint, I'll implement the solution without using `numpy` or any other non-standard library.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Define a function to determine if a word can follow another
def can_follow(word1, word2):
    return word1[-1] == word2[0]

# Read the input file
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = file.read().split()

# Count the total number of words
total_words = len(words)

# Initialize the graph
graph = {i: [] for i in range(total_words)}

# Build the graph
for i in range(total_words):
    for j in range(i + 1, total_words):
        if can_follow(words[i], words[j]):
            graph[i].append(j)
            graph[j].append(i)  # For undirected graph

# Perform DFS to find the longest path
def dfs(vertex, graph, visited, path):
    visited.add(vertex)
    current_path = path + [vertex]
    longest_path = current_path
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            candidate_path = dfs(neighbor, graph, visited.copy(), current_path)
            if len(candidate_path) > len(longest_path):
                longest_path = candidate_path
    return longest_path

# Find the longest path in the graph
best_path = []
for i in range(total_words):
    visited = set()
    current_path = dfs(i, graph, visited, [])
    if len(current_path) > len(best_path):
        best_path = current_path

# Calculate the number of words to remove
words_to_remove = total_words - len(best_path)

# Write output to the file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{words_to_remove}\n{total_words}\n')
    for index in best_path:
        file.write(f'{words[index]}\n')
```

This solution does not use any external libraries and should meet the memory and time constraints mentioned in the problem statement. The DFS approach may not be the most optimized for large input sizes, but given the constraints (maximum 20,000 words), it should work within reasonable limits. If further optimization is needed, we can consider more advanced algorithms such as dynamic programming or heuristics tailored for this problem.

The previous solution seems to have a bug in the DFS search for the longest path which results in an incorrect sequence of words. Specifically, the DFS is not guaranteed to find the longest path in a graph due to its nature of exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

To fix this issue, we should utilize a more appropriate algorithm to find the longest path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, the graph we have is not necessarily a DAG due to potential cycles. To address this and work within the constraints, we can attempt a greedy approach that iterates through the words and constructs the longest possible sequence by always picking the next word that follows the rule and has not been used yet.

Let's rewrite the solution with a new approach:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = file.read().split()

# Count the total number of words
total_words = len(words)

# Helper function to get the next word index which has the same starting letter as the ending letter of the current word
def get_next_word_index(current_word, used_words):
    last_letter = current_word[-1]
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        if not used_words[i] and word[0] == last_letter:
            return i
    return None

# Find the longest sequence starting with each word
used_words = [False] * total_words
sequence = []
sequence_indices = []

for i in range(total_words):
    current_index = i
    current_sequence = [words[current_index]]
    current_sequence_indices = [current_index]
    used_words[current_index] = True
    
    while True:
        next_index = get_next_word_index(words[current_index], used_words)
        if next_index is not None:
            used_words[next_index] = True
            current_sequence.append(words[next_index])
            current_sequence_indices.append(next_index)
            current_index = next_index
        else:
            break
    
    if len(current_sequence) > len(sequence):
        sequence = current_sequence
        sequence_indices = current_sequence_indices

# Calculate the number of words to remove
words_to_remove = total_words - len(sequence)

# Write output to the file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{words_to_remove}\n{total_words}\n')
    for index in sequence_indices:
        file.write(f'{words[index]}\n')
```

This greedy algorithm iteratively builds sequences by selecting unused words that can follow the current word. If the rule cannot be satisfied, it breaks the loop and tries to build a sequence from the next word. This approach ensures that the given rule is always followed and tries to build the longest possible sequence. The solution keeps track of the best (longest) sequence found and outputs it.

The output is not as expected because the greedy approach used in the last solution doesn't guarantee the longest path in the word sequence graph. This is because choosing the next word in sequence without considering the entire path ahead can lead to suboptimal solutions.

To solve this, we need to use a more sophisticated approach that considers all possible paths. Given the computational complexity of finding the longest path in a general graph (which is NP-hard), we need to use a dynamic programming approach where we save the longest path that can be achieved starting with each word and then build upon it.

Let's re-implement the solution using dynamic programming:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('text.in', 'r') as file:
    words = file.read().split()

# Count the total number of words
total_words = len(words)

# Helper function to get the indices of words that can follow the current word
def get_following_words_indices(last_letter, start_index, used_words):
    return [i for i, word in enumerate(words[start_index:], start=start_index)
            if word[0] == last_letter and not used_words[i]]

# Initialize DP table; Each entry will hold the longest path starting at that word
dp = [[] for _ in range(total_words)]

# Populate DP table with the longest paths
for i in range(total_words - 1, -1, -1):
    following_indices = get_following_words_indices(words[i][-1], i + 1, [False] * total_words)
    if not following_indices:  # If there are no following words, this is a single-word path
        dp[i] = [i]
    else:
        # Find the following word that leads to the longest path
        longest_following_path = max((dp[j] for j in following_indices), key=len)
        dp[i] = [i] + longest_following_path

# Find the overall longest path from the DP table
longest_path_indices = max(dp, key=len)

# Calculate the number of words to remove
words_to_remove = total_words - len(longest_path_indices)

# Write output to the file
with open('text.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{words_to_remove}\n{total_words}\n')
    for index in longest_path_indices:
        file.write(f'{words[index]}\n')
```

This dynamic programming solution works by iterating over the words in reverse. For each word, it finds all possible following words and chooses the one that gives the longest path. Finally, it finds the longest path among all starting points and outputs that as the result. This solution should give the correct sequence that minimizes the number of words removed and respects the rules of the game.
