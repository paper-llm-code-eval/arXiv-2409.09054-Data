Graniţa nu se trece uşor. Asta pentru că Balaurul Arhirel (mare pasionat de informatică) nu lasă pe nimeni să treacă decât după ce răspunde la nişte întrebări...

În acea ţară există $3$ tipuri de perle normale (le vom nota cu $1$, $2$ şi $3$) şi $3$ tipuri de perle magice (le vom nota cu $A$, $B$ şi $C$). Perlele magice sunt deosebite prin faptul că se pot transforma în alte perle (una sau mai multe, normale sau magice):
- Perla magică de tipul $A$ se poate transforma în orice perlă normală (una singură);
- Perla magică de tipul $B$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $B$, sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una magică de tipul $A$, una normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $A$ şi una magică de tipul $C$;
- Perla magică de tipul $C$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $B$ şi una magică de tipul $C$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $A$.

Ca să rezumăm cele de mai sus putem scrie:
```
A -> 1  | 2     | 3
B -> 2B | 1A3AC
C -> 2  | 3BC   | 12A
```

Balaurul Arhirel ne lasă la început să ne alegem o perlă magică (una singură), iar apoi folosind numai transformările de mai sus trebuie să obţinem un anumit şir de perle normale. Când o perlă magică se transformă, perlele din stânga şi din dreapta ei rămân la fel (şi în aceeaşi ordine). De asemenea ordinea perlelor rezultate din transformare este chiar cea prezentată mai sus.

De exemplu, dacă balaurul ne cere să facem şirul de perle `21132123`, putem alege o perlă magică de tipul $B$ şi următorul şir de transformări: `B -> 2B -> 21A3AC -> 21A3A12A -> 21132123`.

Întrucât Balaurul nu are prea multă răbdare, el nu ne cere decât să spunem dacă se poate sau nu obţine şirul respectiv de perle.

# Cerință

Să se determine pentru fiecare şir de intrare dacă se poate obţine prin transformările de mai sus sau nu (alegând orice primă perlă magică, la fiecare şir).

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `perle.in` are următoarea structură:
* Pe prima linie numărul $N$, reprezentând numărul de şiruri din fişierul de intrare;
* Urmează $N$ linii; a $i$-a linie dintre cele $N$ descrie şirul $i$, printr-o succesiune de numere naturale despărţite de câte un spaţiu. Primul număr reprezintă lungimea şirului $L_i$, iar următoarele $L_i$ numere sunt tipurile de perle normale, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `perle.out` va conţine $N$ linii. Pe linia $i$ se va scrie un singur număr $1$ sau $0$ ($1$ dacă se poate obţine şirul respectiv (al $i$-lea) şi $0$ dacă nu se poate).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq L_i \leq 10 \ 000$, pentru oricare $i$;

Below is the corrected solution, which reads from `perle.in` and writes to `perle.out` without using `input()` or `print()`:

The error is caused by the fact that f-strings in Python cannot include backslashes directly within the curly braces. I will correct the code by using string concatenation to avoid this problem:

```python
import numpy as np

# Function to check if a sequence can be generated
def can_generate(seq):
    # Count the occurrences of pearls 1, 2, and 3
    count_1 = np.count_nonzero(seq == 1)

    count_3 = np.count_nonzero(seq == 3)
    
    # Since each transformation preserves the parity of the count of pearls 1, 2, and 3,
    # we check the parity of their counts to determine if the sequence is possible to generate
    return (count_1 % 2) == (count_2 % 2) == (count_3 % 2)

# Read the number of sequences and the sequences from input file

    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = [np.array(list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()[1:])), dtype=np.int8) for _ in range(N)]

# Check for each sequence if it can be generated or not, and write the result to the output file

The error indicates that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the provided restrictions include a memory limit, it's probable that using a third-party library like `numpy` may not be allowed for this challenge. We need to solve the problem without depending on `numpy` or any other external library.

Here is the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Read the number of sequences and the sequences from input file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()[1:])) for _ in range(N)]

# Function to check if a sequence can be generated
def can_generate(seq):
    # Count the occurrences of pearls 1, 2, and 3
    count_1 = seq.count(1)
    count_2 = seq.count(2)
    count_3 = seq.count(3)
    
    # Since each transformation preserves the parity of the count of pearls 1, 2, and 3,
    # we check the parity of their counts to determine if the sequence is possible to generate
    return (count_1 % 2) == (count_2 % 2) == (count_3 % 2)

# Check for each sequence if it can be generated or not, and write the result to the output file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for seq in sequences:
        file.write('1\n' if can_generate(seq) else '0\n')
```

This solution should solve the problem within the memory limit and without relying on any third-party libraries.

The results differ because my previous implementation incorrectly assumed that the parity of the counts of pearls 1, 2, and 3 would be preserved through the transformations given. However, pearl B can turn into an odd or even number of pearls (2B or 1A3AC), and pearl C can turn into an even number of pearls (2 or 3BC or 12A), which does not always preserve the parity of pearl counts.

Let's try to solve the problem with a different approach. We know that:

1. Pearl A can turn into a single pearl of any normal type.
2. Pearl B can replicate itself indefinitely (since B can turn into 2B), and it can generate pearl 2 as well.
3. Pearl C can also replicate itself indefinitely (since C can turn into 3BC), and it can generate both pearls 2 and 3.

Given that both B and C can replicate themselves, if a sequence has an even count of all types of pearls, it can be generated starting with B or C because they can create a sequence of even length. If a sequence has an odd count, we can start with an A and then follow with a B or C to generate the rest of the sequence.

Let's now re-implement the solution with this approach:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be generated
def can_generate(seq):
    # Count the occurrences of pearls 1, 2, and 3
    count_1 = seq.count(1)
    count_2 = seq.count(2)
    count_3 = seq.count(3)
    
    # Check if all counts are even, in which case B or C can generate the sequence
    if count_1 % 2 == count_2 % 2 == count_3 % 2 == 0:
        return True
    # Check if the counts are odd, in which case A followed by B or C can generate the sequence
    elif count_1 % 2 == count_2 % 2 == count_3 % 2 == 1:
        return True
    # Otherwise, the sequence cannot be generated
    else:
        return False

# Read the number of sequences and the sequences from input file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()[1:])) for _ in range(N)]

# Check for each sequence if it can be generated or not, and write the result to the output file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for seq in sequences:
        file.write('1\n' if can_generate(seq) else '0\n')
```

This implementation should yield the correct results.

After reviewing the results and the provided transformations, I have determined that the logic in the previous implementations was not correctly capturing the rules of the pearl transformations. The transformation rules allow for the creation of additional magic pearls, which can subsequently transform into normal pearls. This means we have to take into account the ability to generate sequences based on whether they can be created starting with a single magical pearl.

Given that:
- Magic pearl A can turn into any single normal pearl.
- Magic pearl B can turn into a sequence with an even number of type 2 pearls (due to "2B -> 2B").
- Magic pearl C can turn into a sequence with an even number of type 2 and type 3 pearls (due to "3BC -> 3BC").

The strategy will be to check if the sequence can be generated starting with a single magic pearl. For that, we need to ensure that:
- There is an even number of pearls 2 and 3 if the sequence is longer than 1 (since B and C can only create pairs of pearls, 2 or 3 respectively).
- If the sequence is a single pearl, it can always be generated by magic pearl A.

Let's re-implement the solution with this corrected approach:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be generated
def can_generate(seq):
    # Count the occurrences of pearls 1, 2, and 3
    count_1 = seq.count(1)
    count_2 = seq.count(2)
    count_3 = seq.count(3)

    # Check if the sequence consists of a single pearl, which can be generated by magic pearl A
    if len(seq) == 1:
        return True

    # If the sequence is longer, check if there is an even number of pearls 2 and 3
    return count_2 % 2 == 0 and count_3 % 2 == 0

# Read the number of sequences and the sequences from input file
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = []
    for _ in range(N):
        length, *seq = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        sequences.append(seq)

# Check for each sequence if it can be generated or not, and write the result to the output file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for seq in sequences:
        file.write('1\n' if can_generate(seq) else '0\n')
```

This should now correctly identify the sequences that can be generated according to the transformation rules.
