Graniţa nu se trece uşor. Asta pentru că Balaurul Arhirel (mare pasionat de informatică) nu lasă pe nimeni să treacă decât după ce răspunde la nişte întrebări...

În acea ţară există $3$ tipuri de perle normale (le vom nota cu $1$, $2$ şi $3$) şi $3$ tipuri de perle magice (le vom nota cu $A$, $B$ şi $C$). Perlele magice sunt deosebite prin faptul că se pot transforma în alte perle (una sau mai multe, normale sau magice):
- Perla magică de tipul $A$ se poate transforma în orice perlă normală (una singură);
- Perla magică de tipul $B$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $B$, sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una magică de tipul $A$, una normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $A$ şi una magică de tipul $C$;
- Perla magică de tipul $C$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $B$ şi una magică de tipul $C$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $A$.

Ca să rezumăm cele de mai sus putem scrie:
```
A -> 1  | 2     | 3
B -> 2B | 1A3AC
C -> 2  | 3BC   | 12A
```

Balaurul Arhirel ne lasă la început să ne alegem o perlă magică (una singură), iar apoi folosind numai transformările de mai sus trebuie să obţinem un anumit şir de perle normale. Când o perlă magică se transformă, perlele din stânga şi din dreapta ei rămân la fel (şi în aceeaşi ordine). De asemenea ordinea perlelor rezultate din transformare este chiar cea prezentată mai sus.

De exemplu, dacă balaurul ne cere să facem şirul de perle `21132123`, putem alege o perlă magică de tipul $B$ şi următorul şir de transformări: `B -> 2B -> 21A3AC -> 21A3A12A -> 21132123`.

Întrucât Balaurul nu are prea multă răbdare, el nu ne cere decât să spunem dacă se poate sau nu obţine şirul respectiv de perle.

# Cerință

Să se determine pentru fiecare şir de intrare dacă se poate obţine prin transformările de mai sus sau nu (alegând orice primă perlă magică, la fiecare şir).

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `perle.in` are următoarea structură:
* Pe prima linie numărul $N$, reprezentând numărul de şiruri din fişierul de intrare;
* Urmează $N$ linii; a $i$-a linie dintre cele $N$ descrie şirul $i$, printr-o succesiune de numere naturale despărţite de câte un spaţiu. Primul număr reprezintă lungimea şirului $L_i$, iar următoarele $L_i$ numere sunt tipurile de perle normale, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `perle.out` va conţine $N$ linii. Pe linia $i$ se va scrie un singur număr $1$ sau $0$ ($1$ dacă se poate obţine şirul respectiv (al $i$-lea) şi $0$ dacă nu se poate).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq L_i \leq 10 \ 000$, pentru oricare $i$;

The previous implementation has a logical error. It incorrectly assumes that it is sufficient to only check the parity of pearls of type 1 and 3, which is not true considering the complex transformations that can occur for each magic pearl. We need to devise a more accurate algorithm to verify whether a given sequence can be obtained from the transformations.

Upon reviewing the problem, we can notice that:
- Every magic pearl can become a normal pearl type 2, so counts of pearl type 2 do not constrain the solution.
- Magic pearl B and C can produce each other, so we do not need to consider the balance of the initial magic pearl chosen.
- The number of pearl type 1 and 3 must be balanced or have an extra type 3 (since type A magic pearl can convert into either 1 or 3).

Based on these observations, here is the corrected algorithm and solution:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be formed
def can_form_sequence(sequence):
    # Counter for normal pearls
    count = [0, 0, 0]

    # Count the occurrences of each type of normal pearl
    for pearl in sequence:
        count[int(pearl) - 1] += 1

    # A magic pearl can transform into type 1 or 3, so if we have more type 1
    # than type 3, it is impossible to balance the count using only type A pearls.
    # Also, if the difference is more than 1, it's impossible to balance them
    # considering that a type B pearl can produce one more type 1 and a type C
    # pearl can produce one more type 3.
    # Hence, the sequence is possible if there are equal or one more type 3 than type 1,
    # regardless of type 2 as it can be easily produced by all magic pearls.
    return count[2] >= count[0] and count[2] - count[0] <= 1

# Read input from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = [file.readline().strip().split() for _ in range(N)]

# Prepare output for 'perle.out'
results = []

# Check if each sequence can be formed and store result
for seq in sequences:
    seq_length = int(seq[0])
    sequence = seq[1:]
    results.append(int(can_form_sequence(sequence)))

# Write output to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:

Upon careful reconsideration of the problem, we need a new approach that better reflects the transformation rules given for the magic pearls:

- Magic pearl A can become any normal pearl, so it doesn't impose any constraint.
- Magic pearl B can replicate itself while also producing a type 2 pearl, and can also produce a sequence of 1A3AC, meaning it can effectively provide any number of type 2 pearls while also affecting the balance of type 1 and type 3 pearls.
- Magic pearl C can become a type 2 pearl, or a sequence of 3BC, or a sequence of 12A, thus also affecting the balance of type 1 and type 3.

Since B and C can replicate themselves, the initial choice of magic pearl doesn't impose a constraint. However, we need to ensure that the transformations can produce a balanced number of type 1 and type 3 pearls, given that we can always produce enough type 2 pearls.

A correct approach involves tracking if we can balance type 1 and type 3 pearls after choosing each type of magic pearl initially. It's possible to form the sequence if we can balance these pearls after choosing either:

- only A pearls initially,
- only B pearls initially,
- only C pearls initially,
- or a combination of B and C pearls initially, since they can transform into each other.

The only time we cannot form the sequence is when we have an excess of type 1 pearls that cannot be compensated by transforming A into type 3 pearls, or when we have more than one extra type 3 pearl, which we cannot balance out with the transformations.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be formed
def can_form_sequence(sequence):
    # Counter for normal pearls
    count = [0, 0, 0]

    # Count the occurrences of each type of normal pearl
    for pearl in sequence:
        count[int(pearl) - 1] += 1

    # The sequence is possible if the number of type 1 pearls does not exceed
    # the number of type 3 pearls, and the excess of type 3 over type 1
    # is not more than 1, since we can use A to convert into type 3 if needed.
    return count[0] <= count[2] and count[2] - count[0] <= 1

# Read input from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = [file.readline().strip().split() for _ in range(N)]

# Check if each sequence can be formed and store result
results = []
for seq in sequences:
    seq_length = int(seq[0])
    sequence = seq[1:]
    results.append(int(can_form_sequence(sequence)))

# Write output to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

With this logic, the program should produce the correct output for the given input.

The algorithm still seems to have a logical issue in terms of determining if a sequence can be achieved. To solve this problem correctly, we need to take into account the rules for transforming magic pearls.

Given a string of pearls, we need to ensure that the number of type 1 and type 3 pearls are such that transformation from magic pearls can resolve any imbalances. The rules are as follows:

- A magic pearl of type A can turn into any one of the normal pearls (1, 2, 3), so it does not impose any constraint on the balance.
- A magic pearl of type B can turn into a sequence that has an equal number of type 1 and type 3 pearls, so it can be ignored for the balance of type 1 and type 3.
- A magic pearl of type C can turn into a sequence with one more type 3 than type 1.

Considering this, we can only achieve a sequence if the number of type 3 pearls is greater than or equal to the number of type 1 pearls, and the difference is at most 1. This is because we could start with a type C magic pearl and keep transforming it until the balance is correct.

Let's implement this logic in the solution:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be formed
def can_form_sequence(sequence):
    # Counter for normal pearls
    count = [0, 0, 0]

    # Count the occurrences of each type of normal pearl
    for pearl in sequence:
        count[int(pearl) - 1] += 1

    # The sequence is possible if the number of type 1 pearls does not exceed
    # the number of type 3 pearls, and the difference must be at most 1.
    return count[0] <= count[2] and count[2] - count[0] <= 1

# Read input from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = [file.readline().strip().split() for _ in range(N)]

# Check if each sequence can be formed and store result
results = []
for seq in sequences:
    seq_length = int(seq[0])
    sequence = seq[1:]
    results.append(int(can_form_sequence(sequence)))

# Write output to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

Now, this solution should reflect the correct logic for converting magic pearls and determining whether a sequence can be formed, thus producing the expected output.

The previous solutions have not accurately applied the transformation rules provided. To solve this problem, we need to consider all the transformation possibilities for the magic pearls and determine if we can obtain the target sequence of normal pearls.

Let's analyze the transformation rules again:

1. Any sequence that has more type 2 pearls than the sum of type 1 and type 3 pearls combined cannot be formed because no transformation results in two type 2 pearls without producing other types.
2. The transformations can produce either balanced or unbalanced pairs of type 1 and type 3 pearls, so if there are more type 1 pearls than type 3 pearls in the target sequence, it cannot be formed.
3. Given that transformations from magic pearls B and C can result in more type 3 pearls, a sequence can only be formed if it has at least as many type 3 pearls as type 1 pearls, and at most one more type 3 pearl than type 1 pearls.

Based on this analysis, we can re-implement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be formed
def can_form_sequence(sequence):
    count_1 = 0
    count_2 = 0
    count_3 = 0

    # Count the occurrences of each type of normal pearl
    for pearl in sequence:
        if pearl == '1':
            count_1 += 1
        elif pearl == '2':
            count_2 += 1
        elif pearl == '3':
            count_3 += 1

    # Check if the sequence can be formed with the transformation rules
    # Rule 1: There must not be more type 2 pearls than the sum of type 1 and type 3 pearls
    # Rule 3: There must be at least as many type 3 pearls as type 1 pearls
    # Rule 3: There cannot be more than one additional type 3 pearl compared to type 1 pearls
    return count_2 <= count_1 + count_3 and count_3 >= count_1 and (count_3 - count_1) <= 1

# Read input from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequences = [file.readline().strip().split() for _ in range(N)]

# Process each sequence and store the results
results = []
for i in range(N):
    seq_length, *sequence = sequences[i]
    results.append(int(can_form_sequence(sequence)))

# Write output to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly determine whether a sequence can be formed with the magic pearls' transformation rules and produce the expected output.
