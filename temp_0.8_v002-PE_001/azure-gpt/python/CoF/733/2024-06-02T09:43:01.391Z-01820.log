Graniţa nu se trece uşor. Asta pentru că Balaurul Arhirel (mare pasionat de informatică) nu lasă pe nimeni să treacă decât după ce răspunde la nişte întrebări...

În acea ţară există $3$ tipuri de perle normale (le vom nota cu $1$, $2$ şi $3$) şi $3$ tipuri de perle magice (le vom nota cu $A$, $B$ şi $C$). Perlele magice sunt deosebite prin faptul că se pot transforma în alte perle (una sau mai multe, normale sau magice):
- Perla magică de tipul $A$ se poate transforma în orice perlă normală (una singură);
- Perla magică de tipul $B$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $B$, sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una magică de tipul $A$, una normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $A$ şi una magică de tipul $C$;
- Perla magică de tipul $C$ se poate transforma într-o perlă normală de tipul $2$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $3$, una magică de tipul $B$ şi una magică de tipul $C$ sau într-o perlă normală de tipul $1$, una normală de tipul $2$ şi una magică de tipul $A$.

Ca să rezumăm cele de mai sus putem scrie:
```
A -> 1  | 2     | 3
B -> 2B | 1A3AC
C -> 2  | 3BC   | 12A
```

Balaurul Arhirel ne lasă la început să ne alegem o perlă magică (una singură), iar apoi folosind numai transformările de mai sus trebuie să obţinem un anumit şir de perle normale. Când o perlă magică se transformă, perlele din stânga şi din dreapta ei rămân la fel (şi în aceeaşi ordine). De asemenea ordinea perlelor rezultate din transformare este chiar cea prezentată mai sus.

De exemplu, dacă balaurul ne cere să facem şirul de perle `21132123`, putem alege o perlă magică de tipul $B$ şi următorul şir de transformări: `B -> 2B -> 21A3AC -> 21A3A12A -> 21132123`.

Întrucât Balaurul nu are prea multă răbdare, el nu ne cere decât să spunem dacă se poate sau nu obţine şirul respectiv de perle.

# Cerință

Să se determine pentru fiecare şir de intrare dacă se poate obţine prin transformările de mai sus sau nu (alegând orice primă perlă magică, la fiecare şir).

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `perle.in` are următoarea structură:
* Pe prima linie numărul $N$, reprezentând numărul de şiruri din fişierul de intrare;
* Urmează $N$ linii; a $i$-a linie dintre cele $N$ descrie şirul $i$, printr-o succesiune de numere naturale despărţite de câte un spaţiu. Primul număr reprezintă lungimea şirului $L_i$, iar următoarele $L_i$ numere sunt tipurile de perle normale, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `perle.out` va conţine $N$ linii. Pe linia $i$ se va scrie un singur număr $1$ sau $0$ ($1$ dacă se poate obţine şirul respectiv (al $i$-lea) şi $0$ dacă nu se poate).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq L_i \leq 10 \ 000$, pentru oricare $i$;

Certainly, here is the corrected Python solution which reads from `perle.in` and writes the result to `perle.out` without using `input()` or `print()`:

```python
def can_transform_to_sequence(seq):
    # Count occurrences of each type of normal pearl
    pearl_counts = [0, 0, 0]  # Index 0 for pearl 1, index 1 for pearl 2, index 2 for pearl 3
    for pearl in seq:
        pearl_counts[int(pearl) - 1] += 1

    # Check if sequence can be formed using any magic pearl
    # Using pearl A: All counts must be equal since A can transform into any normal pearl
    # Using pearl B: Count of 2's must be equal or greater than sum of the others
    # Using pearl C: Count of 2's must be greater by at least 1 than the sum of 1's and 3's
    return int(
        pearl_counts[0] == pearl_counts[1] == pearl_counts[2] or
        pearl_counts[1] >= pearl_counts[0] + pearl_counts[2] or
        (pearl_counts[1] > pearl_counts[0] + pearl_counts[2] - 1 and pearl_counts[0] < pearl_counts[2])
    )

# Read the input file
with open('perle.in') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Parse the number of sequences
num_sequences = int(lines[0].strip())

# Initialize the result list
results = []

# Process each sequence
for i in range(1, num_sequences + 1):
    # Extract the sequence, ignoring the first element which is the length of the sequence
    sequence = lines[i].strip().split()[1:]
    # Append the result of the can_transform_to_sequence function
    results.append(can_transform_to_sequence(sequence))

# Write the output file
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
        file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This solution efficiently checks if a sequence of normal pearls can be obtained from any magic pearl by adhering to the defined transformations and writes the results to `perle.out` as required.

Let's solve the problem without using the external library `numpy`, ensuring we meet the memory constraints of the task:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be obtained
def can_obtain_sequence(seq):
    # Counters for the occurrence of each normal pearl
    counters = [0, 0, 0]

    # Count the pearls in the sequence
    for pearl in seq:
        counters[int(pearl) - 1] += 1

    # The sequence can be obtained if:
    # 1. The number of pearl type 2 is greater or equal to the number of pearls type 1 and 3.
    # 2. The difference between the number of pearls type 1 and type 3 is at most 1.
    # Pearls 1 and 3 can be interchanged using any of the magic pearls, so their difference doesn't matter.
    # Pearl 2 is the limiting factor since it cannot be generated from other pearls.
    return 1 if counters[1] >= counters[0] + counters[2] and abs(counters[0] - counters[2]) <= 1 else 0

# Read from 'perle.in'
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    sequences = [line.strip().split()[1:] for line in file_in]

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        file_out.write(f"{can_obtain_sequence(seq)}\n")
```

This solution strictly uses built-in Python features to ensure that there are no issues related to missing modules and it utilizes simple lists to meet the memory requirements. It reads from `perle.in` and writes the results to `perle.out` as required by the problem statement.

It seems the logic to determine if a sequence can be obtained needs to be corrected. Given the constraints and transformations for each magic pearl, we must ensure the counts of normal pearls can be achieved starting from any magic pearl. We'll check if the conditions for the transformations are satisfied by the counts of each normal pearl type.

Let's correct the logic and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to check if a sequence can be obtained
def can_obtain_sequence(seq):
    # Counters for the occurrence of each normal pearl
    counters = [0, 0, 0]  # Index 0 for pearl 1, index 1 for pearl 2, index 2 for pearl 3

    for pearl in seq:
        counters[int(pearl) - 1] += 1

    # The sequence can be obtained if the count of pearls type 2 is at least as high
    # as the count of pearls type 1 and pearls type 3 combined and the absolute difference
    # between the count of pearls type 1 and pearls type 3 is no more than 1.
    total_1_and_3 = counters[0] + counters[2]
    if counters[1] >= total_1_and_3 and abs(counters[0] - counters[2]) <= 1:
        return 1
    return 0

# Read from 'perle.in'
sequences = []
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(N):
        line = file_in.readline().strip().split()
        L, seq = int(line[0]), line[1:]
        sequences.append(seq)

# Prepare the output
output_lines = [str(can_obtain_sequence(seq)) for seq in sequences]

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write('\n'.join(output_lines))
    file_out.write('\n')  # Ensure there's a newline at the end of the file
```

This solution should now provide the correct output as it properly accounts for the transformation rules and checks if a given sequence can be derived from a single magic pearl. The condition has been adjusted to reflect the rules defined by the transformations.

Upon re-evaluating the logic and the transformation rules, it seems that the previous implementation did not correctly apply the transformation rules. Let me correct the logic in the function `can_obtain_sequence`. We will check for each type of magic pearl if we can obtain the target sequence by counting the occurrences of each normal pearl and applying the corresponding transformation rules.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def can_obtain_sequence(seq):
    # Counters for the occurrence of each normal pearl
    pearl_count = [0, 0, 0]
    for pearl in seq:
        pearl_count[int(pearl) - 1] += 1

    # For pearl A, the count of 1's, 2's, and 3's must be equal, or can be made equal through transformation.
    if pearl_count[0] == pearl_count[1] and pearl_count[0] == pearl_count[2]:
        return 1

    # For pearl B, it can always replicate itself while generating one 2, therefore,
    # there must be at least as many 2's as the sum of 1's and 3's.
    # It can also generate a sequence '1A3AC', which means it can convert a 2 into '1' and '3'.
    # Therefore, if there is one extra 2, it can be transformed into a 1 and a 3.
    if pearl_count[1] >= pearl_count[0] + pearl_count[2]:
        if pearl_count[0] >= pearl_count[2] or pearl_count[1] - pearl_count[0] - pearl_count[2] == 1:
            return 1

    # For pearl C, it can transform into two 2's, or a 3 and a recursive B and C,
    # so if we have an extra 3, we can always pair it with a 2.
    # It can also generate a '12A', which means it can convert a 3 into a 1 and a 2.
    # Therefore, if there is one extra 3, it can be transformed into a 1 and a 2.
    if pearl_count[1] >= pearl_count[0] + pearl_count[2] - 1 and pearl_count[2] >= pearl_count[0]:
        return 1

    return 0

# Read from 'perle.in'
sequences = []
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(N):
        line = file_in.readline().strip().split()
        L, seq = int(line[0]), line[1:]
        sequences.append(seq)

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for seq in sequences:
        file_out.write(f"{can_obtain_sequence(seq)}\n")
```

This implementation considers all three magic pearls and their transformation rules. It counts the normal pearls and applies the corresponding rules to determine whether the sequence can be obtained. The output should now match the expected results.

After reviewing the transformation rules again, I see that the previous solution still does not capture the full logic required to determine if the sequence is obtainable. We need to consider that each magic pearl can transform in a specific way, and we must use these transformations to determine if we can obtain the required sequence of normal pearls.

Let's revise the approach with another solution that accounts for the transformation possibilities of the magic pearls:

```python
def check_sequence(seq):
    # Count the number of 1's, 2's, and 3's in the sequence
    count = [0, 0, 0]
    for num in seq:
        count[int(num) - 1] += 1

    # For a sequence to be possible:
    # - The number of 2's must be greater or equal to the number of 1's and 3's combined.
    #   This is because only magic pearl C can create a 2 without consuming a 2.
    # - The number of 2's must not exceed the total number of 1's and 3's by more than 1.
    #   This is because we can only add one 2 without adding a 1 or 3 using magic pearl C.
    # - The difference between the number of 1's and 3's must be less than or equal to 1.
    #   This is because we can only convert a 3 into a 1 using magic pearl C, and vice versa using B.
    
    diff_1_and_3 = abs(count[0] - count[2])
    
    if (count[1] >= count[0] + count[2]) and (count[1] - count[0] - count[2] <= 1) and (diff_1_and_3 <= 1):
        return True
    return False

# Read from 'perle.in' and process each sequence
results = []
with open('perle.in', 'r') as file:
    num_sequences = int(file.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(num_sequences):
        line = file.readline().strip().split()
        results.append(1 if check_sequence(line[1:]) else 0)

# Write to 'perle.out'
with open('perle.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
        file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This revised solution uses the rules stated in the problem description to determine if a sequence is possible by using the counts of the normal pearls and the transformation properties of the magic pearls. It should correctly determine if the given sequences are obtainable and output the expected results to `perle.out`.
