Pe Planeta ZUZU anul are $10 \ 000 \ 000$ zile, numerotate de la $1$ la $10 \ 000 \ 000$. La institutul de cercetări planetar, o grupă de specialişti au grijă de mai multe populaţii de viruşi. Pentru fiecare populaţie se alocă un interval de zile de lucru $[a, b]$, $a$ şi $b$ zile din anul zuzulian, în care se fac determinări asupra numărului de indivizi ai populaţiei, asupra formelor noi de viruşi apăruţi etc. Directorul institutului a constatat că există însă şi perioade în care nu se execută nici o cercetare, motiv pentru care l-a angajat pe Atomel, un statistician vestit, care trebuie să verifice perioada cea mai lungă de lucru în care cercetătorii sunt ocupaţi cu populaţiile de viruşi, precum şi cea mai lungă perioadă în care nu se face nici un studiu asupra viruşilor.

# Cerință

Fiind date numărul $n$ de intervale de lucru asupra populaţiilor de viruşi, precum şi pentru fiecare interval ziua de început şi cea de sfârşit a intervalului de lucru, să se determine care este cea mai lungă perioadă în care se lucrează asupra populaţiilor de viruşi, precum şi cea mai lungă perioadă în care nu se efectuează nici o observaţie asupra viruşilor.


# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `virus.in` conţine pe prima linie o valoare n cu semnificaţia numărul de intervale date; pe următorele $n$ linii câte două valori separate prin spaţiu ce descriu un interval $[a, b]$ de lucru şi observaţii asupra populaţiilor de viruşi. Intervalele sunt date corect, $a<b$.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `virus.out` conţine două valori separate printr-un spaţiu $L \ P$, unde $L$ reprezintă perioada cea mai lungă în care se fac cercetări asupra populaţiilor de viruşi, iar $P$ perioada cea mai lungă în care nu se fac observaţii. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < n \leq 5 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq a, b \leq 10 \ 000 \ 000$; unde $a$ și $b$ descriu un interval de timp.

# Write output to 'virus.out'
with open('virus.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{longest_work} {longest_nw}\n")
```

Please remember that this solution assumes the file `virus.in` exists in the same directory as the script and is in the correct format as specified in the challenge. It will output the result to `virus.out` in the same directory.

It seems that the `numpy` module is not available, and since we have strict memory constraints and are optimizing for efficiency, we can actually provide a solution without the need for `numpy`. I'll rewrite the solution without using any external libraries other than Python's standard library.

Here's the updated solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Define a function to merge overlapping intervals
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    sorted_by_lower_bound = sorted(intervals, key=lambda tup: tup[0])
    merged = []
    for higher in sorted_by_lower_bound:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < higher[0]:
            merged.append(higher)
        else:
            merged[-1] = (merged[-1][0], max(merged[-1][1], higher[1]))
    return merged

def find_longest_periods(intervals, n):
    # Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals
    merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
    
    # Find the longest working period
    longest_work = max(end - start for start, end in merged_intervals)
    
    # Find the longest non-working period
    longest_nw = 0
    for i in range(len(merged_intervals) - 1):
        longest_nw = max(longest_nw, merged_intervals[i+1][0] - merged_intervals[i][1])
    
    # Check for non-working periods before the first interval and after the last interval
    if merged_intervals[0][0] > 1:
        longest_nw = max(longest_nw, merged_intervals[0][0] - 1)
    if merged_intervals[-1][1] < 10000000:
        longest_nw = max(longest_nw, 10000000 - merged_intervals[-1][1])
    
    return longest_work, longest_nw

# Read input from 'virus.in'
with open('virus.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    intervals = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the longest working and non-working periods
longest_work, longest_nw = find_longest_periods(intervals, n)

# Write output to 'virus.out'
with open('virus.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{longest_work} {longest_nw}\n")
```

Remember to run this code in an environment where the `virus.in` file exists and has the correct format as per the challenge description. This updated version does not use `numpy` or any other external libraries and should not result in a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output arises from the way the longest non-working period is calculated. The final check for non-working periods after the last interval incorrectly assumes that if the last interval ends before the last possible day (10,000,000), then the non-working period lasts until the end of the year. However, we should only consider gaps between intervals as non-working periods, not the time after the last interval.

Let's fix the code by adjusting the computation of the longest non-working period. We need to remove the last check for the end of the year and only consider the gaps between intervals.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Define a function to merge overlapping intervals
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    sorted_by_lower_bound = sorted(intervals, key=lambda tup: tup[0])
    merged = []
    for higher in sorted_by_lower_bound:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < higher[0]:
            merged.append(higher)
        else:
            merged[-1] = (merged[-1][0], max(merged[-1][1], higher[1]))
    return merged

def find_longest_periods(intervals, n):
    # Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals
    merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
    
    # Find the longest working period
    longest_work = max(end - start for start, end in merged_intervals)
    
    # Find the longest non-working period
    longest_nw = 0
    for i in range(len(merged_intervals) - 1):
        # The non-working period is the gap between the end of the current interval and the start of the next
        longest_nw = max(longest_nw, merged_intervals[i+1][0] - merged_intervals[i][1] - 1)
    
    return longest_work, longest_nw

# Read input from 'virus.in'
with open('virus.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    intervals = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the longest working and non-working periods
longest_work, longest_nw = find_longest_periods(intervals, n)

# Write output to 'virus.out'
with open('virus.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{longest_work} {longest_nw}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly identify the longest non-working period between intervals and avoid considering the time after the last interval as a non-working period. Remember to run this code in an environment where the `virus.in` file is correctly formatted as per the challenge description.

The issue with the previous solution is that when calculating the longest non-working period, we are subtracting 1 more day than required. Since the intervals are exclusive of the end date, we do not need to subtract an additional day when calculating the gap.

Let's correct this by removing the `- 1` from the non-working period calculation.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Define a function to merge overlapping intervals
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    # Sort the intervals by their start date
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If list is empty or current interval doesn't overlap with previous, simply append it
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # If current interval overlaps, merge with the last interval in the list
            merged[-1] = (merged[-1][0], max(merged[-1][1], interval[1]))
    return merged

def find_longest_periods(intervals, n):
    # Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals
    merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
    
    # Find the longest working period
    longest_work = max(end - start for start, end in merged_intervals)
    
    # Find the longest non-working period
    longest_nw = 0
    # Look for gaps between merged intervals
    for i in range(1, len(merged_intervals)):
        gap = merged_intervals[i][0] - merged_intervals[i-1][1]
        longest_nw = max(longest_nw, gap)
    
    return longest_work, longest_nw

# Read input from 'virus.in'
with open('virus.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())
    intervals = [tuple(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the longest working and non-working periods
longest_work, longest_nw = find_longest_periods(intervals, n)

# Write output to 'virus.out'
with open('virus.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{longest_work} {longest_nw}\n")
```

This solution will now correctly identify the longest non-working period between merged intervals and output the correct longest work and non-work periods to the `virus.out` file.
