Autorităţile dintr-o zonă de munte intenţionează să stabilească un plan de urgenţă, pentru a reacţiona mai eficient la frecventele calamităţi naturale din zonă. În acest scop au identificat $N$ puncte de interes strategic şi le-au numerotat distinct de la $1$ la $N$. Punctele de interes strategic sunt conectate prin $M$ căi de acces având priorităţi în funcţie de importanţă. Între oricare două puncte de interes strategic există cel mult o cale de acces ce poate fi parcursă în ambele sensuri şi cel puţin un drum (format din una sau mai multe căi de acces) ce le conectează. 

În cazul unei calamităţi unele căi de acces pot fi temporar întrerupte şi astfel între anumite puncte de interes nu mai există legătură. Ca urmare pot rezulta mai multe grupuri de puncte în aşa fel încât între oricare două puncte din acelaşi grup să existe măcar un drum şi între oricare două puncte din grupuri diferite să nu existe drum. 

Autorităţile estimează gravitatea unei calamităţi ca fiind suma priorităţilor căilor de acces distruse de aceasta şi doresc să determine un scenariu de gravitate maximă, în care punctele de interes strategic să fie împărţite într-un număr de $K$ grupuri.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `urgenta.in` are următorul format:
$N\ M\ K$
$i_1 \; j_1 \; p_1 $ – între punctele $i_1$ şi $j_1$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_1$
$i_2 \; j_2 \; p_2 $ – între punctele $i_2$ şi $j_2$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_2$
...
$i_M \; j_M \; p_M $ – între punctele $i_M$ şi $j_M$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_M$

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `urgenta.out` va avea următorul format:
$\text{gravmax}$ – gravitatea maximă
$C$	– numărul de căi de acces întrerupte de calamitate
$k_1 \; h_1$ – între punctele $k_1$ şi $h_1$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
$k_2 \; h_2$ – între punctele $k_2$ şi $h_2$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
...
$k_C \; h_C$ – între punctele $k_C$ şi $h_C$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 \leq N \leq 255$
* $N - 1 \leq M \leq 32 \ 384$
* $1 \leq K \leq N$
* Priorităţile căilor de acces sunt întregi strict pozitivi mai mici decât $256$.
* Un grup de puncte poate conţine între $1$ şi $N$ puncte inclusiv.
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul va determina una singură.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Necessary imports
import numpy as np

# Read data from file
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort edges by priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize array to keep track of each node's parent for union-find
parent = np.arange(N + 1)
rank = np.zeros(N + 1, dtype=int)

# Union-find functions
def find(x):
    while x != parent[x]:
        parent[x] = parent[parent[x]]  # Path compression
        x = parent[x]
    return x

def union(x, y):
    rootX = find(x)
    rootY = find(y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootX] = rootY
        elif rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
        else:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
            rank[rootX] += 1

# Main logic
# Start with the highest priority edges and remove them until there are K groups
removed_edges = []
num_groups = N
for edge in edges:
    if num_groups == K:
        break
    i, j, _ = edge
    if find(i) != find(j):
        continue  # These nodes are already in different groups
    removed_edges.append(edge)
    union(i, j)
    num_groups -= 1

# Calculate the sum of priorities of the removed edges
gravmax = sum(edge[2] for edge in removed_edges)

# Write data to the output file
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{gravmax}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for edge in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{edge[0]} {edge[1]}\n")
```

This program reads from `urgenta.in` and writes to `urgenta.out`, using numpy for efficient array manipulation and union-find with path compression to manage the connected components. The edges are sorted by priority and removed one by one until the desired number of groups is achieved, then the results are written to the output file. The solution is designed to optimize both time and memory usage, and it should run well within the constraints given.

The exit code indicates that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the memory constraints are strict and the challenge specifies the need for optimization, we should avoid using third-party libraries like `numpy` and instead work with built-in Python data structures.

I will rewrite the entire solution without using `numpy`.

```python
# Function to find the root of the set which the element x belongs to
def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]

# Function to perform the union of two sets which elements x and y belong to
def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    rootX = find(parent, x)
    rootY = find(parent, y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootX] = rootY
        elif rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
        else:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
            rank[rootX] += 1

# Read data from file
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort edges by priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize arrays to keep track of each node's parent and rank for union-find
parent = [i for i in range(N + 1)]
rank = [0] * (N + 1)

# Main logic
# Start with the highest priority edges and remove them until there are K groups
removed_edges = []
num_groups = N
for edge in edges:
    if num_groups == K:
        break
    i, j, _ = edge
    if find(parent, i) != find(parent, j):
        continue  # These nodes are already in different groups
    removed_edges.append(edge)
    union(parent, rank, i, j)
    num_groups -= 1

# Calculate the sum of priorities of the removed edges
gravmax = sum(edge[2] for edge in removed_edges)

# Write data to the output file
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{gravmax}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for edge in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{edge[0]} {edge[1]}\n")
```

This solution only uses built-in Python features and should be efficient enough to handle the problem within the given constraints. The union-find algorithm implemented above uses path compression and union by rank to ensure that the time complexity for each `find` and `union` operation is almost constant, which is crucial for efficiency.

Upon reviewing the previous solution, I've identified the mistake. The solution was prematurely ending the iteration over the edges when the number of groups `num_groups` was equal to `K`. However, the correct approach should be to continue iterating and keep removing edges until the number of groups is just one less than `K`. At that point, the last edge to be removed will split the graph into exactly `K` groups.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the root of the set which the element x belongs to
def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]

# Function to perform the union of two sets which elements x and y belong to
def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    rootX = find(parent, x)
    rootY = find(parent, y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootX] = rootY
        elif rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
        else:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
            rank[rootX] += 1

# Read data from file
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort edges by priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize arrays to keep track of each node's parent and rank for union-find
parent = [i for i in range(N + 1)]
rank = [0] * (N + 1)

# Main logic
# Start with the highest priority edges and remove them until there are K-1 groups
removed_edges = []
num_groups = N
for edge in edges:
    i, j, _ = edge
    if find(parent, i) == find(parent, j):
        if num_groups == K:  # Stop when the next removal would result in K groups
            break
        removed_edges.append(edge)
        union(parent, rank, i, j)
        num_groups -= 1

# Calculate the sum of priorities of the removed edges
gravmax = sum(edge[2] for edge in removed_edges)

# Write data to the output file
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{gravmax}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for edge in removed_edges:
        i, j, _ = edge
        file.write(f"{i} {j}\n")
```

This corrected code continues removing edges until there are `K-1` groups left, at which point it stops. The next removal would create exactly `K` groups. We calculate the maximum severity (`gravmax`) as the sum of the priorities of the removed edges and output the results correctly to `urgenta.out`. The solution should match the expected output now.

Upon re-evaluating the approach, it seems that the logic for determining when to stop removing edges was correct, but an important step is missing. We need to actually count the number of unique groups after sorting and potentially removing edges, which was not implemented in the previous solution. 

We can re-implement the solution with this consideration in mind:

1. Sort the edges by decreasing priority to consider removing the most valuable edges first (as these would represent the most severe calamity).
2. Use the union-find algorithm with path compression to determine the number of unique groups after each edge removal.
3. Continue removing edges until the number of unique groups is equal to K.
4. Calculate the total severity and output the results.

Here is the rewritten solution:

```python
# Union-find's find function with path compression
def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]

# Union-find's union function
def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    xroot = find(parent, x)
    yroot = find(parent, y)
    if xroot == yroot:
        return False
    if rank[xroot] < rank[yroot]:
        parent[xroot] = yroot
    elif rank[xroot] > rank[yroot]:
        parent[yroot] = xroot
    else:
        parent[yroot] = xroot
        rank[xroot] += 1
    return True

# Read data from file
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort edges by priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize arrays to keep track of each node's parent and rank for union-find
parent = [i for i in range(N + 1)]
rank = [0] * (N + 1)

# Main logic
removed_edges = []
gravmax = 0
# Initially, there are N groups; we want to keep removing edges until we have K groups
for edge in edges:
    i, j, p = edge
    if find(parent, i) != find(parent, j):
        if not union(parent, rank, i, j):
            continue
        if N - len(removed_edges) - 1 == K:
            break
    else:
        gravmax += p
        removed_edges.append(edge)

# Write data to the output file
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{gravmax}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for i, j, _ in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{i} {j}\n")
```

The rewritten solution should now correctly calculate the total gravity of the calamity (`gravmax`) and list the removed edges that result in the highest severity while dividing the graph into exactly `K` groups. The output file will contain the correct data as expected.

It seems the previous solutions still did not achieve the expected results. The problem lies in the logic of choosing which edges to remove. The algorithm should start by considering all edges in the graph and then progressively remove the least priority edges until exactly K connected components remain.

To achieve this, we need to:

1. Initially consider no edges removed (all edges contributing to the total graph connectivity).
2. Remove edges of the lowest priority first, to maximize the sum of the removed edges' priorities.
3. Count the number of connected components after each removal. When K connected components are formed, we stop removing edges.
4. Record the severity and the edges to remove.

Let's rewrite the solution with this correct approach:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as fin:
    N, M, K = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in fin.readlines()]

# Sort edges by priority, smallest first for minimizing removal priority
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

# Union-Find data structure
parent = list(range(N + 1))
rank = [0] * (N + 1)

def find_set(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find_set(parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union_sets(x, y):
    x_root = find_set(x)
    y_root = find_set(y)
    if x_root != y_root:
        if rank[x_root] < rank[y_root]:
            parent[x_root] = y_root
        elif rank[y_root] < rank[x_root]:
            parent[y_root] = x_root
        else:
            parent[y_root] = x_root
            rank[x_root] += 1
        return True
    return False

# Initially, no edges are removed
removed_edges = []
num_components = N

# Remove minimum priority edges until we have K components
for i, j, p in edges:
    if find_set(i) != find_set(j):
        union_sets(i, j)
        num_components -= 1
    else:
        # This edge can be removed without disconnecting the graph
        if num_components <= K:
            # We have enough components, so we can stop removing edges
            break
        removed_edges.append((i, j, p))

# Calculate total priority of removed edges
total_priority = sum(p for _, _, p in removed_edges)

# Write the output file
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for i, j, _ in removed_edges:
        fout.write(f"{i} {j}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly determine the maximum severity by removing the edges with the lowest priorities first, while ensuring that exactly K connected components are maintained throughout the process. The output is written to `urgenta.out` as expected.
