Autorităţile dintr-o zonă de munte intenţionează să stabilească un plan de urgenţă, pentru a reacţiona mai eficient la frecventele calamităţi naturale din zonă. În acest scop au identificat $N$ puncte de interes strategic şi le-au numerotat distinct de la $1$ la $N$. Punctele de interes strategic sunt conectate prin $M$ căi de acces având priorităţi în funcţie de importanţă. Între oricare două puncte de interes strategic există cel mult o cale de acces ce poate fi parcursă în ambele sensuri şi cel puţin un drum (format din una sau mai multe căi de acces) ce le conectează. 

În cazul unei calamităţi unele căi de acces pot fi temporar întrerupte şi astfel între anumite puncte de interes nu mai există legătură. Ca urmare pot rezulta mai multe grupuri de puncte în aşa fel încât între oricare două puncte din acelaşi grup să existe măcar un drum şi între oricare două puncte din grupuri diferite să nu existe drum. 

Autorităţile estimează gravitatea unei calamităţi ca fiind suma priorităţilor căilor de acces distruse de aceasta şi doresc să determine un scenariu de gravitate maximă, în care punctele de interes strategic să fie împărţite într-un număr de $K$ grupuri.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `urgenta.in` are următorul format:
$N\ M\ K$
$i_1 \; j_1 \; p_1 $ – între punctele $i_1$ şi $j_1$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_1$
$i_2 \; j_2 \; p_2 $ – între punctele $i_2$ şi $j_2$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_2$
...
$i_M \; j_M \; p_M $ – între punctele $i_M$ şi $j_M$ există o cale de acces de prioritate $p_M$

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `urgenta.out` va avea următorul format:
$\text{gravmax}$ – gravitatea maximă
$C$	– numărul de căi de acces întrerupte de calamitate
$k_1 \; h_1$ – între punctele $k_1$ şi $h_1$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
$k_2 \; h_2$ – între punctele $k_2$ şi $h_2$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces
...
$k_C \; h_C$ – între punctele $k_C$ şi $h_C$ a fost întreruptă calea de acces

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 \leq N \leq 255$
* $N - 1 \leq M \leq 32 \ 384$
* $1 \leq K \leq N$
* Priorităţile căilor de acces sunt întregi strict pozitivi mai mici decât $256$.
* Un grup de puncte poate conţine între $1$ şi $N$ puncte inclusiv.
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, programul va determina una singură.

import numpy as np

# Read the input data from 'urgenta.in'

# Initialize the parent and rank arrays for the disjoint set
parent = np.arange(N+1)
rank = np.zeros(N+1, dtype=int)

# Helper functions for disjoint set
def find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(x, y):
    rootX = find(x)
    rootY = find(y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            rootX, rootY = rootY, rootX
        parent[rootY] = rootX
        if rank[rootX] == rank[rootY]:
            rank[rootX] += 1

# Variables to store the result

total_priority = 0
components = N  # Initial number of components

# Iterate over the edges in descending order of their priority
for i, j, p in edges:
    # If the endpoints are in different sets, join them,
    # otherwise it is an extra edge that can be removed to form a new group
    if find(i) != find(j):
        union(i, j)
    else:
        removed_edges.append((i, j))
        total_priority += p
        components -= 1
        if components == K:
            break

# If we couldn't find K-1 removable edges, we have to remove the lightest edges
# to get K components
if components > K:
    for i, j, p in reversed(edges):
        if find(i) != find(j):
            continue
        removed_edges.append((i, j))
        total_priority += p
        components -= 1
        if components == K:

# Write the output data to 'urgenta.out'
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for i, j in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{i} {j}\n")
``` 

Please note that this solution utilizes a variant of Kruskal's algorithm to create the maximum spanning forest. It sorts the edges by priority and then tries to remove the highest priority edges first to maximize the total priority of the removed edges. If the final number of components is greater than K, it continues removing edges with lower priorities until the desired number of components is reached. The use of numpy is for efficient array operations and should help in keeping the memory usage within the specified limits.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the program is being executed. Since numpy is not allowed, I will refactor the code to remove the dependency on numpy and use standard Python data structures instead.

Here is the refactored solution without numpy:

```python
# Read the input data from 'urgenta.in'
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the edges by their priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Kruskal's-like algorithm to find the maximum spanning forest with K-1 edges removed
# Initialize the parent and rank arrays for the disjoint set
parent = list(range(N+1))
rank = [0] * (N+1)

# Helper functions for disjoint set
def find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(x, y):
    rootX = find(x)
    rootY = find(y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            rootX, rootY = rootY, rootX
        parent[rootY] = rootX
        if rank[rootX] == rank[rootY]:
            rank[rootX] += 1

# Variables to store the result
removed_edges = []
total_priority = 0
components = N  # Initial number of components

# Iterate over the edges in descending order of their priority
for i, j, p in edges:
    # If the endpoints are in different sets, join them,
    # otherwise it is an extra edge that can be removed to form a new group
    if find(i) != find(j):
        union(i, j)
    else:
        removed_edges.append((i, j))
        total_priority += p
        components -= 1
        if components == K:
            break

# If we couldn't find K-1 removable edges, we have to remove the lightest edges
# to get K components
if components > K:
    for i, j, p in reversed(edges):
        if find(i) != find(j):
            continue
        removed_edges.append((i, j))
        total_priority += p
        components -= 1
        if components == K:

    file.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for i, j in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{i} {j}\n")
```

This solution should work in an environment where numpy is not installed. It uses native Python lists instead of numpy arrays to manage the disjoint set data structure. The performance might be slightly impacted due to the lack of numpy optimizations, but it will still be an efficient solution given the constraints of the problem.

The previous solution was incorrect because it tried to use a variant of Kruskal's algorithm, which is meant for finding the minimum spanning tree (or forest), while this problem requires breaking the graph into exactly K connected components with the maximum sum of edge weights. To achieve this, we should actually start by creating the maximum spanning tree (or forest) and then remove the K-1 highest priority edges to create exactly K components.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from 'urgenta.in'
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the edges by their priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Helper functions for disjoint set
def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    rootX = find(parent, x)
    rootY = find(parent, y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootX] = rootY
        elif rank[rootY] < rank[rootX]:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
        else:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
            rank[rootX] += 1

# Initialize the parent and rank arrays for the disjoint set
parent = list(range(N + 1))
rank = [0] * (N + 1)

# Create the maximum spanning tree (or forest) and remove K-1 highest priority edges
removed_edges = []
selected_edges = []
for i, j, p in edges:
    if find(parent, i) != find(parent, j):
        union(parent, rank, i, j)
        selected_edges.append((i, j, p))
    else:
        removed_edges.append((i, j, p))

# We want to remove K-1 edges with the highest priority to create K components
removed_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
removed_edges = removed_edges[:K-1]
total_priority = sum(p for _, _, p in removed_edges)

# Write the output data to 'urgenta.out'
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for i, j, _ in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{i} {j}\n")
```

This solution first sorts all the edges by their priority and then iteratively connects the nodes by selecting the highest priority edges until all nodes are connected (forming the maximum spanning tree or forest). Then, it removes the K-1 highest priority edges to generate exactly K connected components. The sum of the priorities of these removed edges gives us the required maximum gravity of the calamity. The result is then written to the output file `urgenta.out`.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly sorted all the edges that are not selected into the spanning forest, and then assumed that the first K-1 edges of this list are the ones to remove. However, this is not guaranteed to be correct, as we need to make sure that removing these edges actually splits the graph into the desired K components.

The correct approach is to build the maximum spanning tree and then remove edges in the order that they were added (from highest priority to lowest) until we have K components. This ensures that we have the maximum possible total priority.

Here is the correct solution:

```python
# Helper functions for disjoint set
def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    xroot = find(parent, x)
    yroot = find(parent, y)
    if rank[xroot] < rank[yroot]:
        parent[xroot] = yroot
    elif rank[xroot] > rank[yroot]:
        parent[yroot] = xroot
    else:
        parent[yroot] = xroot
        rank[xroot] += 1

# Read the input data from 'urgenta.in'
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the edges by their priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Kruskal's algorithm to build the maximum spanning tree
parent = list(range(N+1))
rank = [0] * (N+1)
mst_edges = []
for edge in edges:
    u, v, weight = edge
    if find(parent, u) != find(parent, v):
        union(parent, rank, u, v)
        mst_edges.append(edge)

# We now have the maximum spanning tree and need to remove the minimum number of highest priority edges
# to create exactly K connected components.
mst_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
removed_edges = mst_edges[:K-1]
total_priority = sum(weight for u, v, weight in removed_edges)

# Write the output data to 'urgenta.out'
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for u, v, _ in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

This solution ensures that the edges are removed in the correct order to achieve the maximum total priority while dividing the graph into K components. The list of edges in the maximum spanning tree (mst_edges) is sorted by priority in descending order, and then we remove the first K-1 edges to achieve the desired number of components. The sum of the weights of the removed edges gives the maximum gravity of the calamity.

The previous solutions failed to account for the fact that removing the highest priority edges first does not necessarily lead to a scenario of maximum gravity. The correct approach is to start by generating all possible connected components (initially, each node is its own component), then iteratively connect components by adding the highest priority edges until only K components remain. The last K-1 edges that would have been added to connect all components are the ones that we do not add, and their total priority gives us the scenario of maximum gravity.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
# Read the input data from 'urgenta.in'
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the edges by their priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Helper functions for disjoint set
def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    xroot = find(parent, x)
    yroot = find(parent, y)
    if rank[xroot] < rank[yroot]:
        parent[xroot] = yroot
    elif rank[xroot] > rank[yroot]:
        parent[yroot] = xroot
    else:
        parent[yroot] = xroot
        rank[xroot] += 1

# Initialize the parent and rank arrays for the disjoint set
parent = list(range(N+1))
rank = [0] * (N+1)

# Go through the edges and join the components until we have K components
removed_edges = []
total_priority = 0
num_components = N
for edge in edges:
    u, v, weight = edge
    if find(parent, u) != find(parent, v):
        if num_components == K:
            removed_edges.append(edge)
            total_priority += weight
        else:
            union(parent, rank, u, v)
            num_components -= 1

# Write the output data to 'urgenta.out'
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for u, v, _ in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

This solution will output the scenario with the maximum gravity by summing up the last K-1 highest priority edges that would have connected the components if we were to continue until we had a single component (which we don't do since we stop at K components). The edges are not added to the disjoint set when we reach K components, and these are the edges that would be "removed" in the scenario of maximum gravity.

The previous solutions have not correctly addressed the challenge. The task is to find edges whose removal will result in K groups with the maximum sum of priorities of the removed edges. This problem is a variant of the maximum spanning tree problem where we need to remove K-1 highest-priority edges to generate K connected components.

A correct solution involves building a maximum spanning tree (or forest) first. After that, we need to sort the edges used in the maximum spanning tree by priority (in descending order) and then pick the top K-1 edges to remove. This will create K connected components with the highest sum of weights for the removed edges.

Here is the updated and correct solution:

```python
# Read the input data from 'urgenta.in'
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the edges by their priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize disjoint set data structures
parent = [i for i in range(N + 1)]
rank = [0] * (N + 1)

# Disjoint set union-find functions
def find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(x, y):
    x_root = find(x)
    y_root = find(y)
    if x_root != y_root:
        if rank[x_root] > rank[y_root]:
            parent[y_root] = x_root
        elif rank[y_root] > rank[x_root]:
            parent[x_root] = y_root
        else:
            parent[y_root] = x_root
            rank[x_root] += 1

# Generate the maximum spanning tree (or forest)
mst_edges = []
for u, v, weight in edges:
    if find(u) != find(v):
        union(u, v)
        mst_edges.append((u, v, weight))

# Sort the edges of the maximum spanning tree by priority in descending order
# and select the top K-1 edges to remove
mst_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
removed_edges = mst_edges[:K - 1]
total_priority = sum(weight for _, _, weight in removed_edges)

# Write the output data to 'urgenta.out'
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for u, v, _ in removed_edges:
        file.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

This version of the solution should provide the correct output: it builds a maximum spanning tree and selects the K-1 highest-priority edges to remove in order to split the tree into K components with the maximum sum of weights. We then write these edges and the total sum of their priorities to the output file `urgenta.out`.

The problem with the previous solutions was that they did not correctly identify the edges that need to be removed to create K disconnected components while maximizing the total priority of the removed edges.

The correct approach is to:
1. Create a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) for the connected graph.
2. Once the MST is created, sort the edges in the MST by their weights in descending order.
3. Remove the top K-1 weighted edges from the MST to form K disconnected components.
4. The sum of the weights of the removed edges is the maximum gravity of the calamity.

Let's correct the solution by implementing this approach:

```python
# Read the input data from 'urgenta.in'
with open('urgenta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, M, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the edges by their priority in descending order
edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize disjoint set data structures
parent = [i for i in range(N + 1)]
rank = [0] * (N + 1)

# Disjoint set union-find functions
def find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(x, y):
    x_root = find(x)
    y_root = find(y)
    if x_root != y_root:
        if rank[x_root] < rank[y_root]:
            parent[x_root] = y_root
        elif rank[x_root] > rank[y_root]:
            parent[y_root] = x_root
        else:
            parent[y_root] = x_root
            rank[x_root] += 1

# Create the maximum spanning tree (MST)
mst_edges = []
for u, v, weight in edges:
    if find(u) != find(v):
        union(u, v)
        mst_edges.append((u, v, weight))

# Sort the edges used in the MST by their weights in descending order
mst_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Select the first K-1 edges from the sorted MST edges to be removed
removed_edges = mst_edges[:K - 1]
total_priority = sum(weight for _, _, weight in removed_edges)

# Write the output data to 'urgenta.out'
with open('urgenta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_priority}\n{len(removed_edges)}\n")
    for u, v, _ in sorted(removed_edges):
        file.write(f"{u} {v}\n")
```

This solution finds the maximum spanning tree, then removes the highest priority edges to achieve the desired number of components. It writes out those edges and the total priority, which should match the expected output. The sorted function is used at the end to ensure the edges are written in ascending order based on their nodes' labels, which matches the format of the expected output.
