Vasile lucrează intens la un editor de texte. Un text este format din unul sau mai multe paragrafe. Orice paragraf se termină cu `Enter` şi oricare două cuvinte consecutive din acelaşi paragraf sunt separate prin spaţii (unul sau mai multe). În funcţie de modul de setare a paginii, numărul maxim de caractere care încap în pagină pe o linie este unic determinat (notăm cu $MAX$).
\
Funcţia pe care Vasile trebuie să o implementeze acum este alinierea în pagină a fiecărui paragraf din text la stânga şi la dreapta. Pentru aceasta el va trebui să împartă fiecare paragraf în linii separate de lungime $MAX$ (fiecare linie terminată cu `Enter`). Împărţirea se realizează punând numărul maxim posibil de cuvinte pe fiecare linie, fără împărţirea cuvintelor în silabe. Pentru aliniere stânga-dreapta, el trebuie să repartizeze spaţii în mod **uniform** între cuvintele de pe fiecare linie, astfel încât ultimul caracter de pe linie să fie diferit de spaţiu, iar numărul total de caractere de pe linie să fie egal cu $MAX$. Excepţie face numai ultima linie din paragraf, care rămâne aliniată la stânga (cuvintele fiind separate printr-un singur spaţiu, chiar dacă linia nu este plină).

În general, este puţin probabil ca alinierea să fie realizabilă prin plasarea aceluiaşi număr de spaţii între oricare două cuvinte consecutive de pe linie. Vasile consideră că este mai elegant ca, dacă între unele cuvinte consecutive trebuie plasat un spaţiu în plus faţă de alte perechi de cuvinte consecutive, acestea să fie plasate la începutul liniei.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să citească lungimea unei linii şi textul dat şi care să alinieze textul la stânga şi la dreapta.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `text.in` conţine pe prima linie $MAX$, lungimea maximă a unui rând.
Pe următoarele linii este scris textul.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `text.out` conţine textul aliniat stânga-dreapta.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $2 \leq MAX \leq 1\ 000$
- **Atenție!** Lungimea maximă a oricărui cuvânt din text este de $40$ de caractere şi nu depăşeşte $MAX$. În enunțul original limita unui cuvânt era de $25$ de caractere, însă se pare că testele nu respectau această limită.
- **Atenție!** În cazul în care o linie este goală, aceasta se păstrează.
- Lungimea unui paragraf nu depăşeşte $1\ 000$ de caractere.
- Soluţia este unică.

This code reads from `text.in`, justifies the text according to the requirements, and writes the result to `text.out`. It assumes that the input file format is correct and that each paragraph is separated by two new line characters (`\n\n`). Please ensure you have the `text.in` file with the appropriate content when running this code.

The exit code 1 and the error message indicate that the program failed due to the `numpy` module not being found. However, in this context, `numpy` is not necessary for the solution, as standard Python functions can handle the required operations.

Let's remove the `numpy` import and rewrite the solution without using `numpy`.

```python
def justify_text(line_length, words):
    if len(words) == 1:
        return words[0] + ' ' * (line_length - len(words[0]))

    total_spaces = line_length - sum(map(len, words))
    gaps = len(words) - 1
    spaces_per_gap, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, gaps)

    line = words[0]
    for i in range(1, len(words)):
        if i <= extra_spaces:
            # Add an extra space to the first 'extra_spaces' gaps
            space = ' ' * (spaces_per_gap + 1)
        else:
            space = ' ' * spaces_per_gap
        line += space + words[i]

    return line

def process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length):
    words = paragraph.split()
    lines = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        if current_length + len(word) + len(current_line) > line_length:
            lines.append(justify_text(line_length, current_line))
            current_line = [word]
            current_length = len(word)
        else:
            current_line.append(word)
            current_length += len(word)

    lines.append(' '.join(current_line).ljust(line_length))

    return lines

def justify(file_in, file_out, line_length):
    with open(file_in, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        line_length = int(f.readline())
        paragraphs = f.read().split('\n\n')

    justified_text = []
    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        if paragraph.strip() == '':  # Preserve empty lines
            justified_text.append('')
            continue
        justified_text.extend(process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length))

    with open(file_out, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write('\n'.join(justified_text))

# Main execution
with open('text.in', 'r') as file_in:
    max_length = int(file_in.readline().strip())
justify('text.in', 'text.out', max_length)
```

This updated solution does not include the unnecessary `numpy` import and should work correctly given the constraints of the problem. The solution reads from `text.in`, processes the text to justify it, and writes the output to `text.out`. Ensure that `text.in` is in the same directory as this script when you run it.

The results differ because the current implementation does not correctly identify and handle separate paragraphs. The program must ensure that every paragraph is processed independently, and it does not currently do that. It seems to be considering the entire text as one paragraph.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how paragraphs are separated and processed. A paragraph should be defined by a blank line (or the end of the file), and each should be justified independently. The last line of each paragraph should be left-justified. Let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
def justify_text(line_length, words):
    if len(words) == 1:
        return words[0] + ' ' * (line_length - len(words[0]))

    total_spaces = line_length - sum(map(len, words))
    gaps = len(words) - 1
    spaces_per_gap, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, gaps)

    line = words[0]
    for i in range(1, len(words)):
        if i <= extra_spaces:
            # Add an extra space to the first 'extra_spaces' gaps
            space = ' ' * (spaces_per_gap + 1)
        else:
            space = ' ' * spaces_per_gap
        line += space + words[i]

    return line

def process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length):
    words = paragraph.split()
    lines = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        if current_length + len(word) + (len(current_line) > 0) > line_length:
            lines.append(justify_text(line_length, current_line))
            current_line = [word]
            current_length = len(word)
        else:
            if current_line:
                current_length += len(word) + 1
            else:
                current_length = len(word)
            current_line.append(word)

    # Last line of paragraph is left-justified
    lines.append(' '.join(current_line).ljust(line_length))

    return lines

def justify(file_in, file_out, line_length):
    with open(file_in, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        paragraphs = f.read().strip().split('\n\n')

    justified_text = []
    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        justified_text.extend(process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length))
        justified_text.append('')  # Add a blank line after each paragraph

    # Remove the last blank line added due to loop
    justified_text.pop()

    with open(file_out, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write('\n'.join(justified_text))

# Main execution
with open('text.in', 'r') as file_in:
    max_length = int(file_in.readline().strip())
justify('text.in', 'text.out', max_length)
```

This solution will read each paragraph, justify it, and then insert a blank line to separate it from the next paragraph. It also ensures that the last line of each paragraph is left-justified. The `justify_text` function has also been updated to handle scenarios where there is only one word in the line. Ensure that the `text.in` file is in the correct format and is placed in the same directory when running the code.

The issue with the current solution is that it is not correctly handling the reading of the maximum line length (`MAX`) from the input file. It reads `MAX` from the first line but mistakenly includes it again when processing the paragraphs, which causes the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that after reading the `MAX` value, we exclude it from the paragraph processing. Let's rewrite the solution to correct this issue:

```python
def justify_text(line_length, words):
    if len(words) == 1:
        return words[0] + ' ' * (line_length - len(words[0]))

    total_spaces = line_length - sum(len(word) for word in words)
    gap_count = len(words) - 1
    spaces_per_gap, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, gap_count)

    line = words[0]
    for i in range(gap_count):
        space = ' ' * (spaces_per_gap + (1 if i < extra_spaces else 0))
        line += space + words[i + 1]

    return line

def process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length):
    words = paragraph.split()
    lines = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        if current_length + len(word) + (len(current_line) > 0) > line_length:
            lines.append(justify_text(line_length, current_line))
            current_line = [word]
            current_length = len(word)
        else:
            current_line.append(word)
            current_length += len(word) + (1 if current_line else 0)

    lines.append(' '.join(current_line).ljust(line_length))

    return lines

def justify(file_in, file_out):
    with open(file_in, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        line_length = int(f.readline().strip())
        paragraphs = f.read().strip().split('\n\n')

    justified_text = []
    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        if paragraph:
            justified_text.extend(process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length))
            justified_text.append('')  # Add a blank line after each paragraph

    # Remove the last blank line added due to loop
    if justified_text:
        justified_text.pop()

    with open(file_out, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write('\n'.join(justified_text))

# Main execution
justify('text.in', 'text.out')
```

This updated solution reads `MAX` from the first line of `text.in` and uses it as the maximum line length for justifying the text. It then processes the paragraphs while ensuring they do not include the `MAX` value. The output is written to `text.out`. Make sure `text.in` is located in the same directory when running the code.

The issue with the output is that the program is not treating paragraphs independently. It should process each paragraph in isolation, but it's treating the input as a continuous stream of text without respecting paragraph boundaries. This causes the line "Ana are mere." and "Ion are multe pere" to be treated as a single paragraph, leading to incorrect justification.

Let's correct the solution to handle paragraphs separately, ensuring each paragraph is processed independently and the last line of each paragraph is left-justified:

```python
def justify_text(line_length, words):
    if len(words) == 1:
        return words[0] + ' ' * (line_length - len(words[0]))

    total_spaces = line_length - sum(len(word) for word in words)
    gap_count = len(words) - 1
    spaces_per_gap, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, gap_count)

    line = words[0]
    for i in range(gap_count):
        space = ' ' * (spaces_per_gap + (1 if i < extra_spaces else 0))
        line += space + words[i + 1]

    return line

def process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length):
    words = paragraph.split()
    lines = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        if current_length + len(word) + (len(current_line) > 0) > line_length:
            lines.append(justify_text(line_length, current_line))
            current_line = [word]
            current_length = len(word)
        else:
            current_line.append(word)
            current_length += len(word) + (1 if current_line else 0)

    if current_line:
        lines.append(' '.join(current_line).ljust(line_length))

    return lines

def justify(file_in, file_out):
    with open(file_in, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        line_length = int(f.readline().strip())
        text = f.read().strip()

    paragraphs = text.split('\n')
    justified_text = []

    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        if paragraph:
            justified_text.extend(process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length))
        else:
            justified_text.append('')  # Preserve empty lines

    with open(file_out, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write('\n'.join(justified_text))

# Main execution
justify('text.in', 'text.out')
```

This updated solution reads `MAX` from the first line of `text.in` and uses it as the maximum line length for justifying the text. It then processes each paragraph separately, respects blank lines, and ensures the last line of each paragraph is left-justified. The output is written to `text.out`. Make sure `text.in` is located in the same directory when running the code.

The main issue with the previous solution is that it is not correctly preserving paragraph breaks as given in the input. The input file separates paragraphs with a newline character, but the previous solutions were not handling these breaks appropriately. Instead of splitting the paragraphs using `\n\n`, we should be splitting them using `\n`, and we should not add extra blank lines after processing each paragraph unless they were present in the input.

Furthermore, the previous solution does not correctly handle the last line of each paragraph, which should be left-justified without any additional padding spaces at the end.

Let's address these issues and rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
def justify_text(line_length, words):
    if len(words) == 1:
        return words[0]

    total_spaces = line_length - sum(len(word) for word in words)
    gap_count = len(words) - 1
    spaces_per_gap, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, gap_count)

    line = words[0]
    for i in range(gap_count):
        space = ' ' * (spaces_per_gap + (1 if i < extra_spaces else 0))
        line += space + words[i + 1]

    return line

def process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length):
    words = paragraph.split()
    lines = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        if current_length + len(word) + (len(current_line) > 0) > line_length:
            lines.append(justify_text(line_length, current_line))
            current_line = [word]
            current_length = len(word)
        else:
            if current_line:
                current_length += len(word) + 1
            else:
                current_length = len(word)
            current_line.append(word)

    # Last line of paragraph is left-justified without additional padding
    lines.append(' '.join(current_line))

    return lines

def justify(file_in, file_out):
    with open(file_in, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        line_length = int(f.readline().strip())
        paragraphs = f.read().strip().split('\n')

    justified_text = []
    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        if paragraph.strip():
            justified_text.extend(process_paragraph(paragraph, line_length))
        justified_text.append('')  # Preserve paragraph breaks

    # Remove the last blank line added by the loop above
    if justified_text[-1] == '':
        justified_text.pop()

    with open(file_out, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        # Join paragraphs with a newline and trim trailing spaces on each line
        f.write('\n'.join(line.rstrip() for line in justified_text))

# Main execution
justify('text.in', 'text.out')
```

This revised solution should provide the expected output. When reading the input from `text.in` and processing the paragraphs, the solution keeps track of paragraph breaks as they are provided in the input. It then justifies the text within each paragraph, ensuring the last line is left-justified without additional padding. The output is written to `text.out` with paragraph breaks preserved. Make sure `text.in` is located in the same directory when running the code.

The problem with the previous solution is that it adds an empty line after every paragraph processed. This means that even if there's no empty line in the input to signify a new paragraph, the script adds one, resulting in an extra blank line. This is not the expected behavior according to the example given. 

We must adjust the script to only add a new line if there is an actual paragraph break (a blank line) in the input data. Let's fix this in the code:

```python
def justify_text(line_length, words):
    if len(words) == 1:
        return words[0]

    total_spaces = line_length - sum(len(word) for word in words)
    gap_count = len(words) - 1
    spaces_per_gap, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, gap_count)

This solution processes each paragraph independently and does not add an extra blank line unless it's part of the input data. The last line of each paragraph is left-justified as required, and the output is written to `text.out`. Ensure you have `text.in` in the same directory as the script with the provided input data when running this solution.
