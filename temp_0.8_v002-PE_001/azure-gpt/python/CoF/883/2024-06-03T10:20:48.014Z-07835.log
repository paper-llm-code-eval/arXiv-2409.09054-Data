Într-o tabără de vară se programează susținerea unor cursuri în $K$ săli de clasă. Sunt $N$ profesori care și-au exprimat dorința de a participa, fiecare dintre ei specificând intervalul de timp [$a_i, b_i$] în care își poate susține cursul. Programarea pe săli a profesorilor trebuie să țină cont de faptul că într-o clasă, la un moment dat, nu poate preda decât un singur profesor.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se faptul că organizatorii doresc susținerea a cât mai multor cursuri, să se determine:

1) Numărul maxim de cursuri care pot fi programate în cele $K$ săli de clasă, ținând cont de restricția indicată.
2) În dorința de a programa toate cursurile, în cele $K$ săli, organizatorii decid să modifice durata cursurilor, păstrând însă neschimbată ora de început a lor. Astfel, ei hotărăsc ca toate cursurile să dureze un interval egal de timp, care însă nu va depăși durata celui mai lung curs propus inițial de unul dintre cei $N$ profesori. Determinați care poate fi durata maximă pe care o pot avea cursurile în aceste condiții.

# Date de intrare

În fișierul de intrare `cursuri.in` se găsește pe prima linie un număr natural $C$. Pentru toate testele, $C$ poate lua numai valorile $1$ sau $2$. Pe linia a doua se găsește o pereche de numere naturale $N \ K$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând numărul profesorilor și numărul de săli de clasă. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsesc perechi de numere naturale $a_i \ b_i$, care reprezintă intervalele de timp în care cei $N$ profesori își susțin cursurile. Numerele în cadrul unei linii sunt separate printr-un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $1$, se va rezolva numai punctul $1$) din cerințe. În acest caz, fişierul de ieşire `cursuri.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând numărul maxim de cursuri care pot fi programate în cele K săli de clasă, ținând cont de restricția indicată.

Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $2$, se va rezolva numai punctul $2$) din cerințe. În acest caz, fişierul de ieşire `cursuri.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând durata maximă pe care o pot avea cele $N$ cursuri, astfel încât toate să poată fi susținute în cele $K$ săli disponibile.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq a_i < b_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* În cazul cerinței $2$ se garantează că pentru toate testele există soluție
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerinţe se acordă $45$ de puncte, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de a doua cerințe se acordă $45$ de puncte. Se acordă $10$ puncte din oficiu.

This python script reads from 'cursuri.in', processes the input, and writes the output to 'cursuri.out'. For case C == 1, it calculates the maximum number of courses that can be scheduled within the given constraints. For case C == 2, it determines the maximum duration that all courses can have so that they can be held in the available classrooms. The script employs numpy for efficient array operations and is designed to handle memory efficiently to avoid out-of-memory errors.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the script is being executed. Since the problem constraints require optimizing for memory and `numpy` might not be available, we need to avoid using it and rely on pure Python for the solution.

Here's the rewritten solution without using `numpy`:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        C = int(file.readline().strip())
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        intervals = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return C, N, K, intervals

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    end_times = [0] * K
    count = 0
    for interval in intervals:
        for i in range(K):
            if end_times[i] <= interval[0]:
                end_times[i] = interval[1]
                count += 1
                break
    return count

def get_max_duration(N, K, intervals):
    max_duration = max(b - a for a, b in intervals)
    durations = sorted(b - a for a, b in intervals)
    left, right = 0, max_duration
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        needed_rooms = sum((b - a) // mid for a, b in intervals)
        if needed_rooms > K:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid
    return left

def main():

        result = get_max_duration(N, K, intervals)
    write_output('cursuri.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

This solution uses standard Python lists and sorting techniques to solve the problem while being mindful of memory usage. The `solve_max_courses` function finds the maximum number of courses that can be scheduled and the `get_max_duration` function calculates the maximum duration of the courses.

Upon reviewing the program, I have identified a mistake in the `get_max_duration` function. The calculation for the `needed_rooms` is incorrect. Instead of dividing the duration of each course by `mid` to determine the number of rooms needed, we should actually be counting the number of courses that have a duration of at least `mid`. Additionally, the binary search condition used to adjust `left` and `right` may not be correct.

Let's correct the `get_max_duration` function to properly calculate the maximum duration using a binary search. The idea is to search for the maximum duration such that all courses can be scheduled, fitting within the available number of rooms. For each possible duration, we check if we can schedule all courses by ending them at the same time, immediately before the start of the next course that cannot be shortened to the current duration.

Here is the corrected and rewritten solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        C = int(file.readline().strip())
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        intervals = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return C, N, K, intervals

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    end_times = [0] * K
    count = 0
    for interval in intervals:
        for i in range(K):
            if end_times[i] <= interval[0]:
                end_times[i] = interval[1]
                count += 1
                break
    return count

def get_max_duration(N, K, intervals):
    intervals.sort()
    min_duration = 0
    max_duration = max(b - a for a, b in intervals)
    while min_duration < max_duration:
        mid_duration = (min_duration + max_duration) // 2
        count = sum(min(mid_duration, b - a) for a, b in intervals)
        required_rooms = (count + mid_duration - 1) // mid_duration
        if required_rooms > K:
            max_duration = mid_duration
        else:
            min_duration = mid_duration + 1
    return min_duration - 1

def main():
    C, N, K, intervals = read_input('cursuri.in')
    if C == 1:
        result = solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals)
    else:
        result = get_max_duration(N, K, intervals)
    write_output('cursuri.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With this correction, the `get_max_duration` function should now properly calculate the maximum duration for the courses, and the program should produce the expected result as provided in the test case.

---------- assistant ----------

The error message indicates a `ZeroDivisionError` at the line where `required_rooms` is calculated. This is caused by `mid_duration` being zero, which happens when `min_duration` and `max_duration` are the same at the beginning of the while loop, and `min_duration` is decremented to zero.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `min_duration` is set correctly and that `mid_duration` will never be zero when calculating `required_rooms`. Additionally, we need to adjust the binary search to find the maximum duration for which exactly `K` rooms are needed.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        C = int(file.readline().strip())
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())

    end_times = [0] * K
    count = 0
    for interval in intervals:
        for i in range(K):
            if end_times[i] <= interval[0]:
                end_times[i] = interval[1]
                count += 1
                break
    return count

def get_max_duration(N, K, intervals):
    # Instead of using duration directly, using the end times to calculate the number of needed rooms
    sorted_intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[1])
    max_duration = max(b - a for a, b in intervals)
    min_duration = 0
    while min_duration < max_duration:
        mid_duration = (min_duration + max_duration + 1) // 2
        rooms = 1
        current_end = sorted_intervals[0][1]
        for a, b in sorted_intervals:
            # If the current interval cannot start after the current_end, we need a new room
            if a < current_end:
                rooms += 1
                current_end = b
            else:
                current_end = max(current_end, a) + mid_duration
        if rooms <= K:
            min_duration = mid_duration
        else:
            max_duration = mid_duration - 1
    return min_duration

def main():
    C, N, K, intervals = read_input('cursuri.in')
    if C == 1:
        result = solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals)
    else:
        result = get_max_duration(N, K, intervals)
    write_output('cursuri.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated `get_max_duration` function should now handle the binary search correctly and avoid division by zero. It also changes the approach to ensure that we are scheduling courses end-to-end for a given duration rather than determining the number of times a duration can fit into each interval. This approach is more in line with the constraints and the intent of the problem.

Let's analyze the issue further. For the given input, we have four courses and two rooms. If we want to maximize the duration of all courses such that they can all be scheduled in the two rooms, we need to find the longest duration that still allows us to schedule all courses without any overlap in any room.

The logic in the `get_max_duration` function still seems to be incorrect. Let's rethink the approach to solve the second part of the problem. We need an algorithm that tests different potential durations and checks if they can fit into the schedule with the given rooms.

One way to do this is by starting with the duration of the longest course and reducing the duration until we find that all courses can fit in the available rooms. For each duration, we'll simulate the scheduling of courses to see if they fit.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        C = int(file.readline().strip())
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())

            if end_times[i] <= interval[0]:
                end_times[i] = interval[1]
                count += 1
                break
    return count

def can_schedule_all_courses(duration, intervals, K):
    end_times = [0] * K
    for start, end in intervals:
        for i in range(K):
            if end_times[i] <= start:
                end_times[i] = start + duration
                break

            return False
    return True

def get_max_duration(N, K, intervals):
    max_duration = max(b - a for a, b in intervals)
    min_duration = 1  # All courses must last at least 1 time unit
    while min_duration < max_duration:
        mid_duration = (min_duration + max_duration + 1) // 2
        if can_schedule_all_courses(mid_duration, intervals, K):
            min_duration = mid_duration
        else:
            max_duration = mid_duration - 1
    return min_duration

def main():

This solution should accurately find the maximum duration for the courses using a binary search and a helper function to check if all courses can be scheduled with a given duration.

The issue with the previous implementation is that the `can_schedule_all_courses` function does not consider the end time of intervals. It is scheduling courses based on the new duration starting at the course's original start time, but it does not verify if the course's original end time allows such a duration.

In order to determine the maximum duration, we should create a schedule where each course starts at its original start time and has a uniform duration that does not exceed its original end time. A room can be reused only if the next course's start time is not earlier than the current course's end time.

The approach is to perform a binary search to find the maximum duration. For each duration value, we simulate the scheduling and check if it is possible to fit all courses into the available rooms.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        C = int(file.readline().strip())
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        intervals = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return C, N, K, intervals

def write_output(filename, result):

def solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    end_times = [0] * K
    count = 0
    for start, end in intervals:
        for i in range(K):
            if end_times[i] <= start:
                end_times[i] = end
                count += 1
                break
    return count

def can_schedule_with_duration(duration, intervals, K):
    intervals.sort()
    end_times = [-1] * K  # Track the next available time for each room
    for start, end in intervals:
        # Check if the course can be scheduled in any room
        for i in range(K):
            if end_times[i] <= start and start + duration <= end:
                end_times[i] = start + duration
                break
        else:
            # If the course could not be scheduled in any room, return False
            return False
    return True

def get_max_duration(N, K, intervals):
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = max(b - a for a, b in intervals)
    while lower_bound < upper_bound:
        mid = (upper_bound + lower_bound + 1) // 2
        if can_schedule_with_duration(mid, intervals, K):
            lower_bound = mid
        else:
            upper_bound = mid - 1
    return lower_bound

def main():
    C, N, K, intervals = read_input('cursuri.in')
    if C == 1:
        result = solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals)
    else:
        # Sort intervals by start time, as it's required for duration checks
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        result = get_max_duration(N, K, intervals)
    write_output('cursuri.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected solution, we are taking into account not just the starting times of the courses but also their possible end times. The `can_schedule_with_duration` function checks if each course fits within its original time frame when given the `duration`. The binary search in `get_max_duration` looks for the longest `duration` that allows all courses to be scheduled within the given room constraints.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly determine the maximum course duration that can fit within the given times while maximizing the usage of the available rooms (K). The binary search algorithm needs to check if it's possible to schedule all courses with the current duration without overlapping in any of the K rooms.

Let's fix the `can_schedule_with_duration` function. Instead of just checking if the course fits within its original time frame, we must also ensure that a room is available. This can be done by keeping track of when each room becomes available again and finding a room that is available when the course is supposed to start.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        C = int(file.readline().strip())
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        intervals = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    return C, N, K, intervals

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))  # Sort by end time, then start time
    rooms = [0] * K  # Track the end time of the last course in each room
    count = 0
    for interval in intervals:
        for i in range(K):
            if rooms[i] <= interval[0]:  # Room is available if the current time is past the end time
                rooms[i] = interval[1]  # Schedule course in room i
                count += 1
                break
    return count

def get_max_duration(N, K, intervals):
    # Find the maximum possible duration of a course
    # Start with the minimum course duration (upper bound will be the duration of the longest course)
    max_course_duration = max(b - a for a, b in intervals)
    lower_bound, upper_bound = 1, max_course_duration

    # Perform binary search to find the maximum duration
    while lower_bound < upper_bound:
        mid = (lower_bound + upper_bound + 1) // 2
        # Check if all courses can be scheduled with the current duration
        # Sort intervals by start time
        intervals.sort()
        rooms = [0] * K  # Track when each room becomes available
        can_schedule = True
        for start, end in intervals:
            for i in range(K):
                if rooms[i] <= start and start + mid <= end:
                    # Schedule the course in room i
                    rooms[i] = start + mid
                    break
            else:
                # If no room could be found, we cannot schedule all courses with this duration
                can_schedule = False
                break
        if can_schedule:
            lower_bound = mid  # Duration works, try a larger one
        else:
            upper_bound = mid - 1  # Duration too large, try a smaller one
    return lower_bound

def main():
    C, N, K, intervals = read_input('cursuri.in')
    if C == 1:
        result = solve_max_courses(N, K, intervals)
    else:
        result = get_max_duration(N, K, intervals)
    write_output('cursuri.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected solution will correctly determine the maximum course duration that fits the constraints of the available rooms and the given course intervals. The `solve_max_courses` function will find the maximum number of courses that can be scheduled, while the `get_max_duration` function will find the maximum duration for which all courses can be scheduled. The binary search in the `get_max_duration` function searches for this maximum duration, and the `can_schedule` flag is used to determine if the current duration being tested is feasible.
