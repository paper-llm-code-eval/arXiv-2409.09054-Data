Ion şi-a construit o vilă pe frumosul vârf al unui munte. Acum proiectează o scară specială, pe care va urca de la şosea până la vilă. Diferenţa de nivel dintre şosea şi vilă este $H$ (deci aceasta trebuie să fie înălţimea totală a scării). Scara va avea $N$ trepte, toate de aceeaşi lăţime, dar de înălţimi distincte două câte două.

Ion a sesizat că efortul pe care îl depune pentru a urca o treaptă este egal cu înălţimea treptei. Dar dacă el urcă $x$ trepte deodată, efortul depus este egal cu media aritmetică a înălţimilor acestor $x$ trepte pe care le urcă deodată + un efort de valoare constantă $p$ (necesar pentru a-şi lua avânt). 

Fiind un tip atletic, Ion poate urca mai multe trepte deodată, dar suma înălţimilor treptelor urcate deodată nu trebuie să depăşească o valoare maximă $M$.

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine efortul minim necesar pentru a urca pe o scară construită conform restricţiilor problemei, precum şi o modalitate de a construi scara care va fi urcată cu efort minim.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `scara.in` va conţine pe prima linie $4$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu $H \ N \ M \ p$ (cu semnificaţia din enunţ).

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `scara.out` va conţine 
- pe prima linie va fi scris efortul minim necesar (cu $2$ zecimale cu rotunjire);
- pe cea de a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale nenule care reprezintă înălţimile celor $N$ trepte ale scării (în ordinea de la şosea către vilă), separate prin câte un spaţiu. 


# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < H \leq 75$
* $0 < N \leq 8$
* $0 < M < 14$
* $0 \leq p \leq 10$
* Pentru datele de test, problema are întodeauna soluţie. 
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii (modalităţi de a construi scara astfel încât să obţineţi efortul minim dorit), veţi afişa prima soluţie în ordine lexicografică.
* Spunem că vectorul $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_k)$ precedă în ordine lexicografică vectorul $y=(y_1, y_2, ..., y_k)$ dacă există $i \geq 1$ astfel încât $x_j=y_j$, pentru orice $j<i$ şi $x_i<y_i$.
* Dacă a doua zecimală a efortului minim este $0$, sau chiar ambele zecimale sunt $0$ nu este necesar să le afişaţi. Deci în exemplu s-ar fi putut scrie efortul minim $9$ sau $9.0$.
* Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru prima cerinţă (efortul minim).
* Dacă efortul minim este corect şi se afişează şi o soluţie corectă (care respectă restricţiile problemei şi corespunde efortului minim), dar această soluţie nu este prima din punct de vedere lexicografic, se obţine $80\%$ din punctaj. Pentru rezolvarea corectă şi completă a ambelor cerinţe se obţine $100\%$ din punctaj.

```

This script should be saved as `scara.py` and executed in the same directory which contains the `scara.in` file. The output will be written to `scara.out`. The script uses a combination generation to find all possible steps and dynamic programming to calculate the minimal effort needed to climb the stairs. It then writes the minimum effort and the corresponding steps in lexicographically first order to the output file.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment. However, since the problem requires optimizing for both time and memory usage and has a strict memory limit, it might be better to avoid importing large libraries such as `numpy` altogether.

Given that the constraints of the problem are relatively small (H ≤ 75, N ≤ 8, M < 14, p ≤ 10), we can use standard Python lists and simple arithmetic to achieve an efficient solution. Let's rewrite the solution without using `numpy`.

Here's a revised version of the solution, using only built-in Python functionality:

```python
# scara.py
import itertools

def gen_steps(H, N, M):
    # Generate all possible stair combinations
    for steps in itertools.combinations(range(1, H), N - 1):
        steps = [0] + list(steps) + [H]  # Include start (0) and end (H)
        if all(steps[i+1] - steps[i] <= M for i in range(N)):
            yield [steps[i+1] - steps[i] for i in range(N)]

def calculate_effort(steps, M, p):
    # Calculate the minimal effort to climb the generated steps
    N = len(steps)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (M+1) for _ in range(N+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(1, N+1):
        for prev_sum in range(M+1):
            for x in range(1, min(i, M // steps[i-1]) + 1): # Number of steps to jump
                if prev_sum + x * steps[i-1] <= M:
                    effort = dp[i-x][prev_sum] + p + x * steps[i-1]
                    dp[i][prev_sum + x * steps[i-1]] = min(dp[i][prev_sum + x * steps[i-1]], effort)
    
    return min(dp[N])

# Read data from input file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the least effort and corresponding steps
min_effort = float('inf')
best_steps = None
for steps in gen_steps(H, N, M):
    effort = calculate_effort(steps, M, p)
    if effort < min_effort:
        min_effort = effort
        best_steps = steps
    elif effort == min_effort and steps < best_steps:
        best_steps = steps

# Write the result to the output file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, best_steps)) + '\n')
```

This solution should work in the same way as the previous one but without using `numpy`. It should also be more memory efficient, which is crucial given the ~8MB memory limit.

The error message indicates that there is a comparison between a `list` and `NoneType`. The comparison `steps < best_steps` fails when `best_steps` is `None`, which will be the case initially when the first set of steps is being evaluated.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the comparison only happens when `best_steps` is not `None`. We can modify the conditional to first check if `best_steps` is not `None` before comparing the lists. Let's apply this fix to the program:

```python
# scara.py
import itertools

def gen_steps(H, N, M):
    # Generate all possible stair combinations
    for steps in itertools.combinations(range(1, H), N - 1):
        steps = [0] + list(steps) + [H]  # Include start (0) and end (H)
        if all(steps[i+1] - steps[i] <= M for i in range(N)):
            yield [steps[i+1] - steps[i] for i in range(N)]

def calculate_effort(steps, M, p):
    # Calculate the minimal effort to climb the generated steps
    N = len(steps)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (M+1) for _ in range(N+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(1, N+1):
        for prev_sum in range(M+1):
            for x in range(1, min(i, M // steps[i-1]) + 1): # Number of steps to jump
                if prev_sum + x * steps[i-1] <= M:
                    effort = dp[i-x][prev_sum] + p + x * steps[i-1]
                    dp[i][prev_sum + x * steps[i-1]] = min(dp[i][prev_sum + x * steps[i-1]], effort)
    
    return min(dp[N])

# Read data from input file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the least effort and corresponding steps
min_effort = float('inf')
best_steps = None
for steps in gen_steps(H, N, M):
    effort = calculate_effort(steps, M, p)
    if effort < min_effort or (effort == min_effort and (best_steps is None or steps < best_steps)):
        min_effort = effort
        best_steps = steps

# Write the result to the output file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, best_steps)) + '\n')
```

Now the program checks if `best_steps` is `None` before attempting to use it in a comparison, which should resolve the issue and prevent the `TypeError`. The output will be written to `scara.out` after the program finishes execution.

The incorrect output indicates that there's an issue with the way we are calculating the effort required to climb the steps. The dynamic programming implementation does not seem to correctly account for the additional `p` penalty for each jump, and the average calculation for the steps climbed in a single bound. 

Additionally, the problem statement suggests that the effort to climb `x` steps is the arithmetic mean of the heights of these `x` steps plus a constant effort `p`. However, our current implementation of `calculate_effort` simply adds up the step heights plus `p` for each jump, which is incorrect. We must adjust this to calculate the correct effort, including the arithmetic mean and the penalty `p`.

Let's rewrite the `calculate_effort` function to correctly reflect the problem's requirements and ensure that the output is the minimum effort required.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# scara.py
import itertools

def gen_steps_combinations(H, N):
    # Generate all possible combinations of N steps with total height H
    # Each step must be at least 1 unit tall
    if N == 1:
        yield (H,)
    else:
        for i in range(1, H - N + 2):
            for next_step in gen_steps_combinations(H - i, N - 1):
                yield (i,) + next_step

def calculate_min_effort(steps, N, M, p):
    # Calculate minimal effort to climb the stairs using dynamic programming
    # dp[i] stores the minimum effort needed to reach i-th step
    dp = [float('inf')] * (N + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # No effort needed to stay at the ground level
    
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            # Check if it's possible to jump from step j to step i
            if sum(steps[j:i]) <= M:
                jump_effort = p + sum(steps[j:i]) / (i - j)
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + jump_effort)
    
    return dp[N]

# Read data from input file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the least effort and corresponding steps
min_effort = float('inf')
best_steps = None
for steps in gen_steps_combinations(H, N):
    effort = calculate_min_effort(steps, N, M, p)
    if effort < min_effort or (effort == min_effort and (best_steps is None or steps < best_steps)):
        min_effort = effort
        best_steps = steps

# Write the result to the output file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, best_steps)) + '\n')
```

This solution generates all possible step combinations and calculates the effort correctly by considering the average height of the steps that are climbed together and the penalty `p`. The effort for each jump is now correctly computed as the average step height plus the constant effort for the jump. The dynamic programming approach ensures that we find the minimum effort needed. The output is then written to `scara.out`.

Upon reviewing the output, it appears that while the minimal effort calculated by the program is correct, the actual step heights produced do not match the expected output. The expected output requires a lexicographically first sequence of steps (1 4 2 3) that results in the minimum effort, whereas the program gave an output of (1 4 1 4), which meets the minimum effort requirement but is not the lexicographically first solution.

The problem lies in the ordering of generated step combinations. It seems that the `gen_steps_combinations` function does not generate the step combinations in lexicographical order, as required by the problem statement. To ensure that we output the lexicographically first solution, we must sort the generated steps before checking the effort.

Let's fix this issue by sorting the generated steps and using a correct lexicographical comparison:

```python
# scara.py
import itertools

# Generate all possible steps combinations in lexicographical order
def gen_steps_combinations(H, N):
    return itertools.permutations(range(1, H), N - 1)

# Returns a 2-tuple (effort, steps) where effort is the minimal effort needed
# to climb the given steps and steps is the actual steps in ascending order
def calculate_min_effort(H, N, M, p):
    min_effort = float('inf')
    best_steps = None

    for comb in gen_steps_combinations(H, N):
        steps = [0] + sorted(comb) + [H] # Add the base and the top
        steps = [steps[i+1] - steps[i] for i in range(len(steps) - 1)] # Get the differences

        # Check if the steps are climbable
        if all(step <= M for step in steps):
            # Calculate the effort to climb these steps
            effort = sum(steps) + (len(steps) - 1) * p
            if effort < min_effort:
                min_effort = effort
                best_steps = steps

    return min_effort, best_steps

# Read data from input file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Compute the least effort and the best steps
min_effort, best_steps = calculate_min_effort(H, N, M, p)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, best_steps)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now produce the lexicographically first sequence of steps that results in the minimum effort and match the expected output.
