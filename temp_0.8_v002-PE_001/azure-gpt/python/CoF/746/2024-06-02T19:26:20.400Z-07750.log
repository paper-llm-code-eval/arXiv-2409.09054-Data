Ion şi-a construit o vilă pe frumosul vârf al unui munte. Acum proiectează o scară specială, pe care va urca de la şosea până la vilă. Diferenţa de nivel dintre şosea şi vilă este $H$ (deci aceasta trebuie să fie înălţimea totală a scării). Scara va avea $N$ trepte, toate de aceeaşi lăţime, dar de înălţimi distincte două câte două.

Ion a sesizat că efortul pe care îl depune pentru a urca o treaptă este egal cu înălţimea treptei. Dar dacă el urcă $x$ trepte deodată, efortul depus este egal cu media aritmetică a înălţimilor acestor $x$ trepte pe care le urcă deodată + un efort de valoare constantă $p$ (necesar pentru a-şi lua avânt). 

Fiind un tip atletic, Ion poate urca mai multe trepte deodată, dar suma înălţimilor treptelor urcate deodată nu trebuie să depăşească o valoare maximă $M$.

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine efortul minim necesar pentru a urca pe o scară construită conform restricţiilor problemei, precum şi o modalitate de a construi scara care va fi urcată cu efort minim.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `scara.in` va conţine pe prima linie $4$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu $H \ N \ M \ p$ (cu semnificaţia din enunţ).

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `scara.out` va conţine 
- pe prima linie va fi scris efortul minim necesar (cu $2$ zecimale cu rotunjire);
- pe cea de a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale nenule care reprezintă înălţimile celor $N$ trepte ale scării (în ordinea de la şosea către vilă), separate prin câte un spaţiu. 


# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < H \leq 75$
* $0 < N \leq 8$
* $0 < M < 14$
* $0 \leq p \leq 10$
* Pentru datele de test, problema are întodeauna soluţie. 
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii (modalităţi de a construi scara astfel încât să obţineţi efortul minim dorit), veţi afişa prima soluţie în ordine lexicografică.
* Spunem că vectorul $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_k)$ precedă în ordine lexicografică vectorul $y=(y_1, y_2, ..., y_k)$ dacă există $i \geq 1$ astfel încât $x_j=y_j$, pentru orice $j<i$ şi $x_i<y_i$.
* Dacă a doua zecimală a efortului minim este $0$, sau chiar ambele zecimale sunt $0$ nu este necesar să le afişaţi. Deci în exemplu s-ar fi putut scrie efortul minim $9$ sau $9.0$.
* Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru prima cerinţă (efortul minim).
* Dacă efortul minim este corect şi se afişează şi o soluţie corectă (care respectă restricţiile problemei şi corespunde efortului minim), dar această soluţie nu este prima din punct de vedere lexicografic, se obţine $80\%$ din punctaj. Pentru rezolvarea corectă şi completă a ambelor cerinţe se obţine $100\%$ din punctaj.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# scara.py

import numpy as np
from itertools import permutations

# Read input from file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Compute all possible heights for the steps
def generate_steps(H, N):
    solutions = []
    for steps in permutations(range(1, H), N):  # all permutations of N numbers that add up to H
        if sum(steps) == H:
            solutions.append(steps)
    return solutions

# Check if the sequence of steps is valid
def valid_sequence(steps, M):
    return all(sum(steps[i:j]) <= M for i in range(len(steps)) for j in range(i+1, len(steps)+1))

# Calculate the effort for a given sequence of steps
def calculate_effort(steps, p):
    return sum((np.mean(steps[i:j]) + p) for i in range(len(steps)) for j in range(i+1, len(steps)+1) if sum(steps[i:j]) <= M)

# Find the optimal sequence of steps and the minimum effort
min_effort = float('inf')
optimal_steps = None

for steps in generate_steps(H, N):
    if valid_sequence(steps, M):
        effort = calculate_effort(steps, p)
        if effort < min_effort:
            min_effort = effort
            optimal_steps = steps
        elif effort == min_effort and steps < optimal_steps:
            optimal_steps = steps

# Write output to file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{min_effort:.2f}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, optimal_steps)) + "\n")
```

This solution generates all possible permutations of step heights that add up to H, checks if they're valid under the maximum step height constraint M, calculates the effort for each valid sequence, and selects the one with the minimum effort. If there are multiple sequences with the same effort, the one that comes first lexicographically is chosen. The result is then written to `scara.out`. 

Please note that the solution provided might work theoretically but may not meet the efficiency requirements or memory constraints for larger inputs due to the use of permutations. Moreover, due to the restrictions of this environment, file I/O functionalities have been written according to the specifications but cannot be tested here directly. If you encounter any issues or need further optimization, additional steps may be necessary to reduce the memory footprint or improve the performance of the algorithm.

Given that this environment does not support the `numpy` library, and we need to optimize for both time and memory usage, we'll need to implement the solution without using `numpy` or other third-party libraries. Moreover, we should avoid generating all permutations due to memory constraints and instead use a dynamic programming approach that generates only valid steps configurations.

Here's a rewritten solution optimizing for memory and without using external libraries:

```python
# scara.py
import itertools

# Function to generate all valid steps that sum up to H and respects M
def generate_valid_steps(H, N, M, height_so_far=0, step_so_far=(), steps=[]):
    if len(step_so_far) == N:
        if height_so_far == H:
            steps.append(step_so_far)
        return steps
    for i in range(1, min(H - height_so_far, M) + 1):
        generate_valid_steps(H, N, M, height_so_far + i, step_so_far + (i,), steps)
    return steps

# Function to calculate the effort to climb the steps
def calculate_effort(steps, p, M):
    effort = 0
    for i in range(len(steps)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(steps) + 1):
            if sum(steps[i:j]) <= M:
                effort += (sum(steps[i:j]) / (j - i)) + p
    return round(effort, 2)

# Main function to find the minimum effort and corresponding steps
def find_minimum_effort(H, N, M, p):
    valid_steps = generate_valid_steps(H, N, M)
    min_effort = float('inf')
    min_steps = []
    for steps in valid_steps:
        effort = calculate_effort(steps, p, M)
        if effort < min_effort:
            min_effort = effort
            min_steps = steps
        elif effort == min_effort and steps < min_steps:
            min_steps = steps
    return min_effort, min_steps

# Read input from file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find minimum effort and steps
min_effort, min_steps = find_minimum_effort(H, N, M, p)

# Write output to file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{min_effort:.2f}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, min_steps)) + "\n")
```

This solution uses a recursive function to generate only the valid step configurations that sum up to H and respect the maximum step height M. It explores different step heights one by one and backtracks when necessary. This approach ensures to use minimal memory as it does not store all permutations at once.

However, please keep in mind that the performance of this code strongly depends on the input values. Since the maximum values for H and N are relatively small (75 and 8 respectively), this recursive approach should work within the given constraints. But for much larger values, further optimization might be necessary.

The result differs from the expected output because the `generate_valid_steps` function is not filtering the steps correctly based on the unique heights constraint. The initial implementation is generating all steps combinations that sum up to H without ensuring that each step height is unique. Additionally, the `calculate_effort` function is incorrectly rounded before the final sum, which can lead to precision issues.

To fix the solution, we need to:

- Ensure that `generate_valid_steps` generates steps with unique heights.
- Modify `calculate_effort` to calculate the total effort correctly according to the problem statement, considering jumping multiple steps should only add a single constant effort `p`.

Let's rewrite the solution to fix these issues. We'll also adjust the approach to ensure that we're using memory efficiently:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Function to generate and check valid step combinations
def generate_steps(H, N):
    # Generate all step heights
    steps = list(range(1, H))
    for combo in combinations(steps, N):
        if sum(combo) == H:
            yield combo

# Calculate the effort to climb the steps
def calculate_effort(steps, M, p):
    effort = 0
    for i in range(len(steps)):
        step_sum = steps[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, len(steps)):
            step_sum += steps[j]
            if step_sum > M:
                break
            effort += step_sum / (j - i + 1) + p
    return effort

# Main function to find the minimum effort and corresponding steps
def find_minimum_effort(H, N, M, p):
    min_effort = None
    min_steps = None
    for steps in generate_steps(H, N):
        effort = calculate_effort(steps, M, p)
        if min_effort is None or effort < min_effort:
            min_effort = effort
            min_steps = steps
        elif effort == min_effort and steps < min_steps:
            min_steps = steps
    return min_effort, min_steps

# Read input from file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate minimum effort and steps
min_effort, min_steps = find_minimum_effort(H, N, M, p)

# Write output to file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{min_effort:.2f}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, min_steps)) + "\n")
```

This solution uses combinations instead of permutations to ensure that each step height is unique, and it calculates the effort correctly by considering the constant additional effort `p` only once for each jump. It also compares combinations lexicographically to ensure the first solution in order lexicographically is chosen when multiple solutions have the same effort.

The issue with the previous solution is that it incorrectly calculates the effort required to climb the stairs. Specifically, the calculation of the effort for jumping multiple steps at once doesn't correctly apply the constant additional effort of `p` only once per jump. Instead, it applies `p` for each pair of steps within a jump, which is not following the problem statement.

The correct approach is to calculate the effort as the sum of the average height of the steps for each jump plus the constant `p` for each jump started, not for each pair of steps.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct algorithm to calculate the effort:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Function to generate all possible unique height combinations
def generate_unique_combinations(H, N):
    for steps in combinations(range(1, H), N):  # Generate unique height combinations
        if sum(steps) == H:
            yield steps

# Calculate the minimum effort required to climb the selected steps
def calculate_effort(steps, M, p):
    effort = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(steps):
        jump_effort = steps[i]
        jump_height = steps[i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < len(steps) and jump_height + steps[j] <= M:
            jump_height += steps[j]
            jump_effort += steps[j]
            j += 1
        effort += jump_effort / (j - i) + p
        i = j
    return effort

# Main function to find the minimum effort and corresponding unique steps
def find_minimum_effort(H, N, M, p):
    min_effort = float('inf')
    min_steps = None
    for steps in generate_unique_combinations(H, N):
        effort = calculate_effort(steps, M, p)
        if effort < min_effort:
            min_effort = effort
            min_steps = steps
        elif effort == min_effort and steps < min_steps:
            min_steps = steps
    return min_effort, min_steps

# Read input from file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the minimum effort and steps required to climb the stairs
min_effort, min_steps = find_minimum_effort(H, N, M, p)

# Write the output to the file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{min_effort:.2f}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, min_steps)) + "\n")
```

This solution should correctly calculate the effort according to the problem statement and also generate the unique steps that sum up to `H`. It respects the lexicographical order for multiple solutions with the same minimum effort. The `calculate_effort` function has been adjusted to apply the constant effort `p` only once for each jump.

Upon further review of the calculation logic and the constraints provided in the problem, I see that my previous solution did not correctly handle the condition that Ion can only jump up steps with a combined height not exceeding M. Additionally, my previous solution did not generate step combinations in ascending order, which is a requirement for finding the first solution in lexicographic order.

Let's address these issues correctly in a new implementation:

1. We will generate all combinations of N steps that add up to H and sort each combination to ensure ascending order, which will maintain the lexicographic requirement.
2. We will then iterate over each combination and calculate the effort needed to climb the steps according to the rules: the effort of climbing multiple steps is the average of their heights plus the constant p, only if the sum of their heights doesn't exceed M.
3. We will keep track of the minimum effort and the corresponding steps.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from itertools import product

# Read input from file
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Function to generate all possible unique combinations of step heights
def generate_step_heights(H, N):
    for steps in product(range(1, M + 1), repeat=N):
        if sum(steps) == H:
            yield tuple(sorted(steps))

# Calculate the climbing effort for the given steps
def climbing_effort(steps, M, p):
    effort = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(steps):
        j = i
        jump_height = 0
        # Calculate the total height for the current jump
        while j < len(steps) and jump_height + steps[j] <= M:
            jump_height += steps[j]
            j += 1
        # Calculate the effort for the current jump
        effort += (jump_height / (j - i)) + p
        i = j
    return round(effort, 2)

# Find the combination of steps with the minimum climbing effort
min_effort = float('inf')
min_effort_steps = None
for steps in generate_step_heights(H, N):
    effort = climbing_effort(steps, M, p)
    if effort < min_effort:
        min_effort = effort
        min_effort_steps = steps

# Write the output to the file
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{min_effort:.2f}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, min_effort_steps)) + "\n")
```

This solution should output the correct minimum effort and the steps in ascending order that Ion can take to climb with the least amount of effort under the given constraints.

The discrepancies between the expected and found result arise because the current algorithm does not correctly enforce the unique height constraint for each step. Also, the current algorithm generates all possible combinations of step heights that add up to H, but it does not ensure that each step has a unique height, which is a requirement of the problem. 

Let's fix these issues with the following approach:

1. We will use a recursive function to generate all valid combinations of steps that sum up to H, ensuring that each step has a unique height and follows the order from smallest to largest to maintain the lexicographic order.
2. Once we have a valid combination, we will calculate the climbing effort by considering jumps of steps with combined heights not exceeding M and applying the additional constant effort p only once for each jump.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# scara.py

# Function to recursively generate all valid combinations of steps
def generate_steps(H, N, current_sum=0, start=1, steps=[]):
    if len(steps) == N:
        if current_sum == H:
            yield tuple(steps)
    else:
        for i in range(start, H):
            if current_sum + i <= H:
                # Recurse with next step
                yield from generate_steps(H, N, current_sum + i, i + 1, steps + [i])

# Function to calculate the effort to go up the stairs
def calculate_effort(steps, N, M, p):
    effort = 0
    i = 0
    while i < N:
        jump_height = steps[i]
        jump_count = 1
        while i + jump_count < N and jump_height + steps[i + jump_count] <= M:
            jump_height += steps[i + jump_count]
            jump_count += 1
        effort += (jump_height / jump_count) + p
        i += jump_count
    return effort

# Read the inputs
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the steps and the minimum effort
min_effort = float('inf')
min_steps = []

for steps in generate_steps(H, N):
    effort = calculate_effort(steps, N, M, p)
    if effort < min_effort:
        min_effort = effort
        min_steps = steps

# Write the output
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{min_effort:.2f}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, min_steps)) + "\n")
```

This solution should give the correct minimum effort and steps while ensuring that steps are of unique height and in ascending order, which aligns with the lexicographic order requirement. The `generate_steps` function ensures that all combinations add up to H, and each step is taller than the previous one. The `calculate_effort` function computes the effort correctly, considering the constraints given in the problem statement.
