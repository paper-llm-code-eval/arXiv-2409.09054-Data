Ion şi-a construit o vilă pe frumosul vârf al unui munte. Acum proiectează o scară specială, pe care va urca de la şosea până la vilă. Diferenţa de nivel dintre şosea şi vilă este $H$ (deci aceasta trebuie să fie înălţimea totală a scării). Scara va avea $N$ trepte, toate de aceeaşi lăţime, dar de înălţimi distincte două câte două.

Ion a sesizat că efortul pe care îl depune pentru a urca o treaptă este egal cu înălţimea treptei. Dar dacă el urcă $x$ trepte deodată, efortul depus este egal cu media aritmetică a înălţimilor acestor $x$ trepte pe care le urcă deodată + un efort de valoare constantă $p$ (necesar pentru a-şi lua avânt). 

Fiind un tip atletic, Ion poate urca mai multe trepte deodată, dar suma înălţimilor treptelor urcate deodată nu trebuie să depăşească o valoare maximă $M$.

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine efortul minim necesar pentru a urca pe o scară construită conform restricţiilor problemei, precum şi o modalitate de a construi scara care va fi urcată cu efort minim.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `scara.in` va conţine pe prima linie $4$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu $H \ N \ M \ p$ (cu semnificaţia din enunţ).

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `scara.out` va conţine 
- pe prima linie va fi scris efortul minim necesar (cu $2$ zecimale cu rotunjire);
- pe cea de a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale nenule care reprezintă înălţimile celor $N$ trepte ale scării (în ordinea de la şosea către vilă), separate prin câte un spaţiu. 


# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < H \leq 75$
* $0 < N \leq 8$
* $0 < M < 14$
* $0 \leq p \leq 10$
* Pentru datele de test, problema are întodeauna soluţie. 
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii (modalităţi de a construi scara astfel încât să obţineţi efortul minim dorit), veţi afişa prima soluţie în ordine lexicografică.
* Spunem că vectorul $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_k)$ precedă în ordine lexicografică vectorul $y=(y_1, y_2, ..., y_k)$ dacă există $i \geq 1$ astfel încât $x_j=y_j$, pentru orice $j<i$ şi $x_i<y_i$.
* Dacă a doua zecimală a efortului minim este $0$, sau chiar ambele zecimale sunt $0$ nu este necesar să le afişaţi. Deci în exemplu s-ar fi putut scrie efortul minim $9$ sau $9.0$.
* Se acordă $40\%$ din punctaj pentru prima cerinţă (efortul minim).
* Dacă efortul minim este corect şi se afişează şi o soluţie corectă (care respectă restricţiile problemei şi corespunde efortului minim), dar această soluţie nu este prima din punct de vedere lexicografic, se obţine $80\%$ din punctaj. Pentru rezolvarea corectă şi completă a ambelor cerinţe se obţine $100\%$ din punctaj.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import permutations

# Read data from scara.in
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
min_effort = float('inf')
min_heights = None

# Helper function to calculate the effort
def calculate_effort(heights, M, p):
    effort, current_sum = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        current_sum += heights[i]
        if current_sum > M:
            effort += p + current_sum - heights[i]
            current_sum = heights[i]
    effort += p + current_sum
    return effort

# Helper function to check if the heights are valid
def is_valid_heights(heights, H, M):
    return sum(heights) == H and all(0 < height <= M for height in heights)

# Generate all possible permutations of step heights
for heights in permutations(range(1, H + 1), N):
    if is_valid_heights(heights, H, M):
        effort = calculate_effort(heights, M, p)
        if effort < min_effort:
            min_effort = effort
            min_heights = heights

# Write data to scara.out
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, min_heights)) + '\n')
```
```

The above code calculates all possible permutations of step heights that sum up to H and checks if the sum of the heights in sequence does not exceed M. It then calculates the effort for each valid combination and keeps track of the minimum effort. It finally writes this minimum effort and the corresponding step heights to `scara.out`.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since we cannot use external libraries like `numpy`, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` and utilizing only standard Python libraries.

Here's the updated python code that respects the memory limit and doesn't use external libraries:

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations

def calculate_effort(steps, p):
    effort = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(steps):
        effort += (sum(steps[i:i+steps_to_jump]) / steps_to_jump) + p
        i += steps_to_jump
    return effort

# Read data from scara.in
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize minimum effort and steps configuration
min_effort = float('inf')
steps_config = None

# Generate all possible combinations of step heights that sum up to H
# It's a combination with replacement problem because the sum of the heights should be equal to H
for combination in set(permutations([i for i in range(1, M+1)] * N, N)):
    if sum(combination) == H:
        # Check if any permutation of this combination has not been considered and is lexicographically smaller
        permutations_checked = set()
        for perm in permutations(combination):
            if perm in permutations_checked:
                continue
            permutations_checked.add(perm)
            # Check if this permutation is lexicographically smaller than the current best solution
            if steps_config is None or perm < steps_config:
                # Calculate the effort for this permutation
                current_effort = calculate_effort(perm, p)
                # If the current effort is better than the minimum effort, update the minimum effort and steps configuration
                if current_effort < min_effort:
                    min_effort = current_effort
                    steps_config = perm

# Write data to scara.out
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, steps_config)) + '\n')
```

This updated code uses built-in Python functions and logic to generate the appropriate permutations and combinations of step heights, calculate the effort, and find the minimum effort and associated step configuration. It then writes the output to `scara.out`.

It seems I referred to a variable `steps_to_jump` that is not defined within the scope of the `calculate_effort` function. I'll correct the solution by removing the need for this undefined variable. 

We'll need to change the logic to properly calculate the effort according to the rules described, taking care of the maximum height `M` that Ion can climb at once and the constant effort `p` for each jump.

Here is the revised code:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Function to calculate the total effort to climb the steps
def calculate_effort(heights, M, p):
    effort = 0
    current_sum = 0
    for height in heights:
        if current_sum + height > M:
            effort += p + current_sum  # Add effort for the previous steps
            current_sum = 0  # Reset current sum
        current_sum += height
    effort += p + current_sum  # Add effort for the last set of steps
    return effort

# Function to generate all valid permutations of steps that sum to H
def generate_step_permutations(N, H, M):
    for heights in permutations(range(1, M + 1), N):
        if sum(heights) == H:
            yield heights

# Read data from scara.in
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize minimum effort and optimal steps configuration
min_effort = float('inf')
optimal_steps = None

# Check each permutation for the one that requires the least effort
for steps in generate_step_permutations(N, H, M):
    effort = calculate_effort(steps, M, p)
    if effort < min_effort:
        min_effort = effort
        optimal_steps = steps
    elif effort == min_effort and steps < optimal_steps:
        # If effort is the same, choose the lexicographically smaller one
        optimal_steps = steps

# Write the results to scara.out
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, optimal_steps)) + '\n')
```

This version of the code fixes the previous issues by correctly defining all necessary variables and including proper logic to calculate the effort. It generates valid permutations of step heights, calculates the effort for climbing each permutation within the constraints, and finds the permutation with the minimum effort needed. The results are then written to the file `scara.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the calculation of effort in the program is incorrect. Let's review the logic:

Ion can climb multiple steps at once, but the total height of the steps he climbs at once cannot exceed M. The effort for each set of steps climbed at once is the arithmetic mean of the heights plus a constant value p. The previous solution attempted to generate permutations and calculate the effort but did not correctly account for the possibility of climbing multiple steps in one leap within the constraint of M.

To fix this, we need a dynamic programming approach that minimizes the effort required by considering all possible combinations of steps Ion can climb at once. We'll calculate the minimum effort needed to reach each step and keep track of the steps so that we can reconstruct the optimal path at the end:

```python
# Read data from scara.in
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize DP table for storing minimum effort to reach each step
dp = [float('inf')] * (N + 1)
dp[0] = 0  # No effort needed to stay on the ground

# Table to reconstruct the steps taken
steps_taken = [-1] * (N + 1)

# Function to reconstruct the path of steps
def reconstruct_path(steps_taken, N):
    steps = []
    while N > 0:
        steps.append(steps_taken[N])
        N -= steps_taken[N]
    return steps[::-1]

# Dynamic programming to find minimum effort
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for j in range(1, min(i, M) + 1):  # Check for all possible jumps up to M
        # Calculate the sum of heights if this step is at height j
        sum_of_heights = sum(reconstruct_path(steps_taken, i - 1)) + j
        if sum_of_heights <= H and dp[i - j] + p + j < dp[i]:
            dp[i] = dp[i - j] + p + j
            steps_taken[i] = j

# Reconstruct the optimal steps
optimal_steps = reconstruct_path(steps_taken, N)

# Calculate the minimum total effort
min_effort = dp[N] - p  # Subtract the last added constant effort

# Write the results to scara.out
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, optimal_steps)) + '\n')
```

In this revised solution, we use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum effort required to reach each subsequent step, considering the option to climb multiple steps at once. We then reconstruct the path to find the actual steps taken and write the result to `scara.out`. This approach should give us the correct minimum effort and the corresponding heights of the steps.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that the dynamic programming solution provided did not successfully find the correct path of steps that Ion would take to minimize effort. The total height of the steps (sum of steps' heights) must be equal to H, and each step's height should be unique.

Since the number of steps N is relatively small (N <= 8), we can afford to use a brute force approach to explore all permutations of step heights and calculate the minimum effort needed to climb these steps under the given constraints. We should also ensure that the sum of the heights of any continuous subset of steps that Ion takes at once does not exceed M.

Let's re-implement the solution using a brute force approach:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Function to calculate the climbing effort for a given sequence of steps
def climbing_effort(steps, M, p):
    effort = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(steps):
        # Find the next sequence of steps that Ion can climb
        step_sequence = [steps[i]]
        while i + 1 < len(steps) and sum(step_sequence) + steps[i + 1] <= M:
            i += 1
            step_sequence.append(steps[i])
        # Add the effort for this sequence of steps
        effort += p + sum(step_sequence) / len(step_sequence)
        i += 1
    return effort

# Read the input data
with open('scara.in', 'r') as file:
    H, N, M, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate all possible permutations of step heights that sum up to H
all_heights = [h for h in range(1, H + 1)]
step_permutations = [perm for perm in permutations(all_heights, N) if sum(perm) == H]

# Find the permutation with the minimum climbing effort
min_effort = float('inf')
min_permutation = None
for perm in step_permutations:
    effort = climbing_effort(perm, M, p)
    if effort < min_effort or (effort == min_effort and (min_permutation is None or perm < min_permutation)):
        min_effort = effort
        min_permutation = perm

# Write the results
with open('scara.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_effort:.2f}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, min_permutation)) + '\n')
```

This revised solution generates all valid permutations of step heights and calculates the effort required to climb these steps. It then finds the permutation with the minimum effort, ensuring that the sum of any continuous subset of steps taken does not exceed M. The output is written to `scara.out` as expected.
