Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read data from file

    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = np.array([list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)], dtype=np.int32)

# Initialize the cost matrix with high values
cost = np.full((m, n), np.inf, dtype=np.float32)
# Set the cost of the first cell to its value since the lacusta must start there
cost[0, 0] = grid[0, 0]

# Compute the cost to reach each cell in the matrix
for i in range(1, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # Calculate the minimum cost of reaching the cell right above the current cell
        min_above = np.min(cost[i-1])
        # The cost to reach the current cell is the value of the cell plus the minimum cost above
        cost[i, j] = grid[i, j] + min_above
        # We can't land on the same cell when moving vertically, so we need to account for that
        # If the minimum above was the cell right above the current cell, we need to take the second minimum
        if cost[i-1, j] == min_above:
            second_min_above = np.partition(cost[i-1].flatten(), 1)[1]
            cost[i, j] = grid[i, j] + second_min_above

# Since the last move is horizontal only, we need to add the value of the last cell
# to the minimum cost of the cells in the second to last row, excluding the last cell
min_second_last_row = np.min(cost[-2, :-1])
result = min_second_last_row + grid[-1, -1]

# Write the result to file
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{int(result)}\n")
```

This python code uses numpy for efficient matrix operations and minimizes memory usage. It does not use `input()` or `print()` functions for I/O operations and is optimized for both time and memory usage. The code should be saved to a `.py` file and executed with the `lacusta.in` file in the same directory to read the input and generate the `lacusta.out` file with the correct output.

The error you're seeing indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment where the code is run. Since the challenge specifies that we must optimize for both time and memory and encourages the use of highly efficient libraries like `numpy`, this is surprising.

However, since the code must run in an environment where `numpy` is unavailable, we need to rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other third-party libraries, relying instead on Python's standard libraries. Here's a rewritten solution using only built-in Python functionality to solve the challenge:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix with high values
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
# Set the cost of the first cell to its value since the lacusta must start there
cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]

# Compute the cost to reach each cell in the matrix
for i in range(1, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # Calculate the minimum cost of reaching the cell right above the current cell
        min_above = min(cost[i-1])
        # The cost to reach the current cell is the value of the cell plus the minimum cost above
        cost[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min_above
        # We can't land on the same cell when moving vertically, so we need to account for that
        # If the minimum above was the cell right above the current cell, we need to take the second minimum
        if cost[i-1][j] == min_above:
            second_min_above = sorted(cost[i-1])[1]
            cost[i][j] = grid[i][j] + second_min_above

# Since the last move is horizontal only, we need to add the value of the last cell
# to the minimum cost of the cells in the second to last row, excluding the last cell
min_second_last_row = min(cost[-2][:-1])
result = min_second_last_row + grid[-1][-1]

# Write the result to file
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{int(result)}\n")
```

This code follows the same logic as the original solution but does not use `numpy`. It uses lists to represent the matrix and iterates over the list to compute costs. It then writes the final result to the output file.

The found output is wrong because the logic in the code that updates the `cost[i][j]` is incorrect. The code is mistakenly taking the minimum cost from the previous row without considering that when moving vertically, the lacusta cannot land on the same column it started from, except for the first move.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly compute the cost to move from one cell in the previous row to the current cell, ensuring that we do not choose the cell directly above if it has the minimum cost. 

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix with high values
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
# Set the cost of the first cell to its value since the lacusta must start there
cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]
# Initialize the second row of the cost matrix, as the first move can be only one step down
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1][j] = grid[0][0] + grid[1][j]

# Compute the cost to reach each cell starting from the second row
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # We are looking for two smallest costs from the previous row, excluding the current column
        prev_costs = cost[i - 1][:j] + cost[i - 1][j + 1:]
        two_smallest = sorted(prev_costs)[:2]
        # Check which one is not directly above the current cell
        for smallest in two_smallest:
            if j == 0 or cost[i - 1][j - 1] != smallest:
                min_cost_above = smallest
                break
        # The cost to reach the current cell is the value of the cell plus the minimum cost above
        cost[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min_cost_above

# Since the last move is horizontal only, we need to add the value of the last cell to the minimum cost of the second to last row
min_second_last_row = min(cost[-2])
result = min_second_last_row + grid[-1][-1]

# Write the result to file
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{int(result)}\n")
```

This corrected solution should produce the expected output `28`. The main change in the algorithm is the addition of logic to find two smallest costs from the previous row, excluding the current column, and to choose the minimum cost among them that is not from the cell directly above the current cell. The second row cost initialization is also added to ensure the first move is correctly represented.

The output is still incorrect due to a misunderstanding in the algorithm used to calculate the cost. When moving from one row to another, we need to consider the sum of two consecutive cells (the cell in the current row and the cell in the next row) for each step. Moreover, we cannot land in the same column after a vertical move, except on the last move which is horizontal only.

Let's rewrite the algorithm with the correct logic:

- Initialize cost at the starting cell (0,0) with the value in the grid.
- For the second row, calculate the cost of reaching each cell as the sum of the first cell (0,0) and the cell itself.
- For subsequent rows, calculate the cost of reaching each cell as the minimum sum of two cells from the previous row (excluding the column directly above) plus the value of the current cell.
- The final cost is the minimum cost in the second to last row plus the cost of the bottom-right cell.

Here is the corrected Python solution:

```python
def read_input():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    return m, n, grid

def write_output(value):
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(value))

def find_min_sum_path(m, n, grid):
    # Initialize cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Pre-fill the second row (first actual move)
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = grid[0][0] + grid[1][j]
    
    # Calculate costs for each cell starting from the second row
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Look for the minimum cost to reach this cell from the previous row
            for k in range(n):
                if k != j:
                    cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], grid[i][j] + grid[i-1][k] + cost[i-1][k])

    # Add the cost of final cell to the minimum value found in the second to last row
    last_row_min = min(cost[m-2][j] + grid[m-1][j] for j in range(n-1))
    result = last_row_min + grid[m-1][n-1]
    return result

# Main execution
m, n, grid = read_input()
result = find_min_sum_path(m, n, grid)
write_output(result)
```

This solution should provide the expected result of 28 for the given input. It takes into account the correct traversal rules as described in the challenge and writes the final output to 'lacusta.out'.

The previous solutions contained logical errors. The main mistake was in the way we calculated the cost for each cell, which did not follow the rules of the problem correctly. The problem states that each move consists of a horizontal leap and then a vertical step. In other words, we must select two cells on each row, except for the last row where we only perform a horizontal leap to the bottom-right corner. We must ensure that the horizontal leap does not land on the cell above the vertical step destination.

Let's rewrite the algorithm with the correct logic, considering the constraints of the problem:

1. We start at the top-left corner and finish at the bottom-right corner.
2. From each cell on the first row, we can move horizontally to any other cell in the same row.
3. After the horizontal leap, we move down one cell vertically (no choice in this vertical step).
4. We repeat this process until we reach the last row, where our final move is a horizontal leap to the last cell.
5. The sum should be minimized.

Here is the corrected Python solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as f:
    m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]
# The first move can only be a step down
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1][j] = grid[0][0] + grid[1][j]

# Calculate minimum cost for each cell starting from the second row
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # For each cell, consider the cost of coming from every possible cell in the previous row
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j: # We cannot leap to the cell directly above
                cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + grid[i][k] + grid[i][j])

# On the last move, we only make a horizontal leap to the last cell
min_cost_last_row = min(cost[m-2][j] + grid[m-1][j] for j in range(n))
result = min_cost_last_row + grid[m-1][-1]

# Write output to file
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now provide the expected result of `28` for the given input. The algorithm now correctly respects the problem's rules for horizontal and vertical movements, and avoids landing on the same column after a vertical step (except for the last horizontal leap).
