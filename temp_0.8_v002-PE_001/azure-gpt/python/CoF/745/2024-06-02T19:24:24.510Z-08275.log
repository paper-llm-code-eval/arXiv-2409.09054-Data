Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Let's read the input
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = np.array([list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)], dtype=np.int32)
    
# Initialize the cost array with infinity, and set the starting point cost.
cost = np.full((m, n), np.inf, dtype=np.int32)
cost[0, 0] = matrix[0, 0]

# Compute the cost for the first two rows explicitly as they are special cases
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1, j] = matrix[0, 0] + matrix[1, j] + matrix[1, 0]

# Iterate over the remaining rows
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # Find the two minimum costs from the previous row to reach the j-th position in the i-th row
        # excluding the cost to move from the previous row's j-th position to current row's j-th position
        # because we cannot move vertically down.
        prev_min1 = prev_min2 = np.inf
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j:
                cost_val = cost[i - 1, k] + matrix[i, j]
                if cost_val < prev_min1:
                    prev_min2 = prev_min1
                    prev_min1 = cost_val
                elif cost_val < prev_min2:
                    prev_min2 = cost_val
        # Update the cost of reaching the current cell in the i-th row
        cost[i, j] += min(prev_min1, prev_min2)

# Exclude the first column when looking for the minimum in the last row
# because we cannot move from the bottom-left corner to the bottom-right corner directly.
min_cost = np.min(cost[m - 1, 1:]) + matrix[m - 1, 0]

# Write the result to the output file
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution takes into account the memory constraints, by using `numpy` arrays with `dtype=np.int32` to reduce memory usage. It iterates through the matrix efficiently, avoiding unnecessary recomputations, and stores the minimum cost to reach each cell. The final result is calculated by considering the special cases for the first two rows and the last row.

The provided Python environment does not have the `numpy` library installed, which is causing the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Since we are limited by memory and cannot install additional libraries, we will have to solve the problem using standard Python data structures and not rely on `numpy`.

Here's the updated solution using standard Python lists:

```python
# We'll use a helper function to get the two smallest elements in a list
# that excludes a specific index.
def two_smallest(lst, exclude_index):
    smallest = second_smallest = float('inf')
    for idx, value in enumerate(lst):
        if idx != exclude_index:
            if value < smallest:
                second_smallest = smallest
                smallest = value
            elif value < second_smallest:
                second_smallest = value
    return smallest, second_smallest

# Read input data
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

# Compute the cost for the first two rows
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][j] + matrix[1][0]

# Compute the cost for the remaining rows
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # Find the two smallest costs from the previous row, excluding the current column
        prev_min1, prev_min2 = two_smallest(cost[i - 1], j)
        cost[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + min(prev_min1, prev_min2)

# Find the minimum cost in the last row, excluding the first column
min_cost = min(cost[m - 1][1:]) + matrix[m - 1][0]

# Write the output data
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution respects the memory limit by using standard lists and avoids using any external libraries. The memory footprint should be within the ~8MB limit for the given constraints of the problem. The helper function `two_smallest` ensures that we only keep the two smallest values needed for the computation, which contributes to the efficiency of the solution.

The error in the previous solution likely stems from mishandling the traversal conditions, especially concerning the last move which only involves a horizontal jump without a vertical step.

To correct the solution, we need to make sure we are properly handling the conditions for the first and last line. Also, we need to ensure that we are not jumping over the cell immediately below the current cell in each move.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

# Compute the cost for the first two rows
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][j]

# Compute the cost for the remaining rows
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # For each cell in the i-th row, calculate the cost from the previous row.
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j:
                cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j])

# Calculate the cost to reach the last cell from the second-to-last row
min_cost = float('inf')
for j in range(n - 1):  # We can't move vertically down from the last cell, so we exclude it
    min_cost = min(min_cost, cost[m - 2][j] + matrix[m - 1][j])

# Add the value of the last cell
min_cost += matrix[m - 1][n - 1]

# Write the output data
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution correctly accounts for the special rules of the traversal, especially for the first two rows and the last move. It ensures that we do not jump over the cell immediately below the current cell when calculating the minimum cost to reach each cell. The final cost is calculated by considering all possible last moves from the second-to-last row, excluding the immediate jump from the last cell of the second-to-last row to the last cell of the last row. After finding the minimum cost to reach the last row (excluding the last cell), we add the value of the last cell to determine the final minimum cost.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's re-evaluate the problem and implement a correct solution.

The key insight to this problem is that for each cell, except for those in the first and last rows, we need to find the cheapest path from a cell in the previous row that is not directly above it (since vertical downward moves are not allowed). Additionally, we need to handle the special case when moving from the second-to-last row to the last row, where we can only make a horizontal jump to the bottom-right corner.

Taking these into consideration, here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
cost[1][0] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][0]

# Fill the cost for the first two rows explicitly since they are special
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1][j] = cost[1][0] + matrix[1][j]

# Compute the cost for the remaining rows
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # Calculate the cost for each cell
        # We cannot move directly vertically downwards, so we find the minimum cost from the previous row
        # excluding the direct vertical cell.
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j:
                cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j])

# Handle the last move which is a horizontal jump without a vertical step
# We need to add the costs of the second-to-last and last cells from the second-to-last row
last_move_costs = [
    cost[m - 2][j] + matrix[m - 1][j] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1] for j in range(n - 1)
]

# The total cost includes the last move and the value of the first cell
min_cost = min(last_move_costs) + matrix[0][0]

# Write the output data
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution keeps track of the minimum cost to reach each cell, with special handling for the first two rows and the last move. The final cost calculation includes the value of the first cell since it's counted twice in the traversal. The corrected algorithm should now produce the expected result.

I apologize for the continued issues with the solution. Let's carefully re-examine the problem requirements and constraints to ensure we understand the traversal rules correctly:

1. We start in the top-left corner and must reach the bottom-right corner.
2. Each move consists of a horizontal jump followed by a vertical step (except for the last move, which is only a horizontal jump).
3. We must visit `2 * m` cells, since we must touch each row twice.
4. We cannot move directly downwards, meaning that each horizontal jump must be to a different column than the current one before moving downwards.

Given these rules, let's re-implement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Read input data
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
cost[1][0] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][0]

# We start from the second row since the first row is only the starting point
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j:
                # We consider the cost of landing on the current row (matrix[i][j]) from each possible column (k) of the previous row.
                # The cost[i - 1][k] is the minimum cost to reach the k-th column of the (i-1)-th row.
                cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j])

# Calculate the cost of the last row transitions
for j in range(1, n):
    for k in range(n):
        if k != j:
            cost[m - 1][j] = min(cost[m - 1][j], cost[m - 2][k] + matrix[m - 1][j] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1])

# The total cost is the minimum value in the last row excluding the first column plus the initial cost of the first cell
min_cost = min(cost[m - 1][1:])

# Write the output data
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution calculates the cost correctly by considering all possible previous positions for each cell and handling the last row separately. The cost of the last jump to the bottom-right corner is computed for every possible position in the second-to-last row, ensuring that the direct downward move is not used. The final cost does not add the cost of the first cell again, as it is already included in the initial cost setup. This should provide the correct output.

Let's reconsider the problem with a fresh perspective. We are required to perform a series of horizontal jumps followed by vertical steps, except for the very last move which is only a horizontal jump directly to the bottom right corner.

We need to ensure that the path we take includes the minimum possible cost, and that we account for the fact that we cannot make a vertical move directly downwards. Additionally, the cost of jumping from the second-to-last row to the last row requires special attention. Let me rewrite the solution taking into account these points:

```python
# Read input data
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [[int(x) for x in file.readline().split()] for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = 0  # Starting point, no cost

# Compute the cost for the first move (second row)
for col in range(1, n):
    cost[1][col] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][col]

# Compute the minimum cost for each cell starting from the second row
for row in range(2, m):
    for col in range(n):
        # For each cell, we need to consider the cost of reaching it from every other column in the previous row
        for prev_col in range(n):
            if prev_col != col:  # We cannot move directly downwards
                cost[row][col] = min(cost[row][col], cost[row-1][prev_col] + matrix[row][col])

# Compute the cost for the final move
# The final move only includes horizontal jumps from the second-to-last row to the last row
final_costs = []
for col in range(n - 1):  # We can't end on the last column since we have to jump from there to the end
    final_costs.append(cost[m - 2][col] + matrix[m - 1][col] + matrix[m - 1][n - 1])

min_cost = min(final_costs)

# The total cost includes the cost to reach the second-to-last row plus the final move
min_cost += matrix[0][0]  # Adding the cost of the starting cell

# Write the output data
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This revised solution initializes the cost of the first cell to 0, as we start from there, and the cost of reaching the first cell is not counted. The cost matrix is filled by considering all possible previous positions in the previous row, ensuring that a direct downward move is not considered. The final costs are calculated by considering all possible horizontal jumps from the second-to-last row to the last row, excluding the last column, as we can't jump from there. The total cost includes the cost of the starting cell, because the starting cell is visited twice according to the problem statement. This solution should now provide the expected output.

I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let's revise our approach and apply a dynamic programming technique that correctly adheres to the rules of the problem.

Since this problem involves finding the minimum sum of traversing the matrix while adhering to specific movement rules, we need to ensure that we're calculating the minimum path sum correctly at each cell as we move from the top-left to the bottom-right of the matrix.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

# In the first row, we can only move horizontally.
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[0][j] = float('inf')  # We cannot jump horizontally in the first row.

# From the second row, calculate the cost considering the movement rules.
for i in range(1, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # Calculate the minimum cost from the previous row to current cell
        # taking into account that we cannot move directly down.
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j:  # Exclude the vertical downward movement
                next_cost = cost[i - 1][k] + matrix[i][j]
                # If we are on the last row, we add the cost of jumping to the last cell.
                if i == m - 1 and k != n - 1:
                    next_cost += matrix[i][n - 1]
                cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], next_cost)

# The total cost is the minimum value in the last row.
min_cost = min(cost[-1])

# Write the output data
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This algorithm ensures that we exclude direct vertical movements and also handles the last movement correctly, which is a horizontal jump to the last cell of the matrix without a vertical step. The cost of each cell is calculated by considering the best path leading to it, which does not include any illegal moves. The final minimum cost is the minimum value found in the last row of the cost matrix, which represents the end of the traversal. This solution should now correctly compute the expected output.
