Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

6 6 3 4 4

Certainly! Below is the Python solution that reads from `lacusta.in` and writes the result to `lacusta.out` without using `input()` or `print()`. This solution optimizes for both time and memory usage, and uses NumPy for efficient computation.

```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Read the matrix from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as fin:
    m, n = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    matrix = np.array([list(map(int, fin.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)], dtype=np.int32)

# Initialize the cost matrix
cost = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=np.int32)
cost[0, 0] = matrix[0, 0]

# Fill in the second row (first move can only land on the second row)
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1, j] = cost[0, 0] + matrix[1, j]

# Update costs for subsequent positions
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # We can come to the current cell either from the cell directly above,
        # or by taking a leap from any cell in the previous row except the one above.
        # We choose the minimum of these options.
        costs_with_leaps = cost[i-1] + matrix[i-1] + matrix[i]
        costs_with_leaps[j] = np.inf  # We cannot leap from the cell directly above
        cost[i, j] = np.min(costs_with_leaps)

# For the last move, we can only reach the bottom-right corner from the cells above it.
min_cost_from_above = np.min(cost[-2, :-1])  # Exclude the bottom-right corner itself for this move
total_min_cost = min_cost_from_above + matrix[-1, -1]

# Write the result to 'lacusta.out'
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(str(total_min_cost))
```
```

This code assumes that the provided `lacusta.in` file exists and is correctly formatted according to the problem statement. The solution uses NumPy arrays to hold the matrix and cost values. It calculates the minimum cost to traverse the matrix and writes the final result to `lacusta.out`. The code makes use of efficient NumPy operations and respects the memory limitation by using `np.int32` for cost calculations.

I apologize for the oversight. Below is the corrected solution that adheres to the problem constraints and reads from `lacusta.in` and writes to `lacusta.out`.

```python
import numpy as np

# Read the matrix from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=np.int32)
    for i in range(m):
        matrix[i] = np.array(file.readline().split(), dtype=np.int32)

# Initialize the cost array
cost = np.full((m, n), np.inf, dtype=np.int32)
cost[0, 0] = matrix[0, 0]
cost[1, 1:] = matrix[0, 0] + matrix[1, 1:] + matrix[1, 0]

# Process the rest of the rows
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # When on the last row, we only consider the previous row's costs
        prev_costs = cost[i-1] if i < m-1 else cost[i-1, 1:]
        # Exclude the cost of landing on the same column
        prev_costs[j] = np.inf
        cost[i, j] = matrix[i, j] + matrix[i-1, j] + np.min(prev_costs)

# The final move is a horizontal jump to the last cell from any of the cells in the second to last row
final_cost = cost[-2, 1:] + matrix[-1, 1]
min_cost = matrix[-1, -1] + np.min(final_cost)

# Write the result to 'lacusta.out'
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This script carefully respects the memory limit and uses NumPy for efficient array operations. It avoids using the `input()` and `print()` functions and instead reads and writes directly to the files. The `np.inf` is used to initialize the cost array, and it's updated as the program iterates through the rows of the matrix. The final minimum cost is calculated and written to `lacusta.out`.

It appears that the environment where this code is being executed does not have the NumPy library installed, as indicated by the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Since the memory constraints are strict and external libraries cannot be used, I will rewrite the solution without using NumPy or any other third-party libraries, only standard Python.

```python
# Read the matrix from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost array
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

# Fill the second row
for j in range(1, n):
    cost[1][j] = matrix[0][0] + matrix[1][0] + matrix[1][j]

# Fill in the rest of the cost matrix
for i in range(2, m):
    for j in range(n):
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j:
                cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i-1][j])

# Calculate the minimum cost of the last move
last_move_costs = [cost[m-2][j] + matrix[m-1][j] for j in range(n-1)]
min_last_move_cost = min(last_move_costs)

# The total minimum cost to reach the bottom right corner
min_cost = min_last_move_cost + matrix[m-1][n-1]

# Write the result to 'lacusta.out'
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution uses only built-in Python functionality and should run in any Python environment. It performs the same calculations as the previous NumPy-based solution but uses nested lists to represent the matrix and cost data structures.

The issue with the previous solution is that it did not properly account for the constraints of the problem, specifically the part where it says a "traversal consists of multiple movements" and "the last movement (when we are on the last line) will consist only of a leap." This implies a specific traversal pattern, which the previous solution did not correctly implement.

Here's the corrected solution, which should now follow the rules of traversal as specified in the problem statement:

```python
# Read the matrix from 'lacusta.in'
with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Initialize the cost array
cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
cost[0][0] = matrix[0][0]

# Traverse the matrix as per the problem statement
for i in range(1, m):
    for j in range(n):
        # On the last line we only perform a horizontal leap
        if i == m - 1:
            if j < n - 1:
                continue
            cost[i][j] = min([cost[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j])
        else:
            for k in range(n):
                # We cannot stay in the same column after moving vertically
                if k != j:
                    # We can only move to the cell immediately below or perform a leap
                    cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i-1][k] + matrix[i][j] + matrix[i+1][j])

# The total minimum cost to reach the bottom right corner
min_cost = cost[m-1][n-1]

# Write the result to 'lacusta.out'
with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This revised solution should now correctly implement the movement rules by considering the vertical step and the horizontal leap in each movement, except for the last line where only a horizontal leap to the bottom right corner is allowed. It takes care to avoid horizontal leaps to the same column and minimizes the total traversal cost as required.
