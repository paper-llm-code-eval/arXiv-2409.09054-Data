Se consideră o matrice dreptunghiulară cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu valori naturale. Traversăm matricea pornind de la colţul stânga-sus la colţul dreapta-jos. O traversare constă din mai multe deplasări. La fiecare deplasare se execută un salt pe orizontală şi un pas pe verticală. Un salt înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la oricare alta aflată pe aceeaşi linie, iar un pas înseamnă că putem trece de la o celulă la celula aflată imediat sub ea. Excepţie face ultima deplasare (cea în care ne aflăm pe ultima linie), când vom face doar un salt pentru a ajunge în colţul dreapta-jos, dar nu vom mai face şi pasul corespunzător. Astfel traversarea va consta din vizitarea a $2 \cdot m$ celule. 

# Cerinţă

Scrieţi un program care să determine suma minimă care se poate obţine pentru o astfel de traversare.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `lacusta.in` conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un spaţiu $m \ n$, reprezentând numărul de linii şi respectiv numărul de coloane ale matricei. Pe următoarele $m$ linii este descrisă matricea, câte $n$ numere pe fiecare linie, separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `lacusta.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care va fi scrisă suma minimă găsită.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* Valorile elementelor matricei sunt numere întregi din intervalul $[1, 255]$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def main():
    # Read the input from file
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as f:
        m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
        grid = np.array([list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)], dtype=np.int32)

    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = np.full((m, n), np.inf, dtype=np.float32)
    cost[0, 0] = grid[0, 0]
    
    # Calculate the cost for the first two rows
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1, j] = grid[0, 0] + grid[1, j] + grid[0, j]
    
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Get the minimum value of previous row except the value directly above
            previous_row = cost[i-1, :].copy()
            previous_row[j] = np.inf
            min_prev_row = np.min(previous_row)
            
            # The cost is the minimum of the previous row (excluding the cell directly above) plus current cell
            cost[i, j] = min_prev_row + grid[i, j]
    
    # Add the values of the last row except the last cell
    last_row = cost[-2, :] + grid[-1, :]
    last_row[-1] = np.inf
    
    # The minimum cost to reach the last cell
    min_last_row = np.min(last_row)
    
    # Write the output to file
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as f:
        # The total cost includes the cost to reach the last cell and the value of the last cell
        f.write(str(int(min_last_row + grid[-1, -1])))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The above code reads a matrix from `lacusta.in` and calculates the minimum sum for a traversal where we move horizontally and then vertically downwards in each step, except for the last move that is only horizontal. It optimizes memory usage by using Numpy arrays, which are more memory-efficient than Python lists, and performs in-place updates to the cost matrix to avoid unnecessary memory allocation. The output is written to `lacusta.out`.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since the challenge requires optimizing both time and memory usage, and `numpy` is one of the most efficient libraries for such tasks, its absence is a significant limitation. However, given the constraints of the environment, I will rewrite the solution to work without `numpy`.

Here is a non-`numpy` solution that tries to be as memory efficient as possible within the Python standard library's capabilities:

```python
def main():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as f:
        m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]

    # Calculate the cost for the first two rows
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = grid[0][0] + grid[1][j] + grid[0][j]

    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Get the minimum value of previous row except the value directly above
            min_prev_row = min(cost[i-1][:j] + cost[i-1][j+1:])

            # The cost is the minimum of the previous row (excluding the cell directly above) plus current cell
            cost[i][j] = min_prev_row + grid[i][j]

    # Add the values of the last row except the last cell
    last_row = [cost[-2][j] + grid[-1][j] for j in range(n)]
    last_row[-1] = float('inf')
    
    # The minimum cost to reach the last cell
    min_last_row = min(last_row)

    # Write the output to file
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as f:
        # The total cost includes the cost to reach the last cell and the value of the last cell
        f.write(str(min_last_row + grid[-1][-1]))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution uses plain Python lists instead of `numpy` arrays. It implements the same logic as the previous solution, using a two-dimensional list to store the cost matrix. Memory efficiency is maintained by not creating additional lists except for a temporary list used to calculate the minimum value in the previous row. The output is written to `lacusta.out` with the same formatting as before.

Upon reviewing the code and the rules of the challenge, it seems I made a mistake in the implementation. Specifically, the cost of reaching each cell on the 2nd to last row was incorrectly calculated, as it did not consider the constraint that the jump from the second-to-last row to the last row must be horizontal only, and cannot involve the cell directly above the last cell.

This means that while we calculate the minimum path cost, we must also ensure that the second-to-last jump does not come from the cell above the bottom right corner cell.

Let's fix this and write the entire solution again:

```python
def main():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as f:
        m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

    # Initialize the cost matrix
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]

    # Compute costs for the second row, based on the rules
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = grid[0][0] + grid[1][j]

    # Compute minimum path sums for each cell, starting from the second row
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            # We can jump to this cell from any cell in the previous row except the one directly above
            for k in range(n):
                if k != j:
                    cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i - 1][k] + grid[i][j])

    # For the last jump, we can't come from directly above, so find the minimum second-to-last step cost
    second_to_last_costs = [cost[m - 2][j] + grid[m - 1][k] for j in range(n) for k in range(n) if j != k]

    # The minimum cost to reach the last cell includes the last cell's cost
    min_cost = min(second_to_last_costs) + grid[-1][-1]

    # Write the output to file
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(min_cost))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This corrected solution now correctly considers the special rule for the last jump and should produce the correct minimum sum for the traversal. The code reads the matrix from `lacusta.in`, calculates the minimum sum based on the challenge rules, and writes the solution to `lacusta.out`.

The difference in the expected and found result suggests there is a flaw in the algorithm used to calculate the minimum traversal sum. Upon careful evaluation, the previous solution has two primary issues:

1. When calculating costs for cells after the first row, it attempted to calculate a cumulative minimum without ensuring that two consecutive vertical steps are not taken.
2. The calculation for the second-to-last and last rows was incorrect, as it did not take into account that the lacusta cannot move vertically down on the last move.

Let's fix these issues and write the correct solution:

```python
def main():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as f:
        m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

    # Initialize the cost matrix with infinity
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    # The cost of the first cell is its own value
    cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]

    # Precompute the minimum cost to reach each cell on the second row
    for col in range(1, n):
        # Must jump from the first cell to any other cell in the second row
        cost[1][col] = grid[0][0] + grid[1][col]

    # Compute the cost for the rest of the rows
    for row in range(2, m):
        for col in range(n):
            # We will take the minimum cost of all cells in the previous row, 
            # except the one directly above the current cell
            for prev_col in range(n):
                if prev_col != col:  # Cannot move vertically down
                    cost[row][col] = min(cost[row][col], cost[row-1][prev_col] + grid[row][col])

    # The last move is special, as we can only move horizontally to the bottom-right cell
    # We need to find the minimum cost to reach any cell in the second-to-last row
    # and add the cost of moving from there to the bottom-right cell
    min_cost_to_last_row = min(cost[m-2][col] + grid[m-1][col] for col in range(n-1))

    # Add the cost of the bottom-right cell to get the total minimum cost
    total_min_cost = min_cost_to_last_row + grid[m-1][n-1]

    # Write the output to 'lacusta.out'
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(total_min_cost))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

By implementing the above solution:

- We correctly precompute the costs to reach any cell in the second row.
- We then use dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost to reach any cell in each subsequent row, with the restriction that we cannot move directly vertically downwards.
- For the last move, we correctly only consider horizontal movement, by finding the minimum cost to any cell in the second-to-last row, but excluding the last column since we cannot move vertically down to the bottom-right cell.
- Finally, we add the cost of the bottom-right cell to the computed minimum cost to get the total minimum cost of traversal.

Upon re-evaluating the problem and the code, I've identified the mistake in the previous implementation. When calculating the minimum cost for the second-to-last row, I did not correctly handle the rule that the second-to-last jump cannot land on the last column. Additionally, for each cell in the second-to-last row, we must consider the minimum cost of every other cell in that row plus the cost of the next horizontal jump to the last row.

Let's fix the code to correctly handle the special rules for the last few moves:

```python
def main():
    with open('lacusta.in', 'r') as f:
        m, n = map(int, f.readline().split())
        grid = [list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]

    # Initialize the cost matrix with infinity and set the first cell's cost to its grid value
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = grid[0][0]

    # Calculate the cost for moving from the first cell to any cell in the second row
    for j in range(1, n):
        cost[1][j] = grid[0][0] + grid[1][j]

    # For the rest of the rows, calculate the cost for each cell
    for i in range(2, m):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                if k != j:  # Cannot move vertically down, so k must be different from j
                    cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j], cost[i - 1][k] + grid[i][j])

    # Now handle the special case of the second-to-last and last row
    # We need to calculate the minimum possible cost to reach the second-to-last row's cells
    # while excluding direct vertical movement to the last cell
    min_cost_second_to_last = float('inf')
    for j in range(n):
        for k in range(n):
            if k != j:  # Cannot end in the last cell's column
                # Update minimum cost if the sum of the cost to get to the second-to-last cell,
                # the horizontal jump to the last row, and the final cell's cost is less than the current minimum
                min_cost_second_to_last = min(min_cost_second_to_last, cost[m-2][j] + grid[m-1][k])

    # Add the cost of the final cell to the minimum cost to get to the last row
    total_min_cost = min_cost_second_to_last + grid[m-1][n-1]

    # Write the total minimum cost to the 'lacusta.out' file
    with open('lacusta.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(total_min_cost))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this corrected solution, we specifically handle the second-to-last row's calculation, ensuring the lacusta does not land in the last column directly above the last cell. We then calculate the minimum cost for all possible horizontal jumps to the last row and pick the smallest one, to which we add the cost of the last cell. This should yield the correct minimum traversal sum and produce the expected output.
