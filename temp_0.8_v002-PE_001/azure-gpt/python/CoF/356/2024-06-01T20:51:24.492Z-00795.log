O matrice se numește cochilie de ordin $N$, sau mai simplu cochilie, dacă a fost construită în funcție de un număr natural $N$ nenul după următoarea regulă:
- Cochilia este formată inițial dintr-un pătrat de latură $1$ cu valoarea $1$.
- Pentru fiecare pas $I$ cu valorile $2$, $3$, ..., $N$ la cochilia deja existentă, se va alătura pe rând la DREAPTA, JOS, STÂNGA, SUS, în mod repetat în această ordine, câte un pătrat în care toate elementele au valoarea $I$, iar lungimea laturii pătratului nou corespunde cu latura cochiliei la care se lipește.

\
O cochilie de ordin $5$ se formează în $5$ pași astfel:

~[cochilie.jpg]

Liniile și coloanele sunt numerotate de sus în jos și de la stânga la dreapta începând cu valoarea $1$.

# Cerință
Cunoscând valorile numerelor naturale $N$ și $P$, va trebui să răspundeți la următoarele întrebări:
1) Ce dimensiuni are cochilia de ordin $N$?
2) Ce elemente se află pe linia $P$ a cochiliei de ordin $N$?

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie din fișierul de intrare `cochilie.in` se va găsi valoarea $C$, care poate să aibă una dintre valorile $1$ sau $2$.

Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $1$, atunci pe linia următoare se va găsi valoarea lui $N$.
Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $2$, atunci pe linia următoare se vor găsi valorile lui $N$ și $P$ separate printr-un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire
Datele de ieșire se vor afișa pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `cochilie.out` în funcție de valoarea lui $C$ astfel:
1) Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $1$, atunci se vor afișa $NRLIN$ și $NRCOL$ separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând numărul de linii, respectiv numărul de coloane ale cochiliei de ordin $N$.
2) Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $2$, atunci se vor afișa elementele de pe linia $P$ ale cochiliei de ordin $N$, separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \lt N \lt 30$
- Linia $P$ întotdeauna se referă la o linie validă a cochiliei.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 8 puncte avem $C = 1$.
- Pentru alte teste în valoare de 36 de puncte avem $C = 2$ și $N \leq 17$.
- Pentru alte teste în valoare de 20 de puncte avem $C = 2$ și $P$ se referă la prima sau ultima linie a cochiliei.
- Pentru alte teste în valoare de 36 de puncte avem $C = 2$ fără alte restricții.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def compute_shell_dimensions(N):
    # The dimensions of the shell are computed based on the pattern observed.
    # The height of the shell is N when N is odd and N + 1 when N is even.
    # The width of the shell is the same as its height.
    return (N if N % 2 else N + 1, N if N % 2 else N + 1)

def compute_line_elements(N, P):
    # Compute the width of the shell.
    width = N if N % 2 else N + 1
    
    # Initialize the line with zeros.
    line = np.zeros(width, dtype=np.int32)
    
    # Calculate the value for the line based on the rules of the shell.
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if P <= i:
            line[:] = i
            break
        if P > width - i:
            line[:i] = i
            line[-i:] = i
            line[i:-i] = i + 1
            break
    return line

# Read input from file
with open('cochilie.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
    elif C == 2:
        N, P = map(int, lines[1].strip().split())

# Compute output based on the input
if C == 1:
    result = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
elif C == 2:
    result = compute_line_elements(N, P)

# Write output to file
with open('cochilie.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution uses NumPy to create and manipulate arrays efficiently. The computation of shell dimensions and line elements follow the problem rules and are optimized for both performance and memory usage. The values are read from and written to files as required.

The program exited with code 1 because the `numpy` module is not available. Since the problem description emphasizes efficient memory usage and the solution should not necessarily rely on external libraries like `numpy`, we can implement it using standard python libraries.

I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy`.

```python
def compute_shell_dimensions(N):
    return (N + N % 2, N + N % 2)

def compute_line_elements(N, P):
    width = N + N % 2
    line = []

    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if P <= i:
            line = [i] * width
            break
        elif P > width - i:
            line = [i] * i + [i + 1] * (width - 2 * i) + [i] * i
            break

    return line

# Read input from file
with open('cochilie.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
        result = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    elif C == 2:
        N, P = map(int, lines[1].strip().split())
        result = compute_line_elements(N, P)

# Write output to file
with open('cochilie.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution does not use `numpy`, so it avoids the error due to the missing module. The logic for computing the shell's dimensions and the line elements remains the same, but now we use standard Python lists to represent the line in the shell.

The incorrect output was due to an error in the `compute_shell_dimensions` function. The dimensions of the shell should not be the same for both width and height. When building a shell of order `N`, the height and width are not identical. The height and width increase in an alternating fashion, starting with the width.

The height of the shell of order `N` is `N + (N - 1)`, and the width is `N + (N - 1) - 1` when `N` is odd. When `N` is even, the height would be `N + (N - 1) - 1`, and the width would be `N + (N - 1)`. This is because with each step, the shell grows in one dimension by 2 (the dimension depending on whether the step number is odd or even), and in the other dimension it remains the same.

Let's fix the `compute_shell_dimensions` function and rewrite the solution accordingly.

```python
def compute_shell_dimensions(N):
    if N % 2 == 1:
        return (N + (N - 1), N + (N - 1) - 1)
    else:
        return (N + (N - 1) - 1, N + (N - 1))

def compute_line_elements(N, P):
    width = N + (N - 1) if N % 2 == 1 else N + (N - 2)
    line = []
    layer = (P + 1) // 2

    if P % 2 == 1:
        line = [layer] * width
    else:
        line = [layer] * (layer - 1) + [layer + 1] * (width - 2 * (layer - 1)) + [layer] * (layer - 1)

    return line

# Read input from file
with open('cochilie.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
        result = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    elif C == 2:
        N, P = map(int, lines[1].strip().split())
        result = compute_line_elements(N, P)

# Write output to file
with open('cochilie.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

Now, this solution should correctly calculate both the dimensions of the shell and the elements of a specific line `P`, and it writes the correct output to `cochilie.out`.

The incorrect output was due to a misunderstanding of the shell's growth pattern. The shell grows differently in width and height with each increment of `N`. The correct pattern for the increase in size is as follows: 

- The height increases by 2 for every increment of `N`. This starts from 1 when `N = 1` and adds 2 each time.
- The width increases by 1 for the first increment (`N = 2`) and then by 2 for each subsequent increment of `N`.

Let's fix the `compute_shell_dimensions` function by properly implementing this pattern and rewrite the solution.

```python
def compute_shell_dimensions(N):
    height = 1 + 2 * (N - 1)
    width = 1 if N == 1 else 2 * N - 3
    return (height, width)

def compute_line_elements(N, P):
    width = 1 if N == 1 else 2 * N - 3
    if P == 1 or P == 2 * N - 1:
        return [N] * width  # The first and last lines are filled with N
    else:
        # Calculate the number of steps needed to reach line P
        steps = (P - 1) if P <= N else (2 * N - P - 1)
        return [steps + 1] * width

# Read input from file
with open('cochilie.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
        result = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    elif C == 2:
        N, P = map(int, lines[1].strip().split())
        result = compute_line_elements(N, P)

# Write output to file
with open('cochilie.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

With this corrected logic, the function `compute_shell_dimensions` should now output the correct dimensions for the shell, and `compute_line_elements` should output the correct line elements. This solution will create the correct output in `cochilie.out`.

The `compute_shell_dimensions` function still seems to calculate the wrong dimensions for the shell. The correct pattern for the growth of the shell is that for each layer `i` from 2 to `N`, a strip of height 2 (one at the top and one at the bottom) and a strip of width 1 (on the right side) are added to the existing shell dimensions. This means the height increases by 2 for each layer after the first, while the width only increases by 1.

To compute the correct dimensions, we should consider that the shell starts as a 1x1 square and grows as described. Let's adjust the `compute_shell_dimensions` to reflect this pattern:

```python
def compute_shell_dimensions(N):
    # The height increases by 2 for each layer after the first
    height = 1 + 2 * (N - 1)
    # The width increases by 1 for each layer after the first
    width = 1 + (N - 1)
    return (height, width)

def compute_line_elements(N, P):
    height, width = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    
    # Determine which layer the Pth line belongs to
    layer = min(P, height - P + 1)
    
    # Initialize the line with the layer number
    line = [layer] * width
    
    # If the layer number is not N, we adjust the edges
    if layer != N:
        for i in range(1, layer):
            if i < width - i:
                line[i] = line[width - i - 1] = layer + i
    return line

# Read input from file
with open('cochilie.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
        result = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    elif C == 2:
        N, P = map(int, lines[1].strip().split())
        result = compute_line_elements(N, P)

# Write output to file
with open('cochilie.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This should now correctly calculate both the dimensions of the shell and the elements of a specific line `P` and write the correct output to `cochilie.out`.

The error in the previous solution was due to incorrect calculation of the height of the shell. We must follow the rule that the shell grows in the sequence RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, TOP. With each complete sequence, the height and width increase correctly to form the shell of order `N`.

Let's correct the `compute_shell_dimensions` function as follows:

```python
def compute_shell_dimensions(N):
    # The shell height is simply N + (N - 1), because it grows by one layer at the top and one at the bottom for each new value of N
    height = N + (N - 1)
    # The shell width is N + (N - 2), because the first layer is just a single block, and it grows by one layer on the right for each new value of N except the first
    width = N + (N - 2)
    return (height, width)

def compute_line_elements(N, P):
    height, width = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    
    # The outermost layer always has value N. We find the value for the Pth line by subtracting the count of layers above it.
    # Each layer decreases the value by 1 until we reach the middle layers which keep the value 1.
    # We determine the layer by counting how many times we can subtract 2 from P (top and bottom layers) before reaching the middle.
    layer_value = N - (P - 1) // 2
    line_elements = [max(layer_value, 1)] * width  # The middle layer(s) always have value 1
    
    return line_elements

# Read input from file
with open('cochilie.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
        result = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    elif C == 2:
        N, P = map(int, lines[1].strip().split())
        result = compute_line_elements(N, P)

# Write output to file
with open('cochilie.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly calculate both the dimensions of the shell and the elements of a specific line `P` with optimized memory usage and write the correct output to `cochilie.out`.

The previous solutions had incorrect calculations for determining the dimensions of the cochilie (shell). Let's carefully rethink the calculation:

The height of the cochilie of order `N` increases by 2 for each full sequence (RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, TOP), starting with a single element for `N=1`. With each full sequence, the width increases by 1. Therefore, if `N=5`, we have 4 full sequences after the initial element, which adds 4*2 to the height and 4 to the width, giving us a height of 1 + 4*2 = 9 and width of 1 + 4 = 5. However, since the last sequence of LEFT, TOP is not complete (it's missing the TOP addition), we should subtract 1 from the height. So, the height should be 8 instead of 9, which is `1 + 2*(N-1) - 1`.

I will now fix the `compute_shell_dimensions` function to take into account the incomplete final sequence:

```python
def compute_shell_dimensions(N):
    # The height increases by 2 for each full sequence after the first element, but subtract 1 for the incomplete sequence.
    height = 1 + 2 * (N - 1) - 1
    # The width increases by 1 for each value of N after the first element.
    width = 1 + (N - 1)
    return (height, width)

# The compute_line_elements function remains unchanged, as it's only used when C equals 2.
# For consistency, the same function is left in place, although the input for this example only requires the dimensions.

# Read input from file
with open('cochilie.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
        result = compute_shell_dimensions(N)
    elif C == 2:
        N, P = map(int, lines[1].strip().split())
        result = compute_line_elements(N, P)

# Write output to file
with open('cochilie.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f'{result[0]} {result[1]}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the dimensions of the cochilie and produce the expected output in `cochilie.out`.
