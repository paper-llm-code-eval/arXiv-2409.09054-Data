În timpul acţiunii ”Furtuna în deşert” din cauza unei furtuni de nisip, $n$ soldaţi s-au rătăcit de plutoanele lor. După trecerea furtunii se pune problema regrupării acestora pe plutoane. Pentru aceasta se folosesc plăcuţele de identificare pe care soldaţii le poartă la gât. Pe aceste plăcuţe sunt scrise numere care pot identifica fiecare soldat şi plutonul din care acesta face parte. Astfel, soldaţii din acelaşi pluton au numărul de identificare format din aceleaşi cifre, dispuse în altă ordine şi numerele de identificare sunt unice. De exemplu, numerele de identificare $78003433$, $83043073$, $33347008$ indică faptul că cei trei soldaţi care le poartă fac parte din acelaşi pluton.

# Cerinţă
Fiind date cele $n$ numere de pe plăcuţele de identificare, să se regrupeze cei $n$ soldaţi pe plutoane, indicându-se numărul de plutoane găsite (un pluton refăcut trebuie să aibă minimum un soldat), numărul de soldaţi din cel mai numeros pluton, numărul de plutoane care au acest număr maxim de soldaţi precum şi componenţa unui astfel de pluton (cu număr maxim de soldaţi regrupaţi).

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `pluton.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul $n$ de soldaţi recuperaţi, iar pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii câte un număr de identificare a celor $n$ soldaţi.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `pluton.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul de plutoane refăcute.
Linia a doua va conţine numărul de soldaţi din cel mai numeros pluton refăcut.
Linia a treia va conţine numărul de plutoane care au numărul maxim de soldaţi recuperaţi.
Linia a patra va conţine componenţa unui astfel de pluton, cu număr maxim de soldaţi recuperaţi, numerele de identificare ale soldaţilor din componenţă fiind scrise unul după altul separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $0 < n \leq 4\ 000$
- $0 <$ număr de identificare $< 2\ 000\ 000\ 000$
- Deoarece linia a patra conţine numerele de identificare ale soldaţilor **unuia** dintre plutoanele cu un număr maxim de soldaţi, pot exista mai multe soluţii corecte. Se poate alege oricare dintre acestea.
- Se acordă punctaje parţiale astfel: pentru valoarea corectă de pe prima linie se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj; pentru valorile corecte de pe prima şi a doua linie se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj, pentru valorile corecte de pe prima, a doua şi a treia linie se acordă $70\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a tuturor cerinţelor se acordă punctajul integral aferent testului.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input data
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Function to get the key for a soldier's identification number (sorted digits)

# Group soldiers into platoons based on their identification numbers
platoons = defaultdict(list)
for soldier_id in soldiers:
    key = get_key(soldier_id)
    platoons[key].append(soldier_id)

# Find the platoon(s) with the maximum number of soldiers
max_soldiers = 0
max_platoons_count = 0
max_platoons = []

for key, platoon in platoons.items():
    if len(platoon) > max_soldiers:
        max_soldiers = len(platoon)
        max_platoons_count = 1
        max_platoons = [platoon]
    elif len(platoon) == max_soldiers:
        max_platoons_count += 1
        max_platoons.append(platoon)

largest_platoon = max_platoons[0]

# Write output data
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(len(platoons)) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_soldiers) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_platoons_count) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(largest_platoon) + '\n')
```

This Python solution reads from `pluton.in` and writes to `pluton.out` as required. It does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations, and instead uses file operations. It uses a dictionary to group soldiers into platoons which allows efficient lookups and insertions. It keeps track of platoons with the maximum number of soldiers to meet the given requirements, and uses no unnecessary memory. The memory usage should remain within the limits, as only necessary data is stored and processed.

The error you received indicates that the `numpy` library is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since our program did not use `numpy` at all, we can simply remove the unnecessary import statement.

Here is the revised solution without importing `numpy`:

```python
# Import necessary library
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to get the key for a soldier's identification number (sorted digits)
def get_key(num):
    return ''.join(sorted(num))

# Read input data
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Group soldiers into platoons based on their identification numbers
platoons = defaultdict(list)
for soldier_id in soldiers:
    key = get_key(soldier_id)
    platoons[key].append(soldier_id)

# Find the platoon(s) with the maximum number of soldiers
max_soldiers = 0
max_platoons_count = 0
max_platoons = []

for key, platoon in platoons.items():
    if len(platoon) > max_soldiers:
        max_soldiers = len(platoon)
        max_platoons_count = 1
        max_platoons = [platoon]
    elif len(platoon) == max_soldiers:
        max_platoons_count += 1
        max_platoons.append(platoon)

largest_platoon = max_platoons[0]

# Write output data
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(len(platoons)) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_soldiers) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_platoons_count) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(largest_platoon) + '\n')
```

In this corrected script, I removed the import statement for `numpy` since we didn't use it in our solution. The rest of the code remains the same, focusing on memory-efficient operations and utilizing a default dictionary to group the soldiers into platoons by their sorted identification numbers. The output is written to `pluton.out` as per the problem's requirement.

The results differ because the expected output is looking for the platoon with the largest number of soldiers, but when there are multiple platoons with the same maximum size, it appears to have a preference for the platoon that contains the smallest numerical values when the identification numbers are in their original, unsorted form. 

My initial solution simply took the first platoon encountered with the maximum number of soldiers without considering their original numerical values. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that when we encounter platoons with the same size, we select the one that has the smallest numerical value when its soldier IDs are in the original form.

Here's the rewritten solution that takes this into account:

```python
# Import necessary library
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input data
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Function to get the key for a soldier's identification number (sorted digits)
def get_key(num):
    return ''.join(sorted(num))

# Group soldiers into platoons based on their identification numbers
platoons = defaultdict(list)
for soldier_id in soldiers:
    key = get_key(soldier_id)
    platoons[key].append(soldier_id)

# Find the platoon(s) with the maximum number of soldiers
max_soldiers = 0
max_platoons_count = 0
max_platoons = defaultdict(list)

for key, platoon in platoons.items():
    platoon_size = len(platoon)
    if platoon_size > max_soldiers:
        max_soldiers = platoon_size
        max_platoons_count = 1
        max_platoons = defaultdict(list)
        max_platoons[platoon_size] = platoon
    elif platoon_size == max_soldiers:
        max_platoons_count += 1
        max_platoons[platoon_size].extend(platoon)

# Sort the platoons by their original numerical values
sorted_max_platoons = sorted(max_platoons[max_soldiers], key=lambda x: int(x))

# Write output data
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(len(platoons)) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_soldiers) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_platoons_count) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(sorted_max_platoons) + '\n')
```

This solution now takes care to select the platoon with the smallest numerical values if there are multiple platoons with the same maximum size. It sorts the soldiers in the largest platoon(s) by their original numerical values before writing the output.

The difference in the expected output and the found output is that the expected output wants a single platoon displayed which is one of the platoons with the maximum number of soldiers. My previous solution incorrectly included all soldiers from all platoons with the maximum size, which is why we see six numbers instead of three.

To fix this, we need to first determine the largest platoons correctly and then output just one of those platoons, not all soldiers from all platoons with the maximum size. Additionally, we need to sort the platoons based on the lexicographical order of their original numbers (interpreted as strings) to be consistent with the example provided.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Import necessary library
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input data
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Function to get the key for a soldier's identification number (sorted digits)
def get_key(num):
    return ''.join(sorted(num))

# Group soldiers into platoons based on their identification numbers
platoons = defaultdict(list)
for soldier_id in soldiers:
    key = get_key(soldier_id)
    platoons[key].append(soldier_id)

# Find the platoon(s) with the maximum number of soldiers
max_soldiers = 0
max_platoons = []

for key, platoon in platoons.items():
    platoon_size = len(platoon)
    if platoon_size > max_soldiers:
        max_soldiers = platoon_size
        max_platoons = [platoon]
    elif platoon_size == max_soldiers:
        max_platoons.append(platoon)

# Sort the platoons by the lexicographical order of their original numbers
max_platoons.sort(key=lambda p: [int(s) for s in p])

# Select one of the largest platoons to output
largest_platoon = min(max_platoons, key=lambda p: [int(s) for s in p])

# Write output data
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(len(platoons)) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_soldiers) + '\n')
    file.write(str(len(max_platoons)) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(largest_platoon) + '\n')
```
This solution finds the correct largest platoons, sorts them correctly, and then chooses the lexicographically smallest platoon to output. This should match the expected output format.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output lies in the sorting of the platoon members. The expected output requires that within a platoon with the maximum number of soldiers, the soldier identification numbers should be listed in ascending order. However, the found output lists them in lexicographical order instead, which is why we see "123 321 312" instead of "321 312 123".

To fix this, we need to sort the identification numbers within the selected platoon in ascending numerical order before writing them to the output file. Let's rewrite the solution with this fix:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to get the key for a soldier's identification number (sorted digits)
def get_key(num):
    return ''.join(sorted(num))

# Read input data
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldiers = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Group soldiers into platoons based on their identification numbers
platoons = defaultdict(list)
for soldier_id in soldiers:
    key = get_key(soldier_id)
    platoons[key].append(soldier_id)

# Find the largest platoons
max_soldiers = 0
largest_platoon = []
max_platoons_count = 0
for platoon in platoons.values():
    if len(platoon) > max_soldiers:
        max_soldiers = len(platoon)
        largest_platoon = platoon
        max_platoons_count = 1
    elif len(platoon) == max_soldiers:
        max_platoons_count += 1
        # Compare the lexicographical order of the platoon numbers
        if ''.join(sorted(platoon)) < ''.join(sorted(largest_platoon)):
            largest_platoon = platoon

# Sort the largest platoon in ascending order by their original numbers
largest_platoon.sort(key=int)

# Write output data
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(len(platoons)) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_soldiers) + '\n')
    file.write(str(max_platoons_count) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(largest_platoon) + '\n')
```
In this corrected solution, we sort the platoon members numerically before writing the output. We also ensure that among the platoons with the maximum number of soldiers, the one chosen is the one with the smallest lexicographical order when their numbers are combined as strings. This should provide the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output arises from a mistake in the selection of the largest platoon. The expected output lists a single platoon with soldiers whose identification numbers are sorted in ascending numerical order. However, my previous solution provided identification numbers that are sorted lexicographically based on the key generated for grouping, not by their original numerical values.

The primary issue with my previous solution is that it incorrectly sorts the platoon with the maximum number of soldiers by the sorted key, not by the original numerical values of the soldiers' identification numbers. We must ensure that we sort and output a single platoon based on the original numerical values of the identification numbers.

Here's the rewritten solution that corrects this issue:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input data
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldier_ids = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Function to get the key for a soldier's identification number (sorted digits)
def get_key(num):
    return ''.join(sorted(num))

# Group soldiers into platoons based on their identification numbers
platoons = defaultdict(list)
for soldier_id in soldier_ids:
    platoons[get_key(soldier_id)].append(soldier_id)

# Analyze the platoons to find the largest
platoon_sizes = defaultdict(int)
for platoon in platoons.values():
    platoon_sizes[len(platoon)] += 1

max_size = max(platoon_sizes.keys())
max_platoons_count = platoon_sizes[max_size]

# Select the platoon(s) with the largest size and sort them numerically
max_platoons = [sorted(platoon, key=int) for platoon in platoons.values() if len(platoon) == max_size]

# Choose the platoon with the numerically smallest starting soldier
smallest_platoon = min(max_platoons, key=lambda x: int(x[0]))

# Write output data
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(platoons)}\n")
    file.write(f"{max_size}\n")
    file.write(f"{max_platoons_count}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(smallest_platoon) + '\n')
```

This revised solution should now correctly identify the largest platoons, count how many of them there are, and select one that has the numerically smallest identification number for the first soldier. It then writes the soldiers' IDs from this platoon in numerical ascending order.

My apologies for the oversight. The issue is that the comparison to find the smallest platoon based on the numerically smallest starting soldier ID does not ensure the correct result. The expected output may not be based on the first soldier's ID only; it might be based on the entire set of IDs within a platoon. Thus, we must compare the entire set of soldier IDs as a sequence when determining the smallest platoon.

We need to sort each platoon by numerical order first, and then compare platoons based on these sorted lists to choose the correct platoon for the output. Here's a corrected version of the algorithm that ensures this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input data
with open('pluton.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    soldier_ids = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Function to get the key for a soldier's identification number (sorted digits)
def get_key(num):
    return ''.join(sorted(str(num)))

# Group soldiers into platoons based on their identification numbers
platoons = defaultdict(list)
for soldier_id in soldier_ids:
    platoons[get_key(soldier_id)].append(soldier_id)

# Find the largest platoon(s)
max_soldier_count = 0
max_platoons = []
for platoon in platoons.values():
    if len(platoon) > max_soldier_count:
        max_soldier_count = len(platoon)
        max_platoons = [platoon]
    elif len(platoon) == max_soldier_count:
        max_platoons.append(platoon)

# Sort platoons based on sorted order of soldier IDs
max_platoons = [' '.join(map(str, sorted(platoon))) for platoon in max_platoons]

# Choose the smallest platoon based on the sorted string representation
smallest_platoon = min(max_platoons, key=lambda x: [int(id) for id in x.split()])

# Write output data
with open('pluton.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(platoons)}\n")
    file.write(f"{max_soldier_count}\n")
    file.write(f"{len(max_platoons)}\n")
    file.write(smallest_platoon + '\n')
```

This code first groups soldiers into platoons, then finds those with the maximum number of soldiers. After that, it sorts the IDs within each max-sized platoon. Finally, it compares these sorted lists to find the smallest platoon (lexicographically smallest when considering the entire list of soldier IDs) and writes the sorted list of IDs for that platoon to the output file. This should align with the expected output.
