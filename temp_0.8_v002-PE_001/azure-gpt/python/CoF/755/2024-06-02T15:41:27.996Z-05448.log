Marele vrăjitor Prospero are o grădină minunată îngrijită de o sumedenie de spiriduși care n-au altă sarcină decât să zboare la orele dimineții de-a lungul aleilor și să stropească plantele din vasele ornamentale de piatră aflate pe margine. Există un havuz chiar la capătul grădinii și o alee principală ce pornește de la havuz și duce până la intrare. Din aleea principală se desprind alei secundare ce formează ronduri alungite revenind, în același loc, la aleea principală.

Se știe că există $n$ spiriduși, numerotați de la $1$ la $n$, fiecare pentru câte una dintre aleile secundare. Toți pornesc de la havuz la ora $5:00:00$ dimineața cu câte un vas cu apă pregătit de cu seară, străbat aleea principală până la rondul lor, apoi parcurg aleea rondului propriu, revin în aleea principală, se întorc la havuz pentru a se alimenta cu apă și o iau de la capăt la fel, până la ora $9:00:00$ când se retrag la umbră pentru somn. Se știe că toți spiridușii zboară fără încetare, cu aceeași viteză, pe toată durata celor exact $4$ ore. Se cunosc, pentru fiecare spiriduș, numărul de secunde necesare pentru a ajunge de la havuz la rondul propriu și numărul de secunde necesare pentru a parcurge în întregime rondul propriu. Orice spiriduș care ajunge la havuz își umple vasul în exact o secundă, de la un robinet aflat pe marginea havuzului. De exemplu, dacă spiridușul care se ocupă de rondul $5$ din figură are nevoie de $2$ secunde pentru a ajunge la rondul său și de $15$ secunde pentru a parcurge rondul $5$, atunci va reveni la havuz pentru a-și umple vasul la orele $5:00:19$ ($2 + 15 + 2$), își umple vasul și pornește iar la ora $5:00:20$, revine iar la $5:00:39$ și pleacă iar la ora $5:00:40$ etc.

Doi spiriduși nu își pot umple vasul în același moment de la același robinet.

~[elfi.png]

# Cerință

Se cere să se determine numărul minim de robinete cu care trebuie să fie prevăzut havuzul astfel încât nici un spiriduş, în nici un moment, să nu fie nevoit să aştepte pentru a-şi putea umple vasul cu apă.

# Date de intrare

Din fișierul de intrare `elfi.in` se citesc:

* $n$, numărul de spiriduși, de pe primul rând;
* $n$ perechi de forma $c_i \ p_i$ reprezentând numărul de secunde de la havuz la rondul propriu și respectiv numărul de secunde necesar pentru parcurgerea rondului propriu, de pe următoarele $n$ linii ale fișierului.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `elfi.out` se scrie o singura linie cu un singur număr reprezentând numărul minim de robinete necesare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 5 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100$;
* $1 \leq p_i \leq 100$;

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Define a function to calculate the required number of taps
def calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time):
    # Initialize an array to keep track of all timestamps when elves reach the fountain
    timestamps = np.zeros(total_time, dtype=int)
    
    # Fill the timestamps array with visit times of each elf
    for time_to_round, round_time in elf_data:
        total_cycle_time = 2 * time_to_round + round_time + 1
        for time_stamp in range(time_to_round, total_time, total_cycle_time):
            timestamps[time_stamp] += 1
    
    # The number of taps is equal to the maximum number of elves at the fountain at the same time
    return np.max(timestamps)

# Read the input data
with open('elfi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # Number of elves
    elf_data = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the total time in seconds (4 hours)
total_time = 4 * 60 * 60

# Calculate the required number of taps
num_taps = calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time)

# Write the output data
with open('elfi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_taps) + '\n')
```

This solution reads the input data from a file `elfi.in`, calculates the minimum number of taps needed so no elf has to wait using numpy to optimize the operations on the array, and then writes the result to a file `elfi.out`. The solution is designed to be sensitive to memory usage by using a numpy array of integers for the timestamps and calculating the maximum number of elves at the fountain at the same time in an efficient manner.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since the challenge requires optimizing both time and memory usage, and explicitly suggests utilizing `numpy`, we might want to reconsider this constraint given the error message. However, since the problem has a memory limit of ~8MB and `numpy` is a relatively large library, it is possible that this is a deliberate constraint to test the ability to write efficient code without relying on external libraries.

Given these constraints, we will need to rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other external libraries. We can use Python's built-in data structures and algorithms to minimize memory usage and optimize for speed.

Here is the revised solution using only built-in Python functionality:

```python
# Define a function to calculate the required number of taps
def calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time):
    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of all timestamps when elves reach the fountain
    timestamps = {}

    # Fill the timestamps dictionary with visit times of each elf
    for time_to_round, round_time in elf_data:
        total_cycle_time = 2 * time_to_round + round_time + 1
        for time_stamp in range(time_to_round, total_time, total_cycle_time):
            if time_stamp not in timestamps:
                timestamps[time_stamp] = 1
            else:
                timestamps[time_stamp] += 1

    # The number of taps is equal to the maximum number of elves at the fountain at the same time
    return max(timestamps.values(), default=0)

# Read the input data
with open('elfi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # Number of elves
    elf_data = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the total time in seconds (4 hours)
total_time = 4 * 60 * 60

# Calculate the required number of taps
num_taps = calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time)

# Write the output data
with open('elfi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_taps) + '\n')
```

This solution should work within the memory constraint and without relying on external libraries. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the timestamps when elves will be at the fountain and iterates over the dictionary to find the maximum number of elves that will be at the fountain at the same time. This will give us the number of taps required. The 'default=0' argument in the 'max' function ensures that if the 'timestamps' dictionary is empty, it will return 0 instead of raising a ValueError.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result suggests that the current implementation of calculating the maximum number of taps required may have a flaw. In particular, it seems that the algorithm might not be correctly accounting for the fact that after filling the water, the elf takes an additional second to start the next round. This means that the next round actually starts one second after filling the water, and this one-second delay could create a scenario where more taps are needed than the algorithm is calculating.

To address this, we need to adjust the algorithm to correctly consider the time each elf spends at the fountain, including the one second it takes to fill the water and the additional second before starting the next round.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Define a function to calculate the required number of taps
def calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time):
    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of all timestamps when elves reach the fountain
    timestamps = {}

    # Fill the timestamps dictionary with visit times of each elf
    for time_to_round, round_time in elf_data:
        total_cycle_time = 2 * time_to_round + round_time + 1
        for time_stamp in range(time_to_round, total_time, total_cycle_time):
            # Increment the counters for both arriving at and leaving the fountain
            timestamps[time_stamp] = timestamps.get(time_stamp, 0) + 1
            timestamps[time_stamp + 1] = timestamps.get(time_stamp + 1, 0) - 1

    # Keep a running sum to find the maximum number of taps needed at any time
    running_sum = 0
    max_taps = 0
    for time_stamp in sorted(timestamps):
        running_sum += timestamps[time_stamp]
        if running_sum > max_taps:
            max_taps = running_sum

    return max_taps

# Read the input data
with open('elfi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # Number of elves
    elf_data = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the total time in seconds (4 hours)
total_time = 4 * 60 * 60

# Calculate the required number of taps
num_taps = calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time)

# Write the output data
with open('elfi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_taps) + '\n')
```

In this updated solution, we track both the arrival and departure of each elf at the fountain with two separate entries in the dictionary, one marking the increase in elves when they arrive and filling their water, and one marking the decrease when they leave one second later. Then we calculate the running sum of elves at the fountain at each second using a sorted sequence of timestamps, which gives us the maximum number of concurrent elves—and thus the number of taps needed. This should provide the correct number of taps required.

The issue with the previous solution is that it wasn't correctly handling the time when elves are at the fountain. Each elf needs 1 second to fill the vase, and we have to account for the time they spend at the fountain, as well as the possibility that multiple elves might arrive at the fountain at the same second.

To correct this, we need to simulate the entire process second by second, taking into account the time each elf spends at the fountain. Instead of a dictionary, we can use a list to keep track of which second each elf will be at the fountain, incrementing for their presence at the fountain and then decrementing when they leave. This way, we can find the maximum number of elves at the fountain at any given second, which is equal to the minimum number of taps needed.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('elfi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # Number of elves
    elf_data = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the total time in seconds (4 hours)
total_time = 4 * 60 * 60

# Initialize a list to keep track of all timestamps when elves are at the fountain
# We add 1 to total_time because an elf could be at the fountain at the last second
timestamps = [0] * (total_time + 1)

# Fill the timestamps list with visit times of each elf
for time_to_round, round_time in elf_data:
    # Calculate the total cycle time for each elf
    # +1 for filling the vase, +1 for the second after filling the vase before leaving
    total_cycle_time = 2 * time_to_round + round_time + 1
    for time_stamp in range(time_to_round, total_time, total_cycle_time):
        # Increment the counter for arriving at the fountain
        timestamps[time_stamp] += 1
        # Decrement the counter for leaving the fountain one second later
        if time_stamp + 1 <= total_time:
            timestamps[time_stamp + 1] -= 1

# The number of taps is equal to the maximum number of elves at the fountain at the same time
running_sum = 0
max_taps = 0
for count in timestamps:
    running_sum += count
    if running_sum > max_taps:
        max_taps = running_sum

# Write the output data
with open('elfi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_taps) + '\n')
```

In this implementation, we are using a list called `timestamps` to track the number of elves at the fountain at every second. We increment the count at the time they arrive, and decrement it one second after they arrive, which accounts for the time they are at the fountain. Then, we use a running sum to find the maximum number of elves at the fountain at any second, which gives us the number of taps needed. This should now correctly calculate the required number of taps and match the expected output.

Upon reviewing the problem statement and the solution logic, we notice that the issue is due to the second-by-second simulation not being correctly implemented. Specifically, the previous solution does not account for the fact that elves may arrive at the fountain at the same time, and if the fountain is already occupied, they have to wait.

To correctly handle this scenario, we must simulate the process by considering that an elf may have to wait if the fountain is occupied when they arrive. We need an event-based simulation where we track the arrival times of all elves at the fountain, sort these times, and then determine the minimum number of taps needed to ensure no elf has to wait.

Let's implement this solution:

```python
# Define a function to calculate the required number of taps
def calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time):
    # Generate all arrival times at the fountain for each elf
    arrival_times = []
    for time_to_round, round_time in elf_data:
        time = time_to_round
        while time < total_time:
            arrival_times.append(time)
            # Update time for the next cycle
            time += 2 * time_to_round + round_time + 1

    # Sort the arrival times
    arrival_times.sort()

    # Determine the number of taps required
    num_taps = 0
    current_taps = 0
    last_time = -1
    for arrival_time in arrival_times:
        if arrival_time != last_time:
            current_taps = 1
        else:
            current_taps += 1
        if current_taps > num_taps:
            num_taps = current_taps
        last_time = arrival_time

    return num_taps

# Read the input data
with open('elfi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # Number of elves
    elf_data = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the total time in seconds (4 hours)
total_time = 4 * 60 * 60

# Calculate the required number of taps
num_taps = calculate_taps(elf_data, total_time)

# Write the output data
with open('elfi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_taps) + '\n')
```

This solution calculates the arrival times for all elves at the fountain after completing their rounds. It then sorts these times and iterates through them, tracking the number of elves arriving at the same time (which is the same as the number of taps needed at that moment). We update the maximum number of taps needed whenever we encounter more simultaneous arrivals than previously recorded. This solution should now correctly produce the expected output.

It seems the previous implementation still did not properly handle the possibility that multiple elves could arrive at the same time and require an available tap. To fix this, we need to simulate the arrivals and departures in a way that tracks the maximum number of taps required at any given time over the period the elves are working.

One way to solve this is to create a list of events, where each event either represents an elf arriving at or leaving the fountain. We can then iterate over the sorted events, incrementing the count of needed taps when an elf arrives and decrementing when an elf leaves. The highest count during this iteration is the number of taps we need.

Let's implement this revised solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('elfi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())  # Number of elves
    elf_data = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize a list to keep track of all events (arrivals and departures)
events = []

# Calculate the events for each elf
for time_to_round, round_time in elf_data:
    start_time = time_to_round
    while start_time < 4 * 60 * 60:  # Duration of 4 hours in seconds
        # Each elf takes 1 second to fill the vase, so we mark the arrival
        # and departure (arrival + 1 second) times
        events.append((start_time, 'arrival'))
        events.append((start_time + 1, 'departure'))
        # Calculate the next start time
        start_time += time_to_round + round_time + 1 + time_to_round

# Sort events based on time
events.sort()

# Count the number of taps needed
max_taps = 0
current_taps = 0
for event in events:
    if event[1] == 'arrival':
        current_taps += 1
    else:  # event[1] == 'departure'
        current_taps -= 1
    max_taps = max(max_taps, current_taps)

# Write the output data
with open('elfi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_taps) + '\n')
```

In this implementation, the events list contains tuples where the first element is the time of the event and the second element is the type of event (either 'arrival' or 'departure'). By sorting the events by time and then iterating through them, we maintain a count of how many taps are in use at any moment. The peak number of taps in use is the answer we are looking for.

This implementation should correctly calculate the minimum number of taps required for the given input and satisfy the constraints and requirements of the challenge.
