După ce a primit de la Simonet, profesorul său de studii sociale, tema pentru proiect, tânărului Trevor i-a venit ideea jocului ”Pay it forward”. Pentru cei care nu știu acest joc, el constă în ajutarea de către Trevor a oamenilor aflați la ananghie. Aceștia la rândul lor vor ajuta alți oameni și așa mai departe.

Fiecare participant (inclusiv Trevor) trebuie să realizeze câte $k$ fapte bune prin care să ajute oamenii. Vârstnicii și tinerii își îndeplinesc în mod diferit această sarcină. Vârstnicii au nevoie de $\text{zv}$ zile pentru a introduce în joc o altă persoană, iar tinerii au nevoie de $\text{zt}$ zile. Astfel dacă un vârstnic, respectiv un tânăr, intră în joc în ziua $i$, el va introduce la rândul lui în joc prima persoană în ziua $i+\text{zv}$, respectiv în ziua $i+\text{zt}$ tânărul, a doua persoană în ziua $i+2*\text{zv}$, respectiv în ziua $i+2*\text{zt}$ tânărul și așa mai departe. Astfel numărul de persoane care participă la joc poate fi diferit în funcție de cum sunt alese persoanele vârstnice și cele tinere. Trevor dorește ca în joc să fie realizate în total cât mai multe fapte bune, dar fiecare participant să aducă în joc maximum $(k+1)/2$ tineri și maximum $(k+1)/2$ vârstnici. Participanții pot aduce mai puține persoane de un anumit tip, dar nu au voie să depășească numărul de $(k+1)/2$ persoane de același tip.

# Cerință

Care este numărul $\text{fb}$ de fapte bune care mai sunt de realizat, după trecerea a $n$ zile, de către persoanele intrate deja în joc, astfel încât numărul total de fapte bune așteptate (și cele realizate și cele nerealizate) să fie maxim?

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `pif.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $n$, pe a doua linie numărul $k$ și pe a treia linie numerele $\text{zv}$ și $\text{zt}$ separate printr-un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `pif.out` se va scrie restul împărțirii lui $\text{fb}$, cu semnificația din enunț, la $1234567$ ($\text{fb} % 1234567$).

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$;
* $1 \leq k, \text{zt}, \text{zv} \leq n$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $30$ de puncte $\text{fb} \leq 10^6$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $30$ de puncte $\text{zv} = \text{zt} = 1$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $20$ de puncte $\text{zv} = \text{zt} \neq 1$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $70$ de puncte $k \cdot n \leq 10^6$;

It seems that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the code is being run. Since there is a memory constraint and `numpy` cannot be used, I'll rewrite the solution without `numpy` and using only built-in Python data structures to minimize memory usage.

Below is the complete solution with the necessary adjustments:

```python
# Constants
MOD = 1234567

def calculate_remaining_good_deeds(n, k, zv, zt):
    # Initialize the number of good deeds done by both the old and the young
    deeds_old = [0] * (n + 1)
    deeds_young = [0] * (n + 1)
    max_participants = (k + 1) // 2

    # Trevor does k good deeds starting from day 0
    deeds_old[0] = k

    # Calculate the good deeds done each day
    for day in range(1, n + 1):
        # Number of old and young people that can potentially join today
        can_join_old = day // zv if day >= zv else 0
        can_join_young = day // zt if day >= zt else 0

        # Restrict the number based on the max participants allowed
        can_join_old = min(can_join_old, max_participants)
        can_join_young = min(can_join_young, max_participants)

        # Update the deeds for the current day based on the participants who can join
        deeds_old[day] += (deeds_old[day - zv] if day >= zv else 0) * can_join_old
        deeds_young[day] += (deeds_young[day - zt] if day >= zt else 0) * can_join_young

        # Modulo operation to ensure memory usage is within the limit
        deeds_old[day] %= MOD
        deeds_young[day] %= MOD

    # Sum up the good deeds yet to be done
    total_deeds_old = sum(deeds_old) % MOD
    total_deeds_young = sum(deeds_young) % MOD

    # Calculate and return the remaining good deeds
    remaining_good_deeds = (total_deeds_old + total_deeds_young) * (k - day % k) % MOD
    return remaining_good_deeds

# Read input from file
with open('pif.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    zv, zt = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate the number of remaining good deeds
fb = calculate_remaining_good_deeds(n, k, zv, zt)

# Write the result to file
with open('pif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(fb))

This version of the solution does not rely on external libraries and should keep the memory usage within the specified limit.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it's clear that the logic for calculating the remaining good deeds is incorrect. The previous solution incorrectly calculated the number of old and young people joining each day and did not account for the spreading effect of the 'pay it forward' mechanism properly.

Let's correct the logic. We need to accurately simulate the process of paying it forward over the days, taking into account the number of good deeds done by both old and young participants for each day.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1234567

def pay_it_forward(n, k, zv, zt):
    # Initialize participants for old and young and their good deeds
    participants_old = [0] * (n + 1)
    participants_young = [0] * (n + 1)
    good_deeds = 0
    
    # Trevor starts the chain
    participants_old[0] = 1
    
    # Loop over each day
    for day in range(n + 1):
        # Update the good deeds for the current day
        good_deeds = (good_deeds + (participants_old[day] + participants_young[day]) * k) % MOD

        # Determine how many new participants can join today
        if day + zv <= n and participants_old[day] > 0:
            # Old participants can pay it forward every zv days
            participants_old[day + zv] += participants_old[day] // 2
            participants_young[day + zv] += participants_old[day] // 2
        if day + zt <= n and participants_young[day] > 0:
            # Young participants can pay it forward every zt days
            participants_young[day + zt] += participants_young[day] // 2
            participants_old[day + zt] += participants_young[day] // 2

    return good_deeds

# Read input from file
with open('pif.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    zv, zt = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate the number of remaining good deeds
fb = pay_it_forward(n, k, zv, zt)

# Write the result to file
with open('pif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(fb))
```

This solution maintains two lists to keep track of the number of old and young participants for each day. It updates the number of good deeds as well as the participants who will join in the future, based on the days required for each type of participant to pay it forward. This should now produce the correct output and satisfy the memory constraints.

Upon reviewing the issue, it's apparent that there is a misunderstanding in the logic used to track the participants who are paying it forward. The model needs to accurately simulate how participants, both old and young, are recruited over time and how many good deeds they are expected to perform. The previous solution does not correctly simulate the chain reaction of the "pay it forward" process, particularly how new participants are introduced to the game by existing ones.

Let's correct the algorithm with a new approach. We will maintain a list of participants who will be able to perform good deeds on each day and ensure that each participant only recruits up to `(k + 1) / 2` old and `(k + 1) / 2` young participants. We will then calculate the number of good deeds remaining after `n` days.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1234567

def pay_it_forward(n, k, zv, zt):
    # Initialize the number of good deeds to be performed each day by new participants
    good_deeds = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Trevor starts the game and performs k good deeds
    good_deeds[0] = k
    
    # Each participant can bring in at most half of k (rounded up) young and old participants
    max_recruits = (k + 1) // 2
    
    # Count of old and young participants introduced each day
    old_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    young_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Trevor is the first participant
    old_count[0] = 1
    
    # Simulate each day
    for day in range(n):
        # Recruit and perform good deeds based on the number of old participants
        if day + zv <= n and old_count[day] > 0:
            recruits = min(old_count[day], max_recruits)
            old_count[day + zv] += recruits
            good_deeds[day + zv] += recruits * k
            
        # Recruit and perform good deeds based on the number of young participants
        if day + zt <= n and young_count[day] > 0:
            recruits = min(young_count[day], max_recruits)
            young_count[day + zt] += recruits
            good_deeds[day + zt] += recruits * k

        # Spread the good deeds from those who were brought in by old and young participants
        if day + zv <= n:
            young_count[day + zv] += old_count[day] - recruits
        if day + zt <= n:
            old_count[day + zt] += young_count[day] - recruits

    # Calculate the total good deeds remaining after n days
    total_good_deeds = sum(good_deeds) % MOD
    return total_good_deeds

# Read input from file
with open('pif.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    zv, zt = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate the number of remaining good deeds
fb = pay_it_forward(n, k, zv, zt)

# Write the result to file
with open('pif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(fb))
```

This solution should now accurately track the number of good deeds performed by new participants, considering the limitations on the number of recruits and the days it takes to recruit them. It should calculate the correct number of good deeds remaining after `n` days.

It seems there's a mistake in the previous implementations, primarily around how participants are added to the game and how the good deeds they will perform are counted. The correct approach should calculate the number of new participants added by both the old and young on each day and then determine the number of good deeds these participants are expected to perform within the `n` days.

To implement this logic, we need to keep track of how many old and young participants are added to the game each day and then for each day, calculate the number of good deeds that are expected to be performed by the participants on that day and in the future, without exceeding the memory constraints.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1234567

def calculate_good_deeds(n, k, zv, zt):
    # Participants array (old, young)
    participants = [[1, 0]]  # Trevor starts as the first old participant

    # Total good deeds counter
    total_good_deeds = k  # Trevor's initial good deeds

    # Calculate the number of participants and good deeds for each day
    for day in range(1, n + 1):
        # Add new participants for today
        participants.append([0, 0])
        
        # Calculate the number of new old participants from previous old and young participants
        if day >= zv:
            for i in range(day - zv, -1, -zv):
                max_old_to_add = (k + 1) // 2 - participants[day][0]
                old_to_add = min(participants[i][0], max_old_to_add)
                participants[day][0] += old_to_add
                if old_to_add == max_old_to_add: break
        
        # Calculate the number of new young participants from previous old participants
        if day >= zt:
            for i in range(day - zt, -1, -zt):
                max_young_to_add = (k + 1) // 2 - participants[day][1]
                young_to_add = min(participants[i][0], max_young_to_add)
                participants[day][1] += young_to_add
                if young_to_add == max_young_to_add: break
        
        # Calculate the good deeds for the day
        good_deeds_today = participants[day][0] * k + participants[day][1] * k
        total_good_deeds = (total_good_deeds + good_deeds_today) % MOD

    # Return the total number of good deeds after n days
    return total_good_deeds

# Read input from file
with open('pif.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    zv, zt = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate the number of good deeds
fb = calculate_good_deeds(n, k, zv, zt)

# Write the result to file
with open('pif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(fb))
```

This implementation should produce the correct output by tracking the number of old and young participants added each day and ensuring that the count of participants and the resulting good deeds do not exceed the limits specified in the problem. It also avoids memory-intensive operations by keeping the size of the participant's list linear with respect to the number of days `n`.

Clearly, my previous solutions did not correctly capture the essence of the "Pay it forward" game and how the number of good deeds is calculated over time. I apologize for the confusion. Let's re-implement the logic correctly.

The main point to consider is that each participant (old or young) can introduce a new participant, who will in turn perform `k` good deeds and also introduce more participants. We have to keep track of the number of participants introduced each day and ensure that they only introduce up to `(k+1)/2` others of each type (old or young).

To compute the total number of good deeds remaining after `n` days, we need to track the number of participants each day who have yet to perform their good deeds (`future_good_deeds`), and subtract it from the maximum possible good deeds that could have been done if all participants completed their good deeds by day `n`.

Let's rewrite the solution with a correct implementation:

```python
MOD = 1234567

def calculate_good_deeds(n, k, zv, zt):
    # Calculate the maximum number of recruits for old and young participants
    max_recruits = (k + 1) // 2
    
    # Initialize good deeds done and future good deeds
    good_deeds_done = 0
    future_good_deeds = 0
    
    # Initialize the queue for each type with Trevor as the first participant
    queue_old = [(0, 1)]  # (day introduced, number of participants)
    queue_young = []
    
    for day in range(n):
        # Add the good deeds done by the already recruited participants
        good_deeds_done += (len(queue_old) + len(queue_young)) * k
        good_deeds_done %= MOD
        
        # Recruit new participants from old ones
        while queue_old and queue_old[0][0] == day:
            _, num_old = queue_old.pop(0)
            num_recruits = min(max_recruits, num_old)
            future_good_deeds += num_recruits * k
            if day + zv < n: queue_old.append((day + zv, num_recruits))
            if day + zt < n: queue_young.append((day + zt, num_recruits))
        
        # Recruit new participants from young ones
        while queue_young and queue_young[0][0] == day:
            _, num_young = queue_young.pop(0)
            num_recruits = min(max_recruits, num_young)
            future_good_deeds += num_recruits * k
            if day + zv < n: queue_old.append((day + zv, num_recruits))
            if day + zt < n: queue_young.append((day + zt, num_recruits))
    
    # Calculate the total possible good deeds if all participants completed their good deeds by day n
    max_good_deeds = (len(queue_old) + len(queue_young)) * k
    max_good_deeds %= MOD
    
    # Calculate the number of good deeds that are yet to be performed after n days
    remaining_good_deeds = (max_good_deeds - good_deeds_done + future_good_deeds) % MOD

    zv, zt = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Calculate the number of remaining good deeds
fb = calculate_good_deeds(n, k, zv, zt)

# Write the result to file
with open('pif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(fb))
```

This should correctly simulate the "Pay it forward" process, taking into account the time it takes for old and young participants to bring new people, and ensuring that each participant only recruits up to `(k+1)/2` others of each type. It tracks both good deeds performed and the future good deeds pledged by participants who have been recruited but have not yet completed their good deeds by day `n`.
