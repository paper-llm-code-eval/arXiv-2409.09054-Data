Vasilică are la grădiniță $N$ turnuri cu înălțimile $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. Când așază în linie niște turnuri, cel puțin două, astfel încât înălțimile lor să fie în ordine crescătoare, Vasilică spune că a construit un deal. Înălțimea dealului este egală cu înălțimea celui mai înalt turn folosit. Iată, de exemplu, că așezând în ordine turnurile cu înălțimile $2 \ 4 \ 4 \ 7 \ 9$ a format un deal cu înălțimea $9$.

Vasilică și-ar dori să așeze în linie cele $N$ turnuri, formând o succesiune de dealuri astfel încât suma înălțimilor dealurilor formate să fie maximă.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri, va determina suma înălțimilor dealurilor ce se pot forma așezând în linie cele $N$ turnuri, maximă posibil.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `deal.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$. Pe cea de a doua linie se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin spații, reprezentând înălțimile celor $N$ turnuri.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `deal.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cerința problemei.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq $ Înălțimile turnurilor $ \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă după aranjarea turnurilor $h_i \leq h_{i+1}$ atunci turnurile $i$ și $i + 1$ fac parte din același deal.

Please copy the entire code block above and ensure it runs within the specific memory and runtime constraints of the challenge. The use of `numpy` helps in handling the tower heights efficiently in memory, and the algorithm is linear in terms of time complexity, iterating through the heights just once.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. If package installation isn't an option or we want to adhere strictly to the memory constraints, it's necessary to rewrite the solution without using `numpy`. 

Let's rewrite the solution in standard Python without external libraries:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills using the tower heights.
def calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights):
    # Initialize the sum of hill heights to zero and the current hill height to zero.
    sum_hill_heights = 0
    current_hill_height = 0

    # Iterate over each tower.
    for height in tower_heights:
        # If the current tower is taller than the current hill height, we start a new hill.
        if height > current_hill_height:
            sum_hill_heights += height
            current_hill_height = height
    
    return sum_hill_heights

# Read the heights from `deal.in`
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read N, the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # Read tower heights into a list

# Calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills.
sum_hill_heights = calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights)

# Write the result to `deal.out`
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(sum_hill_heights))
```

Please copy the entire code block above to ensure it runs within the specific constraints. This solution only uses standard Python libraries, which should work in a typical Python environment.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found output is due to incorrect implementation of the logic for calculating the sum of hill heights. It looks like the function `calculate_sum_of_hills` only starts a new hill when it finds a tower that is taller than the current hill height, but it should also start a new hill when it encounters a tower of the same height as the current hill (since towers with equal heights can be part of the same hill). We need to adjust our code to account for this.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills using the tower heights.
def calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights):
    # Initialize the sum of hill heights to zero and the current hill height to the first tower.
    sum_hill_heights = tower_heights[0]
    current_hill_height = tower_heights[0]

    # Iterate over each tower starting from the second one.
    for height in tower_heights[1:]:
        # If the current tower is taller than or equal to the current hill height, we start a new hill.
        if height >= current_hill_height:
            sum_hill_heights += height
            current_hill_height = height
    
    return sum_hill_heights

# Read the heights from `deal.in`
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read N, the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # Read tower heights into a list

# Calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills.
sum_hill_heights = calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights)

# Write the result to `deal.out`
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(sum_hill_heights))
```

The key change is in the `calculate_sum_of_hills` function, where the condition `if height > current_hill_height` has been changed to `if height >= current_hill_height`. This change ensures that towers of equal height are considered as part of the same hill, and a new hill starts only when a taller tower is encountered.

It seems the previous solution still did not account for the formation of multiple hills. In the given input data, we should form a hill starting with the height of 10, then a new hill starting with the height of 7 (since the towers with height 2 cannot form a hill that contributes to the sum if placed after a taller tower). Hence, the correct sum should include the heights of multiple hills that are formed by consecutive increasing sequences of tower heights.

Let's revisit the logic and fix the code accordingly:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills using the tower heights.
def calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights):
    # Initialize the sum of hill heights to the height of the first tower.
    sum_hill_heights = tower_heights[0]
    # Current hill height starts with the first tower's height.
    current_hill_height = tower_heights[0]

    # Iterate over each tower starting from the second one.
    for height in tower_heights[1:]:
        # If the current tower is taller than the current hill height, we start a new hill.
        if height > current_hill_height:
            sum_hill_heights += height
            current_hill_height = height
        # If we encounter a shorter tower, update the current hill height to this tower's height.
        elif height < current_hill_height:
            current_hill_height = height
    
    return sum_hill_heights

# Read the heights from `deal.in`
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read N, the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # Read tower heights into a list

# Calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills.
sum_hill_heights = calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights)

# Write the result to `deal.out`
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(sum_hill_heights))
```

This revised solution corrects the logic by updating the current hill height when a shorter tower is encountered. This will ensure that subsequent taller towers can form new hills that contribute to the overall sum.

Please copy the updated code block above, which should now produce the correct result for the given input.

The previous attempts at solving the problem were incorrect because they did not accumulate the heights for the subsequent hills correctly. Specifically, the logic did not handle the scenario where a sequence of non-increasing towers can still be part of a hill, contributing to the sum if they follow a taller tower.

We need to identify each sequence of non-decreasing towers (i.e., where each tower is greater than or equal to the preceding one), as each one constitutes a hill according to the problem statement. The height of each hill is the height of the last tower in the non-decreasing sequence.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills using the tower heights.
def calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights):
    # Initialize the sum of hill heights to zero.
    sum_hill_heights = 0
    # Start with the first hill which consists of the first tower.
    current_hill_height = tower_heights[0]

    # Iterate over each tower starting from the second one.
    for i in range(1, len(tower_heights)):
        # If the current tower is greater than or equal to the previous one,
        # it is part of the current hill, so we update the current hill height.
        if tower_heights[i] >= tower_heights[i - 1]:
            current_hill_height = tower_heights[i]
        else:
            # If the current tower is smaller than the previous one,
            # the previous hill has ended, so we add its height to the sum.
            sum_hill_heights += current_hill_height
            # Start a new hill with the current tower.
            current_hill_height = tower_heights[i]
    # Add the height of the last hill to the sum.
    sum_hill_heights += current_hill_height
    
    return sum_hill_heights

# Read the heights from `deal.in`
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read N, the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # Read tower heights into a list

# Calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills.
sum_hill_heights = calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights)

# Write the result to `deal.out`
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(sum_hill_heights))
```

This code should correctly identify each hill and accumulate their heights accordingly. Please copy the updated code block above, which should now provide the correct result for the given input.

The issue with the previous solution is that it only checks if the current tower height is greater than or equal to the previous one to continue the hill. However, when there's a decrease in height, we should not only end the current hill but also skip all subsequent towers that are of lesser or equal height until we find a tower that's taller than the last tower of the previous hill. That taller tower will start a new hill.

Let's rewrite the solution to correctly form hills and accumulate their heights:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills using the tower heights.
def calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights):
    sum_hill_heights = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(tower_heights):
        # Start a new hill with the current tower.
        hill_height = tower_heights[i]
        # Move to the next tower.
        i += 1
        # Continue moving to the next tower as long as it is of equal or lesser height than the current hill.
        while i < len(tower_heights) and tower_heights[i] <= hill_height:
            i += 1
        # Add the current hill's height to the sum.
        sum_hill_heights += hill_height

    return sum_hill_heights

# Read the heights from `deal.in`
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read N, the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # Read tower heights into a list

# Calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills.
sum_hill_heights = calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights)

# Write the result to `deal.out`
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(sum_hill_heights))
```

This revised solution now correctly skips towers that cannot start a new hill because they are not taller than the peak of the previous hill. It then starts a new hill when it encounters a taller tower and adds the height of the last hill before finding a taller tower. 

Please copy the updated code block above, which should now yield the correct output for the given input.

Upon reviewing the problem and the previous solutions, it appears that the logic to find the maximum possible sum of hill heights is still incorrect. The error is in how we're processing the towers to form the hills. 

The correct approach should be as follows:

1. Start with the first tower to form the first hill.
2. Iterate through the list of towers.
3. If the current tower is taller than the previously used one, add its height to the sum and consider it as the new peak of the current hill.
4. If the current tower is shorter than or equal to the previously used one, it cannot contribute to increasing the height of the current hill. Thus, we need to end the current hill and consider the current tower as the start of a new hill.

Now, let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills using the tower heights.
def calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights):
    # Initialize the sum of hill heights to zero.
    sum_hill_heights = 0
    # The height of the previous tower, initialized to 0.
    prev_height = 0

    # Iterate over each tower.
    for height in tower_heights:
        # If the current tower height is greater than the previous tower height, it can form a hill.
        if height > prev_height:
            sum_hill_heights += height
            prev_height = height

    return sum_hill_heights

# Read the heights from `deal.in`
with open('deal.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read N, the number of towers
    tower_heights = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))  # Read tower heights into a list

# Calculate the sum of heights of the formed hills.
sum_hill_heights = calculate_sum_of_hills(tower_heights)

# Write the result to `deal.out`
with open('deal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(sum_hill_heights))
```

This code should now correctly accumulate the heights of the hills that are formed by the towers in the order they are given. With the input data provided, the expected output of `22` should be achieved. Please copy the updated code block above, which should now provide the correct result for the given input.
