Corina a cumpărat de la magazin un material din pânză colorată, de formă dreptunghiulară pentru a decupa din el o față de masă pentru masa din bucătărie. Fiindcă este pasionată de șah, Corina a ales un material format din $n \times m$ pătrate de aceeași dimensiune colorate cu alb sau negru. Pătratele sunt lipite și sunt dispuse pe linii și coloane paralele cu laturile dreptunghiului din pânză care a fost cumpărat. Două pătrate se numesc vecine dacă au în comun o latură.

Materialul din pânză nu respectă neapărat structura unei table de șah, adică pătratele vecine pe aceeași linie sau pe aceeași coloană nu sunt în mod necesar colorate în mod alternativ.

Corina își propune prin urmare să decupeze un dreptunghi cu un număr maxim de pătrate, paralel cu laturile dreptunghiului din pânză care a fost cumpărat, care să respecte alternanța culorilor pe o tablă de șah.

# Cerință
Să se determine numărul maxim de pătrate întregi ale unui dreptunghi cu laturile paralele cu cele ale materialului cumpărat, care poate fi decupat astfel încât să nu existe două pătrate vecine având aceeași culoare.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul `fadema.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $n$ și $m$ reprezentând numărul de linii, respectiv numărul de coloane ale materialului din pânză care a fost cumpărat.
Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii se află câte $m$ cifre `0` sau `1` despărțite prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând culorile pătratelor materialului. Cifra `0` codifică culoarea albă, iar cifra `1` codifică culoarea neagră.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul `fadema.out` va conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural $A$, reprezentând numărul maxim de pătrate ale unui dreptunghi care poate fi decupat astfel încât să respecte cerința din enunț. Dacă nu există dreptunghiuri cu cel puțin două pătrate având culori alternante, se va scrie valoarea $1$.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $2 \leq N \leq 1\ 000$
- $2 \leq M \leq 1\ 000$
- Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței respectând restricțiile problemei se acordă 90 de puncte.
- Pentru rezultate corecte respectând restricțiile problemei și $n, m \leq 100$ se acordă 20 de puncte.
- Pentru rezultate corecte respectând restricțiile problemei și $n, m \leq 200$ se acordă 40 de puncte.

                    upper_left_color = fabric[i - 1][j - 1]
                    if fabric[i][j] != upper_left_color:
                        dp[i][j][fabric[i][j]] = min(dp[i - 1][j][1 - fabric[i][j]], dp[i][j - 1][1 - fabric[i][j]],
                                                      dp[i - 1][j - 1][1 - fabric[i][j]]) + 1

    return max_squares

fabric = read_input('fadema.in')
max_squares = find_max_chessboard(fabric)

```
```

This solution reads the input from the file `fadema.in`, processes it to find the maximum number of squares of a rectangle that can be cut out following the chessboard pattern, and writes the result to `fadema.out`. The use of NumPy should ensure that the memory usage remains within the constraints, and the dynamic programming approach should ensure an efficient runtime. The solution avoids using Python's built-in list structures excessively to prevent high memory use and relies on the NumPy array which is more memory-efficient.

It seems that the environment where the code is run does not have the `numpy` library available. Since we cannot use external libraries such as `numpy`, I will rewrite the solution using only Python's built-in functionalities to ensure compatibility and adherence to the memory constraint.

Here is the updated solution without using `numpy` or any other external library:

```python
def find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m):
    dp = [[[0, 0] for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    max_squares = 1

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                dp[i][j][fabric[i][j]] = 1
            else:
                if fabric[i][j] != fabric[i - 1][j] and fabric[i][j] != fabric[i][j - 1]:
                    upper_left_color = fabric[i - 1][j - 1]
                    if fabric[i][j] != upper_left_color:
                        dp[i][j][fabric[i][j]] = min(dp[i - 1][j][1 - fabric[i][j]], dp[i][j - 1][1 - fabric[i][j]],
                                                      dp[i - 1][j - 1][1 - fabric[i][j]]) + 1
                        max_squares = max(max_squares, dp[i][j][fabric[i][j]] ** 2)

    return max_squares

# Read input from 'fadema.in'
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    fabric = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        fabric[i] = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Find the maximum number of squares in the chessboard pattern
max_squares = find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m)

# Write output to 'fadema.out'
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_squares))
```

This solution retains the original logic of finding the largest possible chessboard pattern but does away with `numpy` and instead uses lists of lists (2D array) to hold the necessary data. This change ensures that the code does not require any third-party modules and thus solves the issue that caused the program to exit with code 1.

Upon reviewing the initial solution, I realize the error lies in the dynamic programming (DP) state transition. The solution should not only check whether the current square and the upper-left square are of different colors, but it should also ensure that the squares above and to the left are of the opposite color to the current square as well. This is because a valid chessboard pattern requires alternating colors both horizontally and vertically.

I will correct the logic to properly account for this by checking both conditions for the alternating colors and also refactor the code to use a single 2D array for DP since we only need the previous row to calculate the current row. This may further reduce memory consumption.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m):
    # Initialize the DP array with 0s, we only need to keep track of the last row
    dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(2)]
    max_squares = 1

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                dp[i % 2][j] = 1
            else:
                if fabric[i][j] != fabric[i-1][j] and fabric[i][j] != fabric[i][j-1]:
                    dp[i % 2][j] = min(dp[(i-1) % 2][j], dp[i % 2][j-1], dp[(i-1) % 2][j-1]) + 1
                    max_squares = max(max_squares, dp[i % 2][j] ** 2)
                else:
                    dp[i % 2][j] = 0

    return max_squares

# Read input from 'fadema.in'
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    fabric = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the maximum number of squares in the chessboard pattern
max_squares = find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m)

# Write output to 'fadema.out'
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_squares))
```

In this corrected solution, we use a DP array that has two rows to store the results for the current and previous rows. We alternate between these two rows using `i % 2`, to save memory. The logic within the nested loops ensures that we find the largest possible chessboard pattern by checking the colors of neighboring squares. The `max_squares` variable keeps track of the size of the largest pattern found so far, and the result is written to 'fadema.out'.

I see that the previous solution still did not correctly find the largest possible chessboard pattern. It seems that the logic for updating the dynamic programming table is incorrect. Specifically, we need to handle the case in which the current square is part of a larger rectangle, not just a single row or column. 

To fix this, we need to compare the current square with its diagonal neighbor instead of its immediate neighbors above and beside it.

Here is an updated solution that correctly handles this logic:

```python
def find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m):
    max_squares = 1
    # We can reuse the same array for dp since we only need to keep track of the last row
    dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(2)]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                dp[i % 2][j] = 1
            else:
                if fabric[i][j] != fabric[i - 1][j - 1]:
                    dp[i % 2][j] = min(dp[(i - 1) % 2][j], dp[i % 2][j - 1], dp[(i - 1) % 2][j - 1]) + 1
                else:
                    dp[i % 2][j] = 1
                if fabric[i][j] != fabric[i - 1][j]:
                    max_squares = max(max_squares, dp[i % 2][j])

    # Since we are storing lengths of sides of squares, we need to calculate the area
    max_area = max_squares ** 2
    return max_area

# Read input from 'fadema.in'
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    fabric = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the maximum number of squares in the chessboard pattern
max_area = find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m)

# Write output to 'fadema.out'
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_area))
```

In this solution, we're using a rolling 2D array for `dp` where `dp[i % 2][j]` is the side length of the largest square with bottom-right corner at `(i, j)` that forms a valid chessboard pattern. We update `dp[i % 2][j]` based on the minimum of the three adjacent squares' values from the previous iteration, plus 1, only if the current square has a different color than the upper-left diagonal. If the color is the same, we reset it to 1 since it can only form a 1x1 square. Finally, we calculate the area of the square since we're looking for the maximum number of squares, not the side length.

The previous solution still incorrectly calculates the size of the largest valid chessboard pattern, as it does not correctly handle the alternating color condition in both dimensions.

The correct approach to this problem is to maintain two states: one for sub-rectangles where the bottom-right corner square is black (`dp_black`) and one for sub-rectangles where the bottom-right corner square is white (`dp_white`). At each cell, we will update the state depending on the color of the current square and the color of the adjacent squares.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
def find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m):
    # Initialize the DP arrays for both black and white bottom-right corner squares
    dp_black = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    dp_white = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    max_squares = 1

    # Base cases - first row and first column
    for i in range(n):
        dp_black[i][0] = dp_white[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(m):
        dp_black[0][j] = dp_white[0][j] = 1

    # Fill in the DP arrays
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            if fabric[i][j] != fabric[i-1][j] and fabric[i][j] != fabric[i][j-1]:
                if fabric[i][j] == 0:
                    dp_white[i][j] = min(dp_black[i-1][j], dp_black[i][j-1], dp_black[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                    max_squares = max(max_squares, dp_white[i][j])
                else:
                    dp_black[i][j] = min(dp_white[i-1][j], dp_white[i][j-1], dp_white[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                    max_squares = max(max_squares, dp_black[i][j])

    return max_squares * max_squares

# Read input from 'fadema.in'
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    fabric = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the maximum number of squares in the chessboard pattern
max_area = find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m)

# Write output to 'fadema.out'
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_area))
```

In this solution, `dp_black` and `dp_white` are used to track the size of the largest possible chessboard-patterned sub-rectangle with bottom-right corner squares of the respective colors. We start by initializing the first row and column since they will always have sub-rectangles of size 1. Then we iterate over the rest of the fabric, updating our DP arrays by considering the minimum of the three surrounding squares for the opposite color. The `max_squares` variable keeps track of the side length of the largest pattern, and at the end we return the square of it to get the area (number of squares). This solution should correctly compute the desired output for the given problem.

Upon further review, I see there needs to be a clear strategy to account for alternating colors in both horizontal and vertical directions. The solution should track the largest possible chessboard pattern where the colors alternate in both dimensions. The error in the previous solutions was in not correctly updating and comparing the state of each cell with its neighbors.

A correct implementation requires an algorithm that checks not only the adjacent squares but also the potential for creating a larger alternating-colored rectangle. For each cell, we could track the largest alternating-colored rectangle that can be formed ending at that cell. We will use a single value for the DP state as we only need to track the largest side of a valid rectangle at each position (since it must be a square).

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m):
    dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    max_squares = 0

    # Initialize the dp array for the first row and first column
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(m):
        dp[0][j] = 1

    # Process the fabric to fill in the dp array
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            if fabric[i][j] != fabric[i-1][j-1] and fabric[i][j] != fabric[i][j-1] and fabric[i][j] != fabric[i-1][j]:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                max_squares = max(max_squares, dp[i][j])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1

    # Calculate the area of the largest square found
    max_area = max_squares * max_squares
    return max_area

# Read input from 'fadema.in'
with open('fadema.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    fabric = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the maximum number of squares in the chessboard pattern
max_area = find_max_chessboard(fabric, n, m)

# Write output to 'fadema.out'
with open('fadema.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_area))
```

In this solution, we first initialize the first row and column of the DP table since any square in these positions can only form a 1x1 square. Then, for each other cell, we check if it's possible to form a square larger than 1x1. A larger square is possible if the current cell's color is different from the three neighboring cells (top, left, and top-left diagonal). If it's possible, we update the DP table with the size of the largest possible square. The `max_squares` variable keeps track of the side length of the largest square found. After processing the whole fabric, we return the area of the largest square (`max_squares * max_squares`). This should now correctly calculate the expected output.
