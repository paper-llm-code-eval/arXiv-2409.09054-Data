În Roma antică există $n$ aşezări senatoriale distincte, câte una pentru fiecare dintre cei $n$ senatori ai Republicii. Aşezările senatoriale sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, între oricare două aşezări existând legături directe sau indirecte. O legătură este directă dacă ea nu mai trece prin alte aşezări senatoriale intermediare. Edilii au pavat unele dintre legăturile directe dintre două aşezări (numind o astfel de legătură pavată ”stradă“), astfel încât între oricare două aşezări senatoriale să existe o singură succesiune de străzi prin care se poate ajunge de la o aşezare senatorială la cealaltă.

Toţi senatorii trebuie să participe la şedinţele Senatului. In acest scop, ei se deplasează cu lectica. Orice senator care se deplasează pe o stradă plăteşte $1$ ban pentru că a fost transportat cu lectica pe acea stradă.

La alegerea sa ca prim consul, Cezar a promis că va dota Roma cu o lectică gratuită care să circule pe un număr de $k$ străzi ale Romei astfel încât orice senator care va circula pe străzile respective, să poată folosi lectica gratuită fără a plăti. Străzile pe care se deplasează lectica gratuită trebuie să fie legate între ele (zborul, metroul sau teleportarea nefiind posibile la acea vreme). 

În plus, Cezar a promis să stabilească sediul sălii de şedinţe a Senatului într-una dintre aşezările senatoriale aflate pe traseul lecticii gratuite. Problema este de a alege cele $k$ străzi şi amplasarea sediului sălii de şedinţe a Senatului astfel încât, prin folosirea transportului gratuit, senatorii, în drumul lor spre sala de şedinţe, să facă economii cât mai însemnate. În calculul costului total de transport, pentru toţi senatorii, Cezar a considerat că fiecare senator va călători exact o dată de la aşezarea sa până la sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care determină costul minim care se poate obţine prin alegerea adecvată a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului de amplasare a sălii de şedinţă a Senatului.

# Date de intrare 
Fişierul `cezar.in` conţine
- pe prima linie două valori $n\ k$ separate printr-un saţiu reprezentând numărul total de senatori şi numărul de strazi pe care circulă lectica gratuită
- pe următorele $n-1$ linii se află câte două valori $i\ j$ separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numerele de ordine a două aşezări senatoriale între care există stradă.

# Date de ieşire
Pe prima linie a fişierului `cezar.out` se va scrie costul total minim al transportării tuturor senatorilor pentru o alegere optimă a celor $k$ străzi pe care va circula lectica gratuită şi a locului unde va fi amplasată sala de şedinţe a Senatului.

# Restricţii
* $1 < n ≤ 10\ 000, 0 < k < n$
* $1 ≤ i, j ≤ n , i ≠ j$
* Oricare două perechi de valori de pe liniile $2, 3, ..., n$ din fişierul de intrare reprezintă două străzi distincte.
* Perechile din fişierul de intrare sunt date astfel încât respectă condiţiile din problemă.
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $n ≤ 30$
* Pentru $25\%$ din teste $30 < n ≤ 1\ 000$

        return v
    
    centroid = find_centroid(1, -1, subtree_size[1])
    return centroid

centroid = centroid_decomposition(edges, n)

# Calculate the distance of each node from the centroid
distances = np.zeros(n + 1, dtype=np.int32)

def dfs(v, p, d):
    distances[v] = d

tree = {i: set() for i in range(1, n + 1)}
for edge in edges:

    tree[edge[1]].add(edge[0])

dfs(centroid, -1, 0)

# Sort distances and calculate the minimum cost

cost = np.sum(sorted_distances[:-k])

# Write the result to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(cost))
```

This code applies the centroid decomposition to find the center of the tree, calculates distances from the centroid, sorts the distances, and determines the cost by not accounting for the k longest distances (representing the k free streets). The code writes this cost to `cezar.out`. The code uses numpy for efficient array handling, aiming to meet the memory constraints.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed or available in the current environment. Since we are optimizing for memory and the problem constraints are not extremely large, we can solve the problem without using `numpy` or any other external library that is not part of the standard Python library.

I will rewrite the entire solution without using `numpy` or any other external libraries, and ensure it satisfies the constraints specified in the problem.

```python
# We are going to use a list of lists to store edges
edges = []

# Efficiently read data from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

def build_tree(edges):
    tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for edge in edges:

        tree[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    return tree

# Find the center of the tree using centroid decomposition

        for u in tree[v]:
            if u != p:
                subtree_size[v] += dfs(u, v)
        return subtree_size[v]

    dfs(1, -1)

    def find_centroid(v, p, total_nodes):
        for u in tree[v]:
            if u != p and subtree_size[u] > total_nodes // 2:
                return find_centroid(u, v, total_nodes)
        return v

    centroid = find_centroid(1, -1, subtree_size[1])
    return centroid

# Calculate the distance of each node from the centroid
def calculate_distances(tree, centroid):

        for u in tree[v]:
            if u != p:
                dfs(u, v, d + 1)

    return distances

tree = build_tree(edges)
centroid = centroid_decomposition(tree, n)
distances = calculate_distances(tree, centroid)

# Calculate minimum cost by excluding the k largest distances
sorted_distances = sorted(distances[1:])
cost = sum(sorted_distances[:-k])

# Write the result to cezar.out

This solution should also meet the memory constraints, as it avoids using large data structures and optimizes for memory efficiency by using list comprehensions and built-in sorting functions instead of external libraries.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found result suggests that there might be a flaw in the current solution's logic. Upon revisiting the code, I can see that the strategy of selecting the centroid as the senate's location and excluding the longest `k` distances could be suboptimal in some cases.

The correct approach for this problem would be to use a modified Depth-First Search (DFS) to calculate the sum of distances for all nodes and then find the optimal path where the free lectica (i.e., the path with `k` edges) could be placed to minimize the total cost.

To do this, we should:

1. Choose an arbitrary node as the root and perform a DFS to calculate the sum of distances from this root to all other nodes.
2. While performing DFS, also calculate the number of nodes in the subtree of each node.
3. For each node, we can calculate the cost-saving if we were to place the free lectica starting from that node towards its children. The optimal path for the free lectica would be the one that maximizes this saving.
4. The optimal senate location would be on the path where we place the free lectica. We choose the one end of the path as the senate's location that minimizes the total cost.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the data from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Build the tree as an adjacency list
tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
for a, b in edges:
    tree[a].append(b)
    tree[b].append(a)

# Perform DFS to calculate subtree sizes and total distances
subtree_sizes = [1] * (n + 1)
total_dist = [0] * (n + 1)

def dfs(node, parent):
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(child, node)
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
            total_dist[node] += total_dist[child] + subtree_sizes[child]

dfs(1, 0)

# Find the edge that maximizes the saving when k edges are made free
max_saving = 0
total_cost = total_dist[1]

def find_max_saving(node, parent, remaining_k):
    global max_saving
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            saving = (subtree_sizes[child] * min(k, remaining_k))
            max_saving = max(max_saving, saving)
            find_max_saving(child, node, remaining_k - 1)

find_max_saving(1, 0, k)

# The minimum cost is the total cost minus the maximum saving
min_cost = total_cost - max_saving

# Write the result to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This implementation should now correctly identify the optimal paths for the free lectica and place the senate's location, minimizing the total cost according to the problem's requirements.

The approach in the previous solution is still not correct as it does not take into account the optimal placement of the free lectica on the tree. The key issue is that we need to consider the total distance of all senators to the Senate and minimize this by placing the free lectica on the paths that would most reduce the total cost.

Let's adopt a more strategic approach:

1. Perform a DFS to calculate the depth of each node.
2. Sort nodes by decreasing depth since deeper nodes will contribute more to the saving when descending edges are made free.
3. After sorting, choose the top `k` depth nodes and mark their paths to the root as free.
4. Calculate the total cost by checking for each path if it includes a free edge or not.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the data from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Build the tree as an adjacency list
tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
for a, b in edges:
    tree[a].append(b)
    tree[b].append(a)

# Perform DFS to calculate the depth of each node
depths = [0] * (n + 1)
def dfs(node, parent, depth):
    depths[node] = depth
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(child, node, depth + 1)
dfs(1, 0, 0)

# Find nodes with greatest depths (most costly)
# and mark the path from them to the root as free
nodes_by_depth = sorted(range(1, n + 1), key=lambda x: depths[x], reverse=True)
free_edges = set()
current_node = nodes_by_depth[0]
for i in range(k):
    free_edges.add(current_node)
    for parent in tree[current_node]:
        if depths[parent] < depths[current_node]:
            current_node = parent
            break

# Calculate the total cost
total_cost = 0
for node in range(2, n + 1):
    if node not in free_edges:
        total_cost += 1

# Write the result to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_cost))
```

This solution should correctly find the `k` most expensive edges (by depth) and mark them as free, ensuring that the total cost of travel for all senators is minimized according to the problem's rules. The output cost should now match the expected results.

The issue with the previous solutions is the incorrect approach to calculate the maximum saving when `k` edges are made free. Each node in the tree has a certain number of senators that need to travel through it to reach the Senate, and making an edge free would save the cost for all senators in the subtree rooted at that edge's child node.

Let's rethink the solution:

1. We need to calculate the number of senators that would travel through each edge.
2. We should then select `k` edges such that making them free saves the maximum cost.
3. The savings per edge can be calculated as the number of senators in the subtree below the edge times the depth of the edge (weight of the edge).
4. The Senate can be placed at the root of the tree for simplicity.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Read the data from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Build the tree as an adjacency list
tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
for a, b in edges:
    tree[a].append(b)
    tree[b].append(a)

# Function for DFS to calculate subtree sizes and edge savings
subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
edge_savings = []
def dfs(node, parent, depth):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(child, node, depth + 1)
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
            # Calculate the savings for making this edge free
            saving = subtree_sizes[child] * depth
            edge_savings.append((saving, child))

dfs(1, 0, 1)  # Start DFS with depth 1 to count the root edges

# Select the top k edges with maximum savings
edge_savings.sort(reverse=True)
total_savings = sum(saving for saving, child in edge_savings[:k])

# The total initial cost is the sum of depths for all nodes (except the root)
# Given that the tree is undirected and connected, this is equivalent to 2 times the number of edges.
initial_cost = 2 * (n - 1)
min_cost = initial_cost - total_savings

# Write the result to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution calculates the number of senators passing through each edge and the savings we would get by making the edge free. It then selects the `k` edges that maximize these savings and calculates the total cost accordingly. This should provide the correct output as per the problem's requirement.

The issue with the previous solution is in the incorrect calculation of the initial cost and the savings. The initial cost is not simply 2 times the number of edges, and the savings calculation is also incorrect. We need to calculate savings based on the distance that would be made free for each senator.

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Perform DFS to find the count of senators (nodes) beneath each node in the tree (subtree size), starting from the root.
2. Calculate the total cost of travel without any free edges. This is simply the sum of distances for all senators from their respective nodes to the root.
3. While doing the DFS, also calculate the potential savings if an edge leading to a node is made free. This is the product of the subtree size (number of senators that would use that free edge) and the depth of the node (the cost saved for each senator).
4. We want to select `k` edges that maximize the savings, so we sort the potential savings and select the top `k`.
5. The minimum cost is the initial cost minus the sum of these `k` maximum savings.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the data from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Build the tree as an adjacency list
tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
for a, b in edges:
    tree[a].append(b)
    tree[b].append(a)

# Function for DFS to calculate subtree sizes and aggregate total cost
subtree_sizes = [1] * (n + 1)
total_cost = 0
savings = []
def dfs(node, parent, depth):
    global total_cost
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(child, node, depth + 1)
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
            # Potential savings if this edge is made free
            savings.append(subtree_sizes[child] * depth)
    # Cost for this node (depth * number of times used by senators in the subtree)
    if node != 1:  # Exclude the root since it's the Senate's location
        total_cost += depth * subtree_sizes[node]

dfs(1, 0, 1)  # Start DFS with depth 1 to count the root edges

# Calculate the savings for the k free edges
savings.sort(reverse=True)
max_savings = sum(savings[:k])

# The minimum cost is the total cost minus the savings from the free edges
min_cost = total_cost - max_savings

# Write the result to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the minimum cost by taking into account the total travel cost and the savings from the `k` free edges. It should provide the correct output for the example and satisfy the problem's constraints.

Apologies for the confusion in previous attempts. The discrepancy is due to an incorrect calculation of the total cost and savings.

The correct approach to solve this problem should be:

1. Perform a DFS from an arbitrary node to calculate depths (distance from the root) of each node, which represents the cost of each senator traveling to the Senate located at the root node.
2. During DFS, also calculate the size of the subtree for each node, representing how many senators would save money if this path is made free.
3. After DFS, for each node, calculate the saving as (subtree size) * (depth of the node), which represents how much total cost would decrease if the path from this node to its parent is made free.
4. Sort the calculated savings in descending order and select the top `k` savings.
5. The total initial cost is the sum of all depths since each node's depth contributes to the cost for one senator's travel to the Senate.
6. Subtract the top `k` savings from the total initial cost to get the minimum total cost possible with `k` free edges.

Let's implement this solution correctly:

```python
# Read the data from cezar.in
with open('cezar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Build the tree as an adjacency list
tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
for a, b in edges:
    tree[a].append(b)
    tree[b].append(a)

# Perform DFS to calculate depths and subtree sizes
depths = [0] * (n + 1)
subtree_sizes = [1] * (n + 1)
def dfs(node, parent, depth):
    depths[node] = depth
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(child, node, depth + 1)
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]

dfs(1, 0, 0)  # Start DFS from node 1

# Calculate savings for each edge and total cost
savings = []
total_cost = sum(depths)
for node in range(2, n + 1):  # Skipping the root node
    parent = next(p for p in tree[node] if depths[p] < depths[node])
    savings.append(subtree_sizes[node] * (depths[node] - depths[parent]))

# Select the k edges that give the maximum savings
savings.sort(reverse=True)
total_savings = sum(savings[:k])

# Calculate the minimum total cost
min_cost = total_cost - total_savings

# Write the result to cezar.out
with open('cezar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(min_cost))
```

This solution should now correctly identify the edges which, when made free, yield the maximum savings, and therefore minimize the total cost. The output should match the expected result.
