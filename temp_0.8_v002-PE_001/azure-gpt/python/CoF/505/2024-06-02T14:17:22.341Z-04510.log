Cei $N$ copii de la școala generală vor să formeze o echipă de fotbal compusă din $K$ elevi, dintre care cel puțin unul stângaci și cel puțin unul dreptaci. Pentru fiecare copil $i$ (de la $0$ la $N-1$) se cunoaște intervalul de timp în care acesta este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, sub forma unei perechi, $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$, cât și dacă este stângaci sau dreptaci. $K$ copii pot juca în aceeași echipa dacă intervalele de timp în care aceștia sunt disponibili se suprapun în cel puțin un punct (moment de timp).

# Cerință

Se cere numărul de moduri în care se poate alcătui o echipă cu $K$ dintre cei $N$ elevi; deoarece acest număr poate să fie foarte mare, el se va afișa modulo $10^9+9$.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `fotbal.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc câte 3 numere naturale, $start_{i}$, $end_{i}$, $f_{i}$, unde $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$ reprezintă intervalul de timp în care al $i$-lea copil este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, iar $f_{i}$ reprezintă piciorul cu care joacă al $i$-lea copil, $f_{i}=1$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este dreptaci și $f_{i}=0$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este stângaci.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `fotbal.out` va conține doar numărul de moduri cerut, în forma precizată în cerință. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq start_{i} \leq end_{i} \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* $f_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $K = 2$ și $2 \le N \le 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $K = 2$ și există cel mult $5$ copii care sunt stângaci;
* Pentru $33$ de puncte, $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment. Since the requirements of the original challenge mention optimizing for both time and memory and suggest using "highly efficient libraries whenever possible," it seems like the use of `numpy` was intended. However, if `numpy` cannot be used due to the environment's limitations, we'll need to implement an efficient solution without it.

The code below is an optimized solution that does not use `numpy` or any external libraries to ensure it will run in any standard Python environment.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 9

def modinv(a, m):
    return pow(a, m - 2, m)

def nCr_mod(n, r, mod):
    if r > n:
        return 0
    numerator = 1
    for i in range(r):
        numerator = (numerator * (n - i)) % mod
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(1, r + 1):
        denominator = (denominator * i) % mod
    return (numerator * modinv(denominator, mod)) % mod

# Read input from 'fotbal.in'
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, K = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    players = []
    for _ in range(N):
        start, end, foot = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
        players.append((start, end, foot))

# Sort players by end time
players.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

# Count the number of teams
count = 0
left_footed_players = [0] * (max(p[1] for p in players) + 1)
right_footed_players = [0] * (max(p[1] for p in players) + 1)
for i in range(N):
    # Mark the right-footed and left-footed players
    if players[i][2] == 1:
        right_footed_players[players[i][1]] += 1
    else:
        left_footed_players[players[i][1]] += 1

# Prefix sums to count the number of players available up to each time
for i in range(1, len(left_footed_players)):
    left_footed_players[i] += left_footed_players[i-1]
    right_footed_players[i] += right_footed_players[i-1]

# Calculate the number of combinations
for i in range(N):
    left_available = left_footed_players[players[i][1]]
    right_available = right_footed_players[players[i][1]]
    if left_available > 0 and right_available > 0:
        teams_with_both_feet = nCr_mod(left_available + right_available - 2, K - 2, MOD)

The discrepancy in the output is due to a logical error in the implementation of counting combinations. The solution as provided does not account for the fact that within a given interval, we must ensure that there is at least one left-footed and one right-footed player available.

We need to adjust the algorithm to consider the total number of available players by the end time of each player, ensuring that we have at least one player of each foot type. We then need to iterate through all players and for each, check how many combinations are possible with the available players up to that point (considering at least one left-footed and one right-footed player).

I will now provide the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 9

# Function to calculate the modular inverse
def modinv(a, m):
    return pow(a, m - 2, m)

# Function to calculate n choose r modulo MOD
def nCr_mod(n, r, mod):
    if r > n or r < 0:
        return 0
    numerator = 1
    for i in range(r):
        numerator = (numerator * (n - i)) % mod
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(1, r + 1):
        denominator = (denominator * i) % mod
    return (numerator * modinv(denominator, mod)) % mod

# Read input from 'fotbal.in'
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, K = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    players = []
    left_count, right_count = 0, 0
    for _ in range(N):
        start, end, foot = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
        players.append((start, end, foot))
        if foot == 0:
            left_count += 1
        else:
            right_count += 1

# Sort players based on their availability end times
players.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

# Count the number of teams
count = 0
for i in range(N):
    # Calculate the number of players with overlapping availability
    overlap_count = 0
    has_left = has_right = False
    for j in range(N):
        if players[j][0] <= players[i][1] and players[j][1] >= players[i][1]:
            overlap_count += 1
            if players[j][2] == 0:
                has_left = True
            else:
                has_right = True
    
    # Ensure at least one left-footed and one right-footed player
    if has_left and has_right and overlap_count >= K:
        # Calculate the number of combinations
        count = (count + nCr_mod(overlap_count - 2, K - 2, MOD)) % MOD

# Write output to 'fotbal.out'
with open('fotbal.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(count))
```

This solution checks for each player (considered as the last player based on the end time) how many players are available to play with them and ensures at least one player of each type is available. Then it calculates the number of ways to pick the remaining players to form a team of size `K`. The combinations are modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers.

The result is still incorrect because my previous solution only considered players whose availability ends at the same time as the current player. I should instead be considering all players whose availability intervals overlap with the current player's availability, regardless of their end times. Additionally, I need to ensure the team meets the criteria of having at least one left-footed and one right-footed player.

I'm going to rewrite the solution with a correct approach. I'll check all pairs of players to see if their intervals overlap, and then count the number of valid teams that satisfy the conditions.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 9

def count_teams(N, K, players):
    count = 0
    for i in range(N):
        overlap_left = overlap_right = 0
        for j in range(N):
            if not (players[j][0] > players[i][1] or players[j][1] < players[i][0]):
                if players[j][2] == 0:  # left-footed
                    overlap_left += 1
                else:  # right-footed
                    overlap_right += 1
        if overlap_left and overlap_right:
            total_players = overlap_left + overlap_right
            if K == 2:
                count += overlap_left * overlap_right
            else:
                for l in range(1, min(overlap_left, K - 1)):
                    r = K - l - 1
                    if r > 0 and r <= overlap_right:
                        count += nCr_mod(overlap_left, l, MOD) * nCr_mod(overlap_right, r, MOD)
                        count %= MOD
    return count // 2  # Each pair is counted twice

# Read input from 'fotbal.in'
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, K = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    players = [tuple(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Sort players by start time for efficient overlap checks
players.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

# Calculate the number of teams
count = count_teams(N, K, players)

# Write output to 'fotbal.out'
with open('fotbal.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(count))
```

This updated solution should now correctly output `5` for the provided input. The function `count_teams` iterates over all players and counts how many valid teams can be formed with each player, considering the overlap of availability intervals and the requirement of having at least one left-footed and one right-footed player. The final count is divided by 2 to account for double counting each pair of players.
