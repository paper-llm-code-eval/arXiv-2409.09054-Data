Cei $N$ copii de la școala generală vor să formeze o echipă de fotbal compusă din $K$ elevi, dintre care cel puțin unul stângaci și cel puțin unul dreptaci. Pentru fiecare copil $i$ (de la $0$ la $N-1$) se cunoaște intervalul de timp în care acesta este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, sub forma unei perechi, $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$, cât și dacă este stângaci sau dreptaci. $K$ copii pot juca în aceeași echipa dacă intervalele de timp în care aceștia sunt disponibili se suprapun în cel puțin un punct (moment de timp).

# Cerință

Se cere numărul de moduri în care se poate alcătui o echipă cu $K$ dintre cei $N$ elevi; deoarece acest număr poate să fie foarte mare, el se va afișa modulo $10^9+9$.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `fotbal.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc câte 3 numere naturale, $start_{i}$, $end_{i}$, $f_{i}$, unde $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$ reprezintă intervalul de timp în care al $i$-lea copil este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, iar $f_{i}$ reprezintă piciorul cu care joacă al $i$-lea copil, $f_{i}=1$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este dreptaci și $f_{i}=0$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este stângaci.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `fotbal.out` va conține doar numărul de moduri cerut, în forma precizată în cerință. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq start_{i} \leq end_{i} \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* $f_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $K = 2$ și $2 \le N \le 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $K = 2$ și există cel mult $5$ copii care sunt stângaci;
* Pentru $33$ de puncte, $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

Given the error message indicating that the `numpy` module is not available, I will rewrite the solution using only the standard Python libraries to ensure that it does not rely on any third-party packages. This should address the memory constraint as well.

Here is the revised program without the `numpy` dependency:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 9

# Function to calculate factorial modulo MOD
def factorial_mod(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = (result * i) % MOD
    return result

# Function to calculate modular inverse
def inv_mod(x):
    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)

# Function to calculate combinations modulo MOD
def comb(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    numerator = factorial_mod(n)
    denominator = (factorial_mod(k) * factorial_mod(n - k)) % MOD
    return (numerator * inv_mod(denominator)) % MOD

# Efficiently count the number of ways to form a team with K players
def count_teams(N, K, players):
    # Count lefties and righties
    lefties = sum(1 for _, _, foot in players if foot == 0)
    righties = N - lefties

    if lefties == 0 or righties == 0:  # If there are no lefties or no righties
        return 0  # Cannot form a team with at least one lefty and one righty
    
    # Sort intervals by start time
    players.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(N):
        _, end_i, _ = players[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            start_j, _, _ = players[j]
            # If the intervals overlap and can form a team of K members
            if start_j <= end_i and j - i + 1 >= K:
                # Calculate combinations for righties and lefties
                for left_team in range(1, min(lefties, K - 1) + 1):
                    right_team = K - left_team
                    if righties >= right_team:
                        count += (comb(lefties, left_team) * comb(righties, right_team)) % MOD
                        count %= MOD
            else:
                break

    return count

# Read input data
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    players = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Count the number of ways and write to output
number_of_ways = count_teams(N, K, players)
with open('fotbal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{number_of_ways}\n')
```

This code should now correctly read from `fotbal.in` and write the result to `fotbal.out` using only the Python standard libraries. The memory usage should also be within the specified limit since we are not importing or using `numpy` or any other third-party library. The algorithm has been adjusted to sort the players by their start times and to use a nested loop to consider all possible teams that could be formed by overlapping intervals.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output suggests that the implementation is incorrectly counting the number of valid teams. The nested loop approach is not only inefficient but also does not correctly account for overlapping intervals to ensure that exactly $K$ students are on the team, with at least one lefty and one righty. 

We will need to implement a different algorithm that more efficiently counts the overlap of intervals and ensures the team composition requirements are met. To achieve this, we'll sort the students based on their end times and then use a two-pointer approach to find the valid overlapping intervals.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 9

# Function to calculate the modular inverse
def modinv(a):
    return pow(a, MOD - 2, MOD)

# Function to calculate nCr modulo MOD
def nCr(n, r):
    if r == 0:
        return 1
    if r > n:
        return 0
    num = denom = 1
    for i in range(r):
        num = (num * (n - i)) % MOD
        denom = (denom * (i + 1)) % MOD
    return num * modinv(denom) % MOD

# Read input data
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    intervals = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Prepare the data
intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # sort by end time
left_count = sum(1 for *_, f in intervals if f == 0)

# Count the combinations
total_combinations = 0
right_pointer = 0
lefties = righties = 0

for left_pointer in range(N):
    while right_pointer < N and intervals[right_pointer][1] <= intervals[left_pointer][1]:
        if intervals[right_pointer][2] == 0:
            lefties += 1
        else:
            righties += 1
        right_pointer += 1

    # If we have at least K players and at least one lefty and one righty
    if right_pointer - left_pointer >= K and lefties > 0 and righties > 0:
        total_combinations += (nCr(lefties, 1) * nCr(righties, K - 1) + 
                               nCr(lefties, K - 1) * nCr(righties, 1)) % MOD
    total_combinations %= MOD

    # Move the left_pointer forward, adjusting the counts
    if intervals[left_pointer][2] == 0:
        lefties -= 1
    else:
        righties -= 1

# Write output data
with open('fotbal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_combinations}\n')
```

This solution uses a sliding window approach (two-pointer technique) and calculates the number of teams that can be formed with at least one lefty and one righty. It adjusts the counts of lefties and righties as the window moves. We compute the combinations of choosing 1 lefty and K-1 righties and vice versa, ensuring that we always have at least one of each.
