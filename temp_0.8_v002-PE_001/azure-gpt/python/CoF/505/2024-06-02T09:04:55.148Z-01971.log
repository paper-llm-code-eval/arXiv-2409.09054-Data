Cei $N$ copii de la școala generală vor să formeze o echipă de fotbal compusă din $K$ elevi, dintre care cel puțin unul stângaci și cel puțin unul dreptaci. Pentru fiecare copil $i$ (de la $0$ la $N-1$) se cunoaște intervalul de timp în care acesta este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, sub forma unei perechi, $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$, cât și dacă este stângaci sau dreptaci. $K$ copii pot juca în aceeași echipa dacă intervalele de timp în care aceștia sunt disponibili se suprapun în cel puțin un punct (moment de timp).

# Cerință

Se cere numărul de moduri în care se poate alcătui o echipă cu $K$ dintre cei $N$ elevi; deoarece acest număr poate să fie foarte mare, el se va afișa modulo $10^9+9$.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `fotbal.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc câte 3 numere naturale, $start_{i}$, $end_{i}$, $f_{i}$, unde $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$ reprezintă intervalul de timp în care al $i$-lea copil este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, iar $f_{i}$ reprezintă piciorul cu care joacă al $i$-lea copil, $f_{i}=1$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este dreptaci și $f_{i}=0$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este stângaci.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `fotbal.out` va conține doar numărul de moduri cerut, în forma precizată în cerință. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq start_{i} \leq end_{i} \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* $f_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $K = 2$ și $2 \le N \le 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $K = 2$ și există cel mult $5$ copii care sunt stângaci;
* Pentru $33$ de puncte, $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())

        for _ in range(N):
            start, end, foot = map(int, file.readline().split())
            intervals.append((start, end))
            if foot == 0:
                left_count += 1
            else:

    count = 0
    for time, event_type, i in events:

            current_players.add(i)
            if len(current_players) == K:
                # Check for at least one left and right footed player
                player_intervals = [intervals[j] for j in current_players]
                left_in_team = any(intervals[j][2] == 0 for j in current_players)
                right_in_team = any(intervals[j][2] == 1 for j in current_players)
                if left_in_team and right_in_team:
                    min_end = min(interval[1] for interval in player_intervals)
                    max_start = max(interval[0] for interval in player_intervals)
                    if min_end >= max_start:
                        count += 1
                        count %= MOD
        else:
            current_players.discard(i)
    
    return count

def write_data(file_path, result):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def main():
    N, K, intervals, left_count, right_count = read_data('fotbal.in')
    result = count_teams(N, K, intervals, left_count, right_count)

We read the data from `fotbal.in`, including the number of children `N`, the size `K` of the team needed, the intervals of availability for each child, and the count of left and right-footed players. We sort all start and end times of the intervals and use a sweep line algorithm to track which players are currently available. We check for a valid team whenever we reach the desired team size `K` and ensure that both left and right-footed players are included. The result is written to `fotbal.out`.

Please note that the constraints of this challenge (N <= 100,000 and interval end times up to 1,000,000,000) may require more memory optimization or a different approach to avoid exceeding the 8MB memory limit. Since the provided details do not specify the exact memory usage of each part of the program, this solution is provided with the assumption that it fits within the memory limit. If it does not, a more memory-efficient data structure or algorithm would be needed.

The error indicates that `numpy` is not available in the environment, and since we are not actually using `numpy` in the provided solution, we can simply remove the import statement for `numpy`. Moreover, the given solution does not properly handle the construction of teams by considering the overlapping intervals of availability and the requirement of having at least one left-footed and one right-footed player. The efficient way to handle this would be to use sweep line algorithm but with an efficient way to count the number of left and right-footed players in the current team set.

Here is the corrected and optimized solution without using `numpy`:

```python
MOD = int(1e9+9)

def read_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        intervals = []
        for _ in range(N):
            start, end, foot = map(int, file.readline().split())
            intervals.append((start, end, foot))
    return N, K, intervals

def count_teams(N, K, intervals):
    events = []
    for i, (start, end, foot) in enumerate(intervals):
        events.append((start, 's', foot))
        events.append((end, 'e', foot))

    events.sort()
    left_count = right_count = 0
    available_players = 0
    count = 0
    
    for time, event_type, foot in events:
        if event_type == 's':
            available_players += 1
            left_count += foot == 0
            right_count += foot == 1
        else:
            available_players -= 1
            left_count -= foot == 0
            right_count -= foot == 1
        
        if available_players == K and left_count > 0 and right_count > 0:
            count += 1
            count %= MOD
    
    return count

def write_data(file_path, result):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def main():
    N, K, intervals = read_data('fotbal.in')
    result = count_teams(N, K, intervals)
    write_data('fotbal.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the input data from `fotbal.in`, processes it to count the number of teams that can be formed according to the rules, and writes the output to `fotbal.out`. It uses a sweep line algorithm to efficiently track the number of available players and ensures that there is at least one left-footed and one right-footed player in the team before incrementing the count. Each team formation is counted at the moment when a player's availability ends (event type 'e') provided there are enough players and the footedness condition is met. The count is then output to the `fotbal.out` file. Please keep in mind that this solution assumes that the memory usage is within the provided limits.

The issue with the previous solution is that it increments the count whenever the number of available players is equal to `K`, without actually checking if these players have overlapping intervals. We need to ensure that there is an overlapping interval where all `K` players are available at the same time, with at least one left-footed and one right-footed player among them.

To fix this, we must change our method of tracking available players. Instead of incrementing the count when the number of available players reaches `K`, we should only increment it when we find overlapping intervals for `K` players that satisfy the footedness condition.

Let's rewrite the solution to fix this issue:

```python
MOD = int(1e9+9)

def read_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        intervals = []
        for _ in range(N):
            start, end, foot = map(int, file.readline().split())
            intervals.append((start, end, foot))
    return N, K, intervals

def count_teams(N, K, intervals):
    events = []
    for i, (start, end, foot) in enumerate(intervals):
        events.append((start, 's', foot, i))
        events.append((end, 'e', foot, i))

    events.sort()
    active = [0] * N  # Active players
    count = 0
    left_count = right_count = 0

    for time, event_type, foot, index in events:
        if event_type == 's':
            active[index] = 1
            if foot == 0:
                left_count += 1
            else:
                right_count += 1
        else:
            active[index] = 0
            if foot == 0:
                left_count -= 1
            else:
                right_count -= 1
        
        if active.count(1) >= K:
            # Check if there is an overlap for K players
            overlap = 0
            left_footed = 0
            right_footed = 0
            for idx, act in enumerate(active):
                if act == 1:
                    if intervals[idx][2] == 0:
                        left_footed += 1
                    else:
                        right_footed += 1
                    overlap += 1
                if overlap == K:
                    break
            if overlap == K and left_footed > 0 and right_footed > 0:
                count = (count + 1) % MOD

    return count

def write_data(file_path, result):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def main():
    N, K, intervals = read_data('fotbal.in')
    result = count_teams(N, K, intervals)
    write_data('fotbal.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution keeps track of active players by using an array. When an event occurs, we update the active player's status and footedness counts. We only count a valid team if there are at least `K` active players with at least one left-footed and one right-footed player. In this solution, we directly check the conditions for forming a team whenever a player's availability starts or ends. The result is then written to `fotbal.out`. This solution should now correctly count the number of ways to form a team with at least one left and right-footed player.
