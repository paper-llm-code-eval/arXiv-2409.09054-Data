Cei $N$ copii de la școala generală vor să formeze o echipă de fotbal compusă din $K$ elevi, dintre care cel puțin unul stângaci și cel puțin unul dreptaci. Pentru fiecare copil $i$ (de la $0$ la $N-1$) se cunoaște intervalul de timp în care acesta este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, sub forma unei perechi, $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$, cât și dacă este stângaci sau dreptaci. $K$ copii pot juca în aceeași echipa dacă intervalele de timp în care aceștia sunt disponibili se suprapun în cel puțin un punct (moment de timp).

# Cerință

Se cere numărul de moduri în care se poate alcătui o echipă cu $K$ dintre cei $N$ elevi; deoarece acest număr poate să fie foarte mare, el se va afișa modulo $10^9+9$.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `fotbal.in` se găsesc numerele $N$ și $K$. Pe următoarele $N$ linii, se găsesc câte 3 numere naturale, $start_{i}$, $end_{i}$, $f_{i}$, unde $[start_{i}, end_{i}]$ reprezintă intervalul de timp în care al $i$-lea copil este disponibil pentru a face parte din echipă, iar $f_{i}$ reprezintă piciorul cu care joacă al $i$-lea copil, $f_{i}=1$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este dreptaci și $f_{i}=0$ dacă al $i$-lea copil este stângaci.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `fotbal.out` va conține doar numărul de moduri cerut, în forma precizată în cerință. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq start_{i} \leq end_{i} \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* $f_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$, pentru orice $i$ de la $0$ la $N-1$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $K = 2$ și $2 \le N \le 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $K = 2$ și există cel mult $5$ copii care sunt stângaci;
* Pentru $33$ de puncte, $2 \leq K \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
MOD = 10**9 + 9

# Reading input data
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    children = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Initializations
lefties = []
righties = []
for start, end, foot in children:
    if foot == 0:
        lefties.append((start, end))
    else:
        righties.append((start, end))

# Sorting by end time
lefties.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
righties.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

# Calculate overlapping intervals
def count_overlapping(interval_set, K):
    starts = np.array([x[0] for x in interval_set])
    ends = np.array([x[1] for x in interval_set])
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(interval_set)):
        if K == 1:
            count += 1
        else:
            overlap_mask = (starts <= ends[i]) & (ends >= ends[i])
            overlaps = np.sum(overlap_mask)
            if overlaps >= K:
                count += comb(overlaps - 1, K - 1, MOD)
    return count % MOD

# Custom combination function with modulo
def comb(n, k, mod):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    num = den = 1
    for i in range(1, min(k, n - k) + 1):
        num = (num * (n + 1 - i)) % mod
        den = (den * i) % mod
    return (num * pow(den, mod - 2, mod)) % mod

# Computing the total number of ways
total_ways = count_overlapping(lefties, K) + count_overlapping(righties, K) - count_overlapping(children, K)
total_ways %= MOD

# Writing output data
with open('fotbal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_ways}\n')
```
```

This code reads the input from `fotbal.in`, processes the data to calculate the number of ways to form a football team with the given requirements, and writes the output to `fotbal.out`. The `count_overlapping` function is used to calculate overlapping intervals for lefties and righties separately and together, and the custom `comb` function calculates combinations with respect to the large prime modulo. The solution is memory-efficient and makes use of NumPy for array operations to optimize performance.

            if len(valid_players) >= k:

# Calculate result
teams_count = find_teams_count(n, k, availability, MOD)

# Write output data
save_output('fotbal.out', teams_count)
```

This revised Python solution reads the input data from 'fotbal.in', calculates the number of ways to form a football team with at least one left-footed and one right-footed player, and writes the result to 'fotbal.out'. It uses numpy for efficient array manipulation and scipy's comb function for calculating combinations with a modulo.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found. Since the code is required to be memory-efficient, and considering the provided error message, it seems that we are not able to use `numpy` or external libraries like `scipy` in this environment. As such, I will rewrite the solution using only built-in Python libraries, avoiding the use of `numpy` and `scipy`.

Additionally, to optimize memory usage, I will avoid storing all children in memory at once. Instead, I will process them as they are read from the file.

Here is the updated solution:

```python
# Constants
MOD = 10**9 + 9

def load_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        intervals = []
        for _ in range(n):
            start, end, foot = map(int, file.readline().split())
            intervals.append((start, end, foot))
    return n, k, intervals

def comb(n, k, mod):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        result = result * (n - i + 1) // i
    return result % mod

def count_intervals(n, k, intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by ending times
    left_counts, right_counts, both_counts = 0, 0, 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        start_i, end_i, foot_i = intervals[i]
        count = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            start_j, end_j, _ = intervals[j]
            if start_j <= end_i:
                count += 1
        
        if count >= k:
            if foot_i == 0:
                left_counts += comb(count - 1, k - 1, MOD)
            else:
                right_counts += comb(count - 1, k - 1, MOD)
            both_counts += comb(count - 1, k - 1, MOD)
    
    left_counts %= MOD
    right_counts %= MOD
    both_counts %= MOD
    return (left_counts + right_counts - both_counts) % MOD

def save_output(filename, data):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f'{data}\n')

# Read input data
n, k, intervals = load_input('fotbal.in')

# Calculate result
teams_count = count_intervals(n, k, intervals)

# Write output data
save_output('fotbal.out', teams_count)
```

This code should perform within the constraints of memory usage and without the need for numpy or any external libraries. It also performs the combination calculation using a custom function that works under the modulo provided.

The initial solution incorrectly calculates the number of combinations for forming a team. It sorts the intervals by the end times, which is correct, but the logic to calculate the overlaps and combinations is flawed. Specifically, the current code does not consider the footedness correctly when summing up the counts for left-footed, right-footed, and total children. We must ensure that each team has at least one left-footed and one right-footed player.

Here's the corrected and efficient solution without using numpy:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 9

# A custom combination function that calculates nCk % MOD
def comb(n, k):
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    k = min(k, n - k)  # Take advantage of symmetry
    numerator = denominator = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        denominator = (denominator * i) % MOD
        numerator = (numerator * (n - i + 1)) % MOD
    # Modular multiplicative inverse (using Fermat's little theorem since MOD is prime)
    inverse_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)
    return (numerator * inverse_denominator) % MOD

def find_teams_count(n, k, players):
    lefties = [p for p in players if p[2] == 0]
    righties = [p for p in players if p[2] == 1]

    lefties.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    righties.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    def count_teams(sorted_players):
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(sorted_players)):
            _, end_time = sorted_players[i][:2]
            count = 0
            # Count how many players are available at end_time of the i-th player
            for start, end in sorted_players:
                if start <= end_time:
                    count += 1
            result += comb(count - 1, k - 1)
        return result % MOD

    total_lefties = count_teams(lefties)
    total_righties = count_teams(righties)
    total_teams = count_teams(players)

    # Subtract the cases where all players are either lefties or righties
    return (total_teams - total_lefties - total_righties) % MOD

# Read input data
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    players = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Calculate result
teams_count = find_teams_count(n, k, players)

# Write output data
with open('fotbal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(teams_count))
```

In this corrected solution, we are keeping track of left-footed and right-footed players separately. We calculate the number of ways to form a team with all players, only left-footed players, and only right-footed players, then subtract the last two from the first to ensure that we only count teams with at least one player of each footedness. The `comb` function calculates the combinations modulo `MOD`, avoiding large intermediate values that could lead to memory issues.

The error arises from trying to unpack three values from the `sorted_players` list when we expect only two (start and end times). This is because the players' list includes a third value (footedness), which we did not account for in the loop.

Let's fix this issue by correctly unpacking all three values in the `count_teams` function and then rewriting the complete solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 9

def comb(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        result = result * (n - i + 1) // i
    return result % MOD

def find_teams_count(n, k, players):
    lefties = [p for p in players if p[2] == 0]
    righties = [p for p in players if p[2] == 1]

    def count_teams(sorted_players):
        sorted_players.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end time
        result = 0
        for i, (_, end_time, _) in enumerate(sorted_players):
            count = sum(1 for start, _, _ in sorted_players if start <= end_time)
            if count >= k:
                result += comb(count - 1, k - 1)
        return result % MOD

    total_lefties = count_teams(lefties)
    total_righties = count_teams(righties)
    total_both = count_teams(players)

    # Subtract the cases where all players are either lefties or righties
    return (total_both - total_lefties - total_righties + MOD) % MOD

# Read input data
with open('fotbal.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    players = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Calculate result
teams_count = find_teams_count(n, k, players)

# Write output data
with open('fotbal.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(teams_count))
```

Now, the `count_teams` function correctly unpacks the start time, end time, and footedness for each player in `sorted_players`. The solution should now work correctly without the unpacking error and still respect the memory constraints while calculating the number of teams.
