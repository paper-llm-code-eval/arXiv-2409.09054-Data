Directorul unei școli dorește să premieze la sfârșitul anului școlar pe cei mai buni elevi la învățătură. Pentru acest lucru el are de rezolvat două probleme:

1. Să determine câți elevi vor fi premiați dintre cei $n$ elevi ai școlii. După discuții aprinse cu ceilalți profesori se hotărăște în Consiliul Profesoral ca numărul premianților să fie $n - k$, unde $k$ este cel mai mare număr pătrat perfect mai mic strict decât $n$. De exemplu, pentru $n = 150$, $k$ este $144$ (pentru că $144$ = $12^2$), deci vor fi premiați $150 - 144 = 6$ elevi.
2. Pentru a fi cât mai multă liniște la premiere, în Consiliul Profesoral se ia decizia ca elevii care nu vor fi premiați să fie așezați pe terenul de sport pe rânduri de câte $p$ elevi (unde $p^2 = k$). În acest scop, directorul a numerotat elevii nepremiați de la $1$ la $k$ și a hotărât ca elevii să fie așezați în ordinea descrescătoare a numerelor asociate.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește $n$, numărul de elevi din școală și calculează numărul de elevi premiați precum și modul de așezare a elevilor nepremiați.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `lascoala.in` va conține numărul $n$.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `lascoala.out` va conține pe prima linie numărul de elevi premiați, iar pe următoarele linii așezarea elevilor nepremiați.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 700$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate k (the greatest perfect square less than n)
k = int(np.floor(np.sqrt(n - 1)) ** 2)

# Calculate the number of awarded students
awarded_students = n - k

# Calculate the arrangement of the non-awarded students
p = int(np.sqrt(k))
arrangement = np.arange(k, 0, -1).reshape(p, p)

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{awarded_students}\n')
    for row in arrangement:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This solution should meet the criteria of being efficient in both time and memory usage, and it writes to `lascoala.out` as specified. The use of `numpy` helps to reduce the time complexity and manage the memory usage. However, if the use of numpy is still causing memory issues, a pure Python approach without numpy may be considered.

The error indicates that the numpy module is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. To fix the program and adhere to the memory constraints, we'll avoid using numpy and implement a pure Python solution instead.

Here's the fixed solution using pure Python:

```python
# Function to find the greatest perfect square less than n
def greatest_perfect_square(n):
    i = 1
    while (i+1) ** 2 < n:
        i += 1
    return i ** 2

# Read the input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate k (the greatest perfect square less than n)
k = greatest_perfect_square(n)

# Calculate the number of awarded students
awarded_students = n - k

# Calculate p (the square root of k)
p = int(k ** 0.5)

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{awarded_students}\n')
    for i in range(p, 0, -1):
        file.write(' '.join(str(j * p + i) for j in range(p-1, -1, -1)) + '\n')
```

This code should not use more memory than the given limit, as it does not create any large data structures and works with simple loops and arithmetic.

The difference between the expected and found output is due to the ordering of the non-awarded students. The output has the students arranged in columns of descending order from left to right, whereas the expected output needs rows of descending order from top to bottom.

To correct the output, I need to change the ordering of the numbers. Instead of iterating over each row and then each column, I need to iterate over the columns in the outer loop and the rows in the inner loop, effectively transposing the arrangement.

Here's the fixed and rewritten solution:

```python
# Function to find the greatest perfect square less than n
def greatest_perfect_square(n):
    i = 1
    while (i+1) ** 2 < n:
        i += 1
    return i ** 2

# Read the input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate k (the greatest perfect square less than n)
k = greatest_perfect_square(n)

# Calculate the number of awarded students
awarded_students = n - k

# Calculate p (the square root of k)
p = int(k ** 0.5)

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{awarded_students}\n')
    for i in range(p, 0, -1):
        row = [str(i + j*p) for j in range(p)]
        file.write(' '.join(row[::-1]) + '\n') # The row is reversed for descending order
```

The `[::-1]` slice operation reverses the list of numbers in each row so that they are in descending order, which should produce the correct result as per the expected output.

Upon reviewing the expected and found output, I recognize that I made a mistake in the arrangement logic in my previous solution. The expected output has rows in descending order from left to right, and then top to bottom. The found output has columns in descending order from top to bottom, which is not what was required.

To fix this, I need to iterate over each row and fill it with the corresponding descending numbers. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the greatest perfect square less than n
def greatest_perfect_square(n):
    i = 1
    while (i + 1) ** 2 < n:
        i += 1
    return i ** 2

# Read the input
with open('lascoala.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate k (the greatest perfect square less than n)
k = greatest_perfect_square(n)

# Calculate the number of awarded students
awarded_students = n - k

# Calculate p (the square root of k)
p = int(k ** 0.5)

# Write the output
with open('lascoala.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{awarded_students}\n')
    for row_start in range(k, 0, -p):
        row = ' '.join(str(row_start - i) for i in range(p))
        file.write(row + '\n')
```

This solution iterates over the starting number of each row (row_start), which is decremented by p each time to move to the next row. Within the row, we generate numbers in descending order starting from row_start and going down to row_start - p + 1. This should produce the expected output arrangement.
