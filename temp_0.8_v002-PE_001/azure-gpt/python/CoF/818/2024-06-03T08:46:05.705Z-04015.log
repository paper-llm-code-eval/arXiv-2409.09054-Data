Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

The error indicates that the numpy module is not available. Since the memory limit for this challenge is ~8MB and considering the Python environment restrictions, we should avoid using numpy or any other external libraries that are not part of the standard Python library. Therefore, I need to refactor the solution to use only built-in Python data structures and functions.

Here is the refactored solution without numpy:

```python
# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the necessary variables
total_money = sum(c)
order = []
last_cabin = 0

# Initialize the wheel with zero rotations for each cabin
wheel = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n)]  # First element for rotations, second for client index

# Function to find the minimum in terms of rotations and index in case of tie
def find_min_index(arr):
    min_index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):

            min_index = i
    return min_index

client_index = 1
for rotations in c:
    # Find the first available cabin or the one that will be available soonest
    min_index = find_min_index(wheel)
    # Add the client to the wheel
    wheel[min_index] = [wheel[min_index][0] + rotations, client_index]
    client_index += 1

# Process the remaining clients on the wheel

    min_index = find_min_index(wheel)
    if wheel[min_index][1] != 0:

        last_cabin = min_index + 1
    # The client has been processed, reset the cabin

The discrepancy is due to a logic error in processing the remaining clients on the wheel. The loop for processing the remaining clients is not managing the clients' rotations correctly. We need to simulate the wheel's rotation, decrementing the rotations for each client until their ride is complete, and then recording their order of disembarkation.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    client_rotations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the necessary variables
total_money = sum(client_rotations)
order = []
clients_in_cabins = [(0, 0)] * n  # Pair: (client number, remaining rotations)

# Load initial clients into the cabins
next_client = 1
for i in range(min(n, p)):
    clients_in_cabins[i] = (next_client, client_rotations[next_client - 1])
    next_client += 1

# Simulate the wheel's rotation
while next_client <= p or any(rotations > 0 for _, rotations in clients_in_cabins):
    # Rotate the wheel and disembark clients whose ride is over
    client_number, rotations_left = clients_in_cabins.pop(0)
    rotations_left -= 1
    if rotations_left == 0 and client_number > 0:
        order.append(client_number)
        # Check if there are more clients waiting to embark
        if next_client <= p:
            clients_in_cabins.append((next_client, client_rotations[next_client - 1]))
            next_client += 1
        else:
            clients_in_cabins.append((0, 0))
    else:
        clients_in_cabins.append((client_number, rotations_left))

# The last client to disembark determines the last cabin
last_cabin = (order[-1] - 1) % n + 1

# Write to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_money}\n{' '.join(map(str, order))}\n{last_cabin}\n")
```

This code has the following modifications:
1. The clients are loaded into the cabins, and we keep track of the next client to load.
2. We simulate the wheel's rotation by rotating the list of clients in the cabins.
3. When a client completes their rotations, they are removed from the wheel.
4. If there are more clients waiting, the next client is loaded onto the wheel.
5. We keep track of the order of disembarkation.
6. The last cabin number is determined by the position of the last client to disembark.

The error in the previous solution lies in incorrectly calculating the cabin number from which the last client disembarks. The calculation of the last cabin should take into account the current position of the wheel when the last client disembarks rather than just the last client's position in the order of disembarkation.

In order to correct this, we need to keep track of the position of the wheel (i.e., which cabin is at the embarking/disembarking point) after each complete rotation of the wheel and when the last client disembarks.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    client_rotations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the necessary variables
total_money = sum(client_rotations)
order = []
wheel = [(0, 0)] * n  # Each cabin initially holds no client and has zero rotations
next_client = 1
cabin_index = 0  # To keep track of the embarking/disembarking cabin position

# Load initial clients into the cabins
for i in range(min(n, p)):
    wheel[i] = (next_client, client_rotations[next_client - 1])
    next_client += 1

# While there are clients on the wheel
while next_client <= p or any(rotations for _, rotations in wheel):
    cabin_index = (cabin_index + 1) % n  # Rotate the wheel
    client, rotations_left = wheel[cabin_index]
    if rotations_left == 1:  # Client's ride is over
        order.append(client)
        # If there are more clients, load the next one into this cabin
        if next_client <= p:
            wheel[cabin_index] = (next_client, client_rotations[next_client - 1])
            next_client += 1
        else:  # No more clients, mark this cabin as empty
            wheel[cabin_index] = (0, 0)
    elif rotations_left > 1:  # Decrement the rotations left for this client
        wheel[cabin_index] = (client, rotations_left - 1)

# The last cabin is where the last client disembarked
last_cabin = (cabin_index + 1) % n + 1  # Adding 1 to convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed

# Write to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_money}\n{' '.join(map(str, order))}\n{last_cabin}\n")
```

The changes I've made are as follows:
1. Kept track of the current cabin index (`cabin_index`) which increments with each rotation of the wheel.
2. Updated the wheel's state correctly after each rotation, decrementing the rotations left for the current client or embarking the next client if the cabin becomes empty.
3. Correctly calculated the last cabin number based on the position of the wheel when the last client disembarks.

Upon reviewing the previous solution, I realize that there is an off-by-one error when determining the last cabin. When the last client disembarks, we should not increment the `cabin_index`, as the client disembarks before the next rotation. Therefore, the `cabin_index` at that point already points to the correct cabin.

Let's fix this issue and rewrite the solution.

```python
# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    client_rotations = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the necessary variables
total_money = sum(client_rotations)
order = []
wheel = [(0, 0)] * n  # Each cabin initially holds no client and has zero rotations
next_client = 1
cabin_index = -1  # Start at -1 because the first increment will move it to 0

# Load initial clients into the cabins
for i in range(min(n, p)):
    wheel[i] = (next_client, client_rotations[next_client - 1])
    next_client += 1

# While there are clients on the wheel
while any(rotations for _, rotations in wheel):
    # Rotate the wheel to the next cabin
    cabin_index = (cabin_index + 1) % n
    client, rotations_left = wheel[cabin_index]
    
    # If there is a client and their ride is over
    if client and rotations_left == 1:
        order.append(client)
        last_cabin = cabin_index + 1  # Convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed
        wheel[cabin_index] = (0, 0)  # Mark the cabin as empty
        
        # Load the next client into this cabin if available
        if next_client <= p:
            wheel[cabin_index] = (next_client, client_rotations[next_client - 1])
            next_client += 1
    elif rotations_left > 1:
        # Decrement rotations left
        wheel[cabin_index] = (client, rotations_left - 1)

# Write to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_money}\n{' '.join(map(str, order))}\n{last_cabin}\n")
```

This solution will correctly track the cabin index as the wheel rotates, and when the client disembarks, it will no longer increment the `cabin_index`. It should now produce the expected output.
