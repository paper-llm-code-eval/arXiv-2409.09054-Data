Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = np.array(file.readline().strip().split(), dtype=np.int64)

# Initialization
total_sum = np.sum(c)
customers_order = []
cabin_to_client = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.int64)
client_spins_remaining = np.zeros(p + 1, dtype=np.int64)
client_spins_remaining[1:] = c
clients_exited = 0
current_client = 1

# Main logic
while clients_exited < p:
    # Fill the cabins
    for i in range(n):
        if cabin_to_client[i] == 0 and current_client <= p:
            cabin_to_client[i] = current_client
            current_client += 1

    # Find the cabin with minimum spins remaining
    cabins_with_clients = cabin_to_client[cabin_to_client > 0]
    minimum_spins = np.min(client_spins_remaining[cabins_with_clients])
    
    # Decrease the number of spins for each customer in the cabins
    client_spins_remaining[cabins_with_clients] -= minimum_spins
    
    # Clients to exit
    clients_to_exit = np.where(client_spins_remaining[cabins_with_clients] == 0)[0]
    clients_exited += len(clients_to_exit)
    
    # Update the order of exiting clients
    for exit_idx in clients_to_exit:
        exit_client_number = cabins_with_clients[exit_idx]
        customers_order.append(str(exit_client_number))
        cabin_to_client[cabin_to_client == exit_client_number] = 0  # Empty the cabin

# Find the cabin where the last client exits
last_client_exit_cabin = np.where(cabin_to_client > 0)[0][0] + 1

# Write results to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(customers_order) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_client_exit_cabin}\n")
```

This solution reads the input from 'roata.in', performs the necessary calculations to find out the total amount collected, the order in which customers exit the wheel, and the cabin from which the last customer exits. The results are then written to 'roata.out'.

The solution uses NumPy for efficient array operations, which should help in maintaining a relatively low memory footprint and fast execution time. The code is designed to handle large inputs within the constraints mentioned in the problem statement.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment where the code is being run. Since the use of `numpy` is not possible, we must implement the solution without using any external libraries that aren't included in the standard Python distribution.

Below is the entire solution rewritten using only built-in Python functionality:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialization
total_sum = sum(c)
customers_order = []
cabin_to_client = [0] * n
client_spins_remaining = [0] + c
clients_exited = 0
current_client = 1

# Main logic
while clients_exited < p:
    # Fill the cabins
    for i in range(n):
        if cabin_to_client[i] == 0 and current_client <= p:
            cabin_to_client[i] = current_client
            current_client += 1

    # Find the cabin with minimum spins remaining
    minimum_spins = min([client_spins_remaining[c] for c in cabin_to_client if c > 0])

    # Decrease the number of spins for each customer in the cabins
    for idx, client_number in enumerate(cabin_to_client):
        if client_number > 0:
            client_spins_remaining[client_number] -= minimum_spins
            if client_spins_remaining[client_number] <= 0:
                clients_exited += 1
                customers_order.append(str(client_number))
                cabin_to_client[idx] = 0  # Empty the cabin

# Find the cabin where the last client exits
last_client_exit_cabin = (customers_order[-1] - 1) % n + 1

# Write results to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(customers_order) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_client_exit_cabin}\n")
```

This solution follows a similar logic to the earlier solution but does not rely on `numpy` or any other non-standard libraries. It uses lists and standard operations on lists to accomplish the same objectives. It reads input from `roata.in` and writes output to `roata.out` while conforming to the memory and time constraints specified.

The error message indicates a type error on line 36, where I'm trying to subtract an integer from a string. This is because `customers_order` is a list of strings, and I need to convert the string back to an integer before performing the arithmetic operations. Let's fix the issue and rewrite the entire solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialization
total_sum = sum(c)
customers_order = []
cabin_to_client = [0] * n
client_spins_remaining = [0] + c
clients_exited = 0
current_client = 1

# Main logic
while clients_exited < p:
    # Fill the cabins
    for i in range(n):
        if cabin_to_client[i] == 0 and current_client <= p:
            cabin_to_client[i] = current_client
            current_client += 1

    # Find the cabin with minimum spins remaining
    minimum_spins = min([client_spins_remaining[c] for c in cabin_to_client if c > 0])

    # Decrease the number of spins for each customer in the cabins
    for idx, client_number in enumerate(cabin_to_client):
        if client_number > 0:
            client_spins_remaining[client_number] -= minimum_spins
            if client_spins_remaining[client_number] <= 0:
                clients_exited += 1
                customers_order.append(client_number)  # Store as integer
                cabin_to_client[idx] = 0  # Empty the cabin

# Find the cabin where the last client exits
last_client_exit_cabin = (customers_order[-1] - 1) % n + 1

# Write results to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    # Convert customer order to strings when writing to file
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, customers_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_client_exit_cabin}\n")
```

This corrected version ensures that the `customers_order` list contains integers during processing and only converts them to strings when writing to the output file, avoiding a type mismatch. The program should now function correctly, respecting the input/output requirements and constraints specified in the problem.

The difference between the expected and found result is in the calculation of the cabin number from which the last client exits. In the current implementation, the cabin number is calculated directly from the last client's original position in the order array. However, this doesn't take into account the actual dynamics of the wheel's rotation.

We need to simulate the rotation of the wheel effectively to keep track of which cabin each client exits from. To fix this, let's adjust the algorithm so that we track the cabin number correctly while clients are exiting the wheel.

Let's rewrite the entire solution with necessary fixes:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialization
total_sum = sum(c)
customers_order = []
cabin_to_client = [0] * n
client_spins_remaining = [0] + c
clients_exited = 0
current_client = 1
current_cabin = 0

# Main logic loop
while clients_exited < p:
    # Check if the current cabin is empty or has a client whose ride is over
    if cabin_to_client[current_cabin] == 0 or client_spins_remaining[cabin_to_client[current_cabin]] == 0:
        if cabin_to_client[current_cabin] > 0:
            customers_order.append(cabin_to_client[current_cabin])
            clients_exited += 1
        
        # Fill the current cabin with the next client in line, if any
        if current_client <= p:
            cabin_to_client[current_cabin] = current_client
            current_client += 1
        else:
            cabin_to_client[current_cabin] = 0

    # Rotate the wheel to the next cabin in anti-clockwise direction
    current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n

    # Decrease the number of spins for each client by one
    for client_number in cabin_to_client:
        if client_number > 0:
            client_spins_remaining[client_number] -= 1

# Find the cabin where the last client exits
# (Since the wheel rotates in anti-clockwise direction, we take the last client's order
# number, subtract 1 to convert to 0-indexed, and subtract the remaining clients to
# find the correct cabin index)
last_client_exit_cabin = (customers_order[-1] - 1 - (p - len(customers_order))) % n + 1

# Write results to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, customers_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_client_exit_cabin}\n")
```

In this revised solution, we track the current cabin and decrement the spins remaining for each client as the wheel rotates. When a client's ride is over (i.e., `client_spins_remaining` reaches zero), we record their order number and continue the process until all clients have exited. Finally, we find the last client's exit cabin by considering the rotation of the wheel and the remaining clients who have yet to exit.

This fix should yield the correct output and match the expected result for the given input data.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was killed because it exceeded allowed memory usage or was terminated manually by a system administrator or a process manager. Since the standard error doesn't provide any specific messages about the cause, we can assume that our program may be using too much memory.

Looking at the code, we can see that it's not particularly memory-hungry. However, one potential issue could be the large list of `client_spins_remaining`. If the number of clients `p` is very high, this list could occupy more memory than allowed. Considering the input constraints ($1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$ and $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$), the worst-case memory usage can be quite high.

We need to optimize our solution to ensure that we are not storing unnecessary data and that we're efficiently using memory. In this case, we can do away with the list of spins remaining for each client by calculating the number of spins left on the fly.

Let's rewrite the entire solution with the necessary optimizations for better memory usage:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialization
total_sum = sum(c)
customers_order = []
cabin_to_client = [0] * n
current_client = 1
current_cabin = 0
clients_in_cabins = 0
spins_done = 0

# Main logic loop
while clients_in_cabins > 0 or current_client <= p:
    # Fill empty cabins with new clients
    while current_client <= p and clients_in_cabins < n:
        cabin_to_client[current_cabin] = current_client
        current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n
        current_client += 1
        clients_in_cabins += 1
    
    spins_done += 1
    
    # Clients whose rides are over exit the wheel
    exit_indices = []
    for i in range(n):
        if cabin_to_client[i] > 0 and spins_done == c[cabin_to_client[i] - 1]:
            customers_order.append(cabin_to_client[i])
            exit_indices.append(i)
    
    # Empty the cabins from which clients have exited
    for i in exit_indices:
        cabin_to_client[i] = 0
        clients_in_cabins -= 1

# Find the cabin where the last client exits
last_client_exit_cabin = (current_cabin - 1) % n + 1

# Write results to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, customers_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_client_exit_cabin}\n")
```

In this updated solution, we've removed the `client_spins_remaining` list and are instead keeping track of the total number of spins done (`spins_done`). This allows us to check if a client's ride is over by comparing `spins_done` with the client's initial number of purchased spins directly from the input list `c`. The optimization reduces memory usage significantly by not maintaining an additional list proportional to the number of clients `p`.

The exit code 137 indicates that the process has been killed, likely due to using too much memory. In the current environment, our program is exceeding the memory limit of ~8MB, which is causing the program to be forcibly terminated by the operating system or the execution environment.

The issue could be the way we're handling the logic that requires iterating over all clients and their spins. Our approach is not memory-efficient given the constraints.

To avoid overusing memory, we can use a more memory-efficient approach. We need an algorithm that processes one client at a time and doesn't keep track of all clients' spins in memory.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    spins = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialization
total_sum = sum(spins)
customers_order = []
cabin_customers = [0] * n
available_cabins = set(range(n))
current_spin = 0
last_cabin_index = 0

# Logic to process each client
for client_id in range(1, p + 1):
    if not available_cabins:
        current_spin += 1
        available_cabins = {i for i, customer in enumerate(cabin_customers) if spins[customer - 1] <= current_spin}
        for cabin in available_cabins:
            customers_order.append(cabin_customers[cabin])
            cabin_customers[cabin] = 0

    cabin_index = min(available_cabins)
    available_cabins.remove(cabin_index)
    cabin_customers[cabin_index] = client_id
    last_cabin_index = cabin_index

# Process remaining clients on the wheel
while any(cabin_customers):
    current_spin += 1
    for i, customer in enumerate(cabin_customers):
        if customer != 0 and spins[customer - 1] <= current_spin:
            customers_order.append(customer)
            cabin_customers[i] = 0

# Determine the cabin where the last client exits
last_client_exit_cabin = (last_cabin_index + 1) % n + 1

# Write results to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, customers_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_client_exit_cabin}\n")
```

This version of the solution processes the clients one at a time and rotates them on the wheel, adding them to the list of customers as their spins are completed. We increment the spin only when necessary (when cabins become available), and we keep track of which cabin each client was in, removing them from the wheel as their spins complete. This method ensures that we're not holding any more data in memory than is needed to solve the problem within the memory constraints.

This should resolve the excessive memory usage issue and avoid the program being killed with exit code 137.

---------- assistant ----------

The error message indicates that the program is attempting to call `min()` on an empty sequence, `available_cabins`. This happens because the code didn't handle the case where all clients have been assigned to cabins, and the wheel needs to be rotated (making some cabins available) before the next client can be assigned.

We can fix the program by ensuring that we always have available cabins before we attempt to find the minimum cabin index. If there are no available cabins, we'll rotate the wheel by incrementing the current spin count and updating the set of available cabins based on the clients' remaining spins.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    spins = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialization
total_sum = sum(spins)
customers_order = []  # To store the order of customers exiting the wheel
cabin_customers = [0] * n  # To store the customer ID for each cabin
available_cabins = set(range(n))  # Set of available cabins (starts with all cabins)
current_spin = 0  # Track the current spin number
last_cabin_index = 0  # To track the cabin index of the last customer

# Assign customers to cabins
for client_id in range(1, p + 1):
    # If there are no available cabins, rotate the wheel and make cabins available
    while not available_cabins:
        current_spin += 1
        for i, customer in enumerate(cabin_customers):
            if customer != 0 and spins[customer - 1] <= current_spin:
                customers_order.append(customer)
                cabin_customers[i] = 0
                available_cabins.add(i)

    # Assign the current client to the available cabin with the lowest index
    cabin_index = min(available_cabins)
    available_cabins.remove(cabin_index)
    cabin_customers[cabin_index] = client_id
    last_cabin_index = cabin_index

# After all customers have been assigned, rotate the wheel until all have exited
while any(cabin_customers):
    current_spin += 1
    for i, customer in enumerate(cabin_customers):
        if customer != 0 and spins[customer - 1] <= current_spin:
            customers_order.append(customer)
            cabin_customers[i] = 0

# Determine the cabin where the last customer exits
last_client_exit_cabin = (last_cabin_index + 1) % n + 1

# Write results to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, customers_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_client_exit_cabin}\n")
```

This solution processes the clients one at a time, ensuring that when all cabins are full, it rotates the wheel, frees up cabins with completed rides, and continues the assignment process. It eliminates the problem of calling `min()` on an empty sequence by checking for available cabins before assignment. This should resolve the ValueError and produce the desired output within the memory constraints.
