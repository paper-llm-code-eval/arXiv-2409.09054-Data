Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

    # Continue until all clients have taken all their rides
    while next_client_index < p or np.any(wheel):
        for i in range(n):
            # Disembark a client if needed
            if wheel[i] > 0:
                rides_left[wheel[i] - 1] -= 1
                if rides_left[wheel[i] - 1] == 0:
                    disembark_order.append(wheel[i])
                    wheel[i] = 0
            # Embark a client if the cabin is empty and there is a client waiting
            if wheel[i] == 0 and next_client_index < p:
                wheel[i] = clients_queue[next_client_index]
                next_client_index += 1
        total_sum += sum(rides[wheel - 1])
        position = (position + 1) % n

    # Cabin where the last client disembarks
    last_cabin = np.where(wheel == disembark_order[-1])[0][0] + 1
    return total_sum, disembark_order, last_cabin

# Read input data from file
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline())
    p = int(file.readline())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Run the simulation
total_sum, disembark_order, last_cabin = simulate_wheel(n, p, c)

# Write output data to file
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, disembark_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```
```
This solution uses numpy arrays to efficiently manage and update the state of the wheel, the queue of clients, and the number of rides left for each client. It also respects the memory constraints by avoiding unnecessary data structures and by using integer arrays. The output is written to `roata.out` as required.

This Python code should efficiently solve the problem, respecting the memory limits, and writing the results to 'roata.out'. It uses numpy arrays to handle the clients and their rides, as well as tracking the cabin states. It avoids unnecessary memory usage and iteratively simulates each of the rides on the wheel.

It seems the environment does not have the numpy library installed, and as per the problem constraints, the solution should be implemented without relying on external libraries like numpy. I will rewrite the solution using plain Python and built-in data structures to ensure compatibility.

```python
# Read input data from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline())
    p = int(file.readline())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the total sum collected
total_sum = sum(c)

# Initialize the wheel with zeros (empty cabins)
wheel = [0] * n
# Array to keep track of the rides each client has bought
rides_left = [0] * p
# List to store the order in which clients disembark
disembark_order = []

# Load the clients into the wheel
next_client = 0
for i in range(max(c) * n):
    cabin_index = i % n
    # If the cabin is empty and there are still clients waiting
    if wheel[cabin_index] == 0 and next_client < p:
        wheel[cabin_index] = next_client + 1
        rides_left[next_client] = c[next_client]
        next_client += 1
    # If the client has finished their rides
    if rides_left[wheel[cabin_index] - 1] == 1:
        disembark_order.append(wheel[cabin_index])
        last_cabin = cabin_index + 1
        wheel[cabin_index] = 0
    # Decrement the rides left for the client in the cabin
    if wheel[cabin_index] != 0:
        rides_left[wheel[cabin_index] - 1] -= 1

# Write output data to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, disembark_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```

This code does not use numpy or any other third-party libraries. It utilizes built-in Python lists to simulate the wheel and manage the clients' rides. The output is written to 'roata.out' as requested.

The issue with the previous implementation arises from the fact that it does not correctly handle the situation where the cabins are not immediately refilled after a client disembarks. It also continues to run for `max(c) * n` iterations, which is unnecessary and writes incorrect data for `disembark_order` by including zeroes for empty cabins.

I will rewrite the solution, ensuring that:
- Clients disembark only when their rides are finished.
- Cabins are immediately made available for new clients once they are empty.
- We stop the simulation when all clients have finished their rides.

Here is the updated solution:

```python
# Read input data from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline())
    p = int(file.readline())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the total sum collected
total_sum = sum(c)

# Initialize the wheel with None (empty cabins)
wheel = [None] * n
# List to store the order in which clients disembark
disembark_order = []
# Queue of clients waiting to board
client_queue = list(range(1, p + 1))
# Map to store the rides left for each client
client_rides = dict(zip(client_queue, c))
# Current cabin index for loading new clients
current_cabin_index = 0

# While we still have clients riding or waiting to ride
while client_queue or any(wheel):
    # Check each cabin on the wheel
    for i in range(n):
        # Disembark the client if their ride is over
        if wheel[i] is not None and client_rides[wheel[i]] == 1:
            disembark_order.append(wheel[i])
            wheel[i] = None
        # Decrement the ride count for the client in the cabin if it's not empty
        if wheel[i] is not None:
            client_rides[wheel[i]] -= 1
    
    # Load clients onto any empty cabins
    for i in range(n):
        if wheel[i] is None and client_queue:
            wheel[i] = client_queue.pop(0)
    
    # The cabin from which the last client will disembark
    last_cabin = (i + 1) if wheel[i] is not None else last_cabin

# Write output data to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, disembark_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```

This solution processes each cabin on each rotation, disembarking clients who have finished their rides and boarding new clients if there are any waiting. The loop continues until there are no more clients riding or waiting to ride. The number of the last cabin to disembark a client is captured correctly. The updated implementation should produce the expected result.

The previous implementation incorrectly calculates the last cabin from which the final client disembarks. The error occurs because it updates the last cabin index on every iteration rather than when a client actually disembarks. This results in setting the last_cabin to the current index, even if no client disembarks from that cabin.

To fix this, we should update the last_cabin index only when a client is disembarking. Further, the calculation of the last_cabin index should consider the rotation of the wheel. I'll apply this fix in the updated solution.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline())
    p = int(file.readline())
    ride_counts = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables
total_sum = sum(ride_counts)
clients = list(range(1, p + 1))
cabins = [0] * n
last_cabin = 0
disembark_order = []

# Track clients in cabins and remaining rides
current_client = 0
while current_client < p or any(c for c in cabins):
    # Load clients in empty cabins
    for i in range(n):
        if cabins[i] == 0 and current_client < p:
            cabins[i] = clients[current_client]
            current_client += 1
    
    # Rotate the wheel and update rides and disembark clients
    for i in range(n):
        if cabins[i] != 0:
            ride_counts[cabins[i] - 1] -= 1
            if ride_counts[cabins[i] - 1] == 0:
                disembark_order.append(cabins[i])
                last_cabin = i + 1  # Cabin indices are 1-based, not 0-based
                cabins[i] = 0

# Write output data to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, disembark_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```

The above code reads the input data, iterates through the process of simulating the wheel's operation by loading clients, rotating the wheel, and disembarking clients when their rides are complete. It correctly updates `last_cabin` only when a client disembarks. Finally, it writes the results to the 'roata.out' file according to the expected output format.
