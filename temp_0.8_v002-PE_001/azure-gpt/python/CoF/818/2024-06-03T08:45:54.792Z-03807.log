Una dintre atracţiile celebrului parc de distracţii Prater din Viena este Marea Roată Vieneză. Din ea se poate admira priveliştea întregii Viene.

Roata are $n$ cabine, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ în sens orar şi dispuse simetric pe circumferinţa roţii. Îmbarcarea clienţilor se face în cabina în care roata este tangentă cu solul, iar rotirea începe cu cabina $1$ aflată în poziţia de îmbarcare şi se face în sens antiorar. Un client plăteşte pentru o rotire $1$ EUR şi poate cumpăra un număr oarecare de rotiri.

Cei $p$ clienţi care doresc utilizarea roţii trebuie să respecte următoarea procedură: clientul cu numărul de ordine $i$ îşi cumpără un bilet pe care sunt înscrise numărul său de ordine şi numărul de rotiri $c_i$, apoi se aşează la rând. Când în poziţia de îmbarcare este o cabină liberă sau se eliberează o cabină, roata se opreşte şi urcă următorul clientul. Un client coboară după ce se efectuează numărul de rotiri înscris pe bilet.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care, cunoscând numărul $n$ de cabine al roţii, numărul $p$ de clienţi, precum şi numărul de rotiri cumpărate de fiecare client, $c_i$, să calculeze:

* suma totală încasată de administratorul roţii de la clienţi;
* ordinea în care coboară clienţii din roată;
* numărul cabinei din care coboară ultimul client.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `roata.in` conţine pe primul rând numărul natural $n$, pe al doilea rând numărul natural $p$ iar pe al treilea rând numerele naturale $c_i$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţiile de mai sus.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `roata.out` va conţine pe prima linie suma totală încasată, pe a doua linie numerele de ordine ale clienţilor, în ordinea coborârii, separate printr-un spaţiu, iar pe a treia linie numărul cabinei din care va coborî ultimul client.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n \leq 360$;
* $1 \leq p \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \ 000$;
* pentru rezolvarea primei cerinţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru celelalte două cerinţe se acordă câte $40\%$ din punctaj fiecare.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Code to solve the problem described in the challenge
import numpy as np

# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = np.fromstring(file.readline().strip(), dtype=int, sep=' ')

# Initialize necessary data structures
clients = np.zeros((p, 2), dtype=int)  # Store client number and remaining rides
clients[:, 0] = np.arange(1, p+1)  # Client number
clients[:, 1] = c  # Remaining rides
total_income = clients[:, 1].sum()  # Sum of all rides bought
wheel = np.zeros(n, dtype=int)  # The cabins on the wheel
client_order = []  # Order in which clients leave

# Simulate the wheel's operation
client_index = 0  # Index of the next client to board
rounds = 0  # Counter for wheel rotations
while client_index < p or np.any(wheel > 0):  # While there are clients or rides
    rounds += 1  # Increment wheel rotations
    disembark_index = rounds % n  # Cabin index where clients disembark
    if wheel[disembark_index] > 0:  # If a client is set to disembark
        client_order.append(wheel[disembark_index])  # Record disembarking client
        wheel[disembark_index] = 0  # Empty the cabin
    if client_index < p:  # If there are still clients waiting to board
        boarding_cabin = (disembark_index + 1) % n
        if wheel[boarding_cabin] == 0:  # If the next cabin is empty
            wheel[boarding_cabin] = clients[client_index, 0]  # Board client
            client_index += 1  # Move to the next client
    wheel[wheel > 0] -= 1  # Decrement remaining rides for all boarded clients

# Determine the cabin from which the last client disembarks
last_cabin = (rounds + n - 1) % n + 1

# Write to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_income}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, client_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```

This solution uses numpy to handle large arrays efficiently and to perform vectorized operations, which are generally faster than their pure Python counterparts. The code reads the input from `roata.in`, performs the simulation, and writes the output to `roata.out`, as required.

I apologize for the confusion; it seems that the environment where this code is to be run does not have the `numpy` library installed. Given the constraints, I will rewrite the solution to avoid using any external libraries and to ensure it remains within the memory limits.

Here is the revised solution in Python using only built-in libraries:

```python
# Code to solve the problem described in the challenge

# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize necessary data structures
total_income = sum(c)
wheel = [0] * n
client_order = []
boarding_clients = [(i + 1, c[i]) for i in range(p)]

# Simulate the wheel's operation
client_index = 0  # Index of the next client to board
rounds = 0  # Counter for wheel rotations
while client_index < p or any(wheel):
    disembark_index = rounds % n  # Cabin index where clients disembark
    if wheel[disembark_index]:
        client_order.append(wheel[disembark_index])
        wheel[disembark_index] = 0
    while client_index < p and wheel[(disembark_index + 1) % n] == 0:
        boarding_cabin = (disembark_index + 1) % n
        client, rides = boarding_clients[client_index]
        wheel[boarding_cabin] = client
        client_index += 1
        for i in range(n):
            if wheel[i]:
                wheel[i] -= rides
                break  # Important to only decrement once
    rounds += 1

# Determine the cabin from which the last client disembarks
last_cabin = (rounds - 1) % n + 1

# Write to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_income}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, client_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```

This solution does not use `numpy` and should compile and run correctly, respecting the memory limits. It reads the input from `roata.in` and writes the output to `roata.out`, following the problem constraints and requirements.

After reviewing the provided solution and the expected output, it's clear that there's an issue with how the clients are being processed and how the rides are being decremented. The logic is flawed, as it incorrectly decrements the ride count for all clients in the wheel for each client's boarding rides. Another issue is that the cabin number should be incremented by 1 to match the input data, which uses 1-based indexing for the cabins.

Let's fix the algorithm with an approach that processes each client correctly:

1. Initialize data structures for the wheel, the clients, and the record of income.
2. Simulate the wheel's operation:
   - Board clients into available cabins.
   - Rotate the wheel to simulate the passage of time (rides).
   - Record when clients disembark.
3. Calculate the cabin number from which the last client disembarks.

Here is the corrected and simplified solution:

```python
# Code to solve the problem described in the challenge

# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize necessary data structures
total_income = sum(c)  # Sum of all rides bought
wheel = [0] * n  # The cabins on the wheel
client_order = []  # Order in which clients leave
next_client_index = 0  # Index of the next client to board
client_remaining_rides = [0] * (p + 1)  # List to store remaining rides for each client

# Simulate the wheel's operation
for i in range(1, p + 1):
    client_remaining_rides[i] = c[i - 1]  # Set remaining rides for each client

rounds = 0
while next_client_index < p or any(client_remaining_rides):
    cabin_to_disembark = rounds % n
    if wheel[cabin_to_disembark] > 0:  # Client disembarks
        client_order.append(wheel[cabin_to_disembark])  # Add to client order
        client_remaining_rides[wheel[cabin_to_disembark]] = 0  # Set remaining rides to 0
        wheel[cabin_to_disembark] = 0  # Clear the cabin
    
    while next_client_index < p and wheel[cabin_to_disembark] == 0:
        next_client_index += 1
        wheel[cabin_to_disembark] = next_client_index  # Client boards
        cabin_to_disembark = (cabin_to_disembark + 1) % n  # Move to next cabin
    
    # Decrease remaining rides for all clients on the wheel
    for i in range(n):
        if wheel[i] > 0:
            client_remaining_rides[wheel[i]] -= 1

    rounds += 1  # Increment the total number of rounds

# Determine the cabin from which the last client disembarks
last_cabin = (rounds - 1) % n + 1  # +1 to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing

# Write to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_income}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, client_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```

This solution ensures that clients are processed in the correct order, their remaining rides are tracked accurately, and they disembark properly. It also aligns with the constraints of 1-based cabin numbering. The output should now match the expected result.

Upon reviewing the corrected solution, it seems that the algorithm is still not properly simulating the wheel's operation. Specifically, it is not accounting for the variable number of rides each client has purchased when they disembark, and it's not boarding the next client correctly after one disembarks.

Let's revise the algorithm to fix these issues:

1. Use a queue to manage the clients waiting to board the wheel.
2. For each cabin, keep track of the client number and the remaining rides for that client.
3. Every time the wheel rotates, reduce the number of remaining rides for the client in the departing cabin.
4. Disembark the client when their rides reach zero and then board the next client from the queue.

Here's the re-implemented solution:

```python
# Code to solve the problem described in the challenge

# Read from 'roata.in'
with open('roata.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    c = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize necessary data structures
total_income = sum(c)  # Sum of all rides bought
wheel = [(0, 0)] * n  # Tuples of (client number, remaining rides)
client_order = []  # Order in which clients leave
queue = [(i + 1, c[i]) for i in range(p)]  # Queue of clients with their rides

# Simulate the wheel's operation
current_cabin = 0
while queue or any(rides for _, rides in wheel):
    # Disembark the client if they have finished their rides
    client, rides = wheel[current_cabin]
    if rides == 1 and client != 0:
        client_order.append(client)
        wheel[current_cabin] = (0, 0)
    elif rides > 1:
        wheel[current_cabin] = (client, rides - 1)

    # Board the next client if the cabin is empty and there's a client in queue
    if wheel[current_cabin] == (0, 0) and queue:
        wheel[current_cabin] = queue.pop(0)

    # Move to the next cabin
    current_cabin = (current_cabin + 1) % n

# Determine the cabin from which the last client disembarks
last_cabin = (current_cabin - 1 + n) % n + 1  # Convert to 1-based indexing

# Write to 'roata.out'
with open('roata.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_income}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, client_order)) + '\n')
    file.write(f"{last_cabin}\n")
```

This solution uses a queue to manage clients waiting to board, and updates the state of the wheel correctly after each rotation. It also correctly disembarks clients when their rides are finished and boards new clients into the now-empty cabins. The last cabin number is calculated correctly by considering the last cabin visited and adjusting for 1-based indexing. This should produce the expected output.
