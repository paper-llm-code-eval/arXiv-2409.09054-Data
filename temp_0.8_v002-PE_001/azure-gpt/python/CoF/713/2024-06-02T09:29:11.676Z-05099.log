Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `exponent.in` and write to `exponent.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un număr natural $n$ și o cifră $k$ din mulțimea $\{2, 3, 5, 7\}$.

# Cerință

Se cere să se afișeze exponentul lui $k$ în descompunerea în factori primi a produsului $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `exponent.in` conține pe prima linie $n$ și $k$.


# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `exponent.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural, adică exponentul cerut de problemă.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $k = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$;

Example:
`exponent.in`
```
6 3
```

`exponent.out`
```
2

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input data from 'exponent.in'
with open('exponent.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the result
result = 0

# Calculate the exponent of prime k in the factorial of n
i = k
while i <= n:
    result += n // i
    i *= k

# Write the result to 'exponent.out'
with open('exponent.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```
```

This script calculates the exponent of a prime number `k` in the factorial of `n` by counting how many multiples of `k`, `k^2`, `k^3`, etc., fit into `n`. This is more efficient than calculating the factorial and then counting the prime factors, which would be infeasible due to the memory constraints. The script uses file operations for reading from and writing to files as required.

Expected program to write result to `exponent.out` and read from `exponent.in`.
Do not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

import numpy as np

def calculate_exponent(n, k):
    # Initialize the exponent result
    exponent = 0
    # Loop to find the exponent of k in n!
    while n > 0:
        n //= k
        exponent += n
    return exponent

# Read the input data from 'exponent.in'
with open('exponent.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the exponent
result = calculate_exponent(n, k)

# Write the output to 'exponent.out'

The error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'" indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the script is being executed. Since the use of `numpy` is actually not necessary for this problem, we can simply remove the import statement and proceed without it. Here is the revised solution without the `numpy` import:

```python
# Efficient solution to calculate the exponent of k in the prime factorization of n!

def calculate_exponent(n, k):
    # Initialize the exponent result
    exponent = 0
    # Loop to find the exponent of k in n!
    while n > 0:
        n //= k
        exponent += n
    return exponent

# Read the input data from 'exponent.in'
with open('exponent.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the exponent
result = calculate_exponent(n, k)

# Write the output to 'exponent.out'
with open('exponent.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```
