Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `exponent.in` and write to `exponent.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un număr natural $n$ și o cifră $k$ din mulțimea $\{2, 3, 5, 7\}$.

# Cerință

Se cere să se afișeze exponentul lui $k$ în descompunerea în factori primi a produsului $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `exponent.in` conține pe prima linie $n$ și $k$.


# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `exponent.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural, adică exponentul cerut de problemă.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* $k = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$;

Example:
`exponent.in`
```
6 3

`exponent.out`
```
2

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Efficient function to calculate the exponent of k in factorial of n
def calculate_exponent(n, k):
    exponent = 0
    while n > 0:
        n //= k
        exponent += n
    return exponent

# Read from exponent.in
with open('exponent.in', 'r') as f:
    n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Calculate exponent
result = calculate_exponent(n, k)

# Write to exponent.out
with open('exponent.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result))
```
```

This solution reads the numbers n and k from the file `exponent.in`, then calculates the exponent of the prime k in the factorization of n! (the factorial of n) without computing the factorial itself, which would be inefficient and memory-consuming. It writes the result to the file `exponent.out`. The function `calculate_exponent` repeatedly divides n by k and adds the quotient to the exponent, which gives the correct exponent in the prime factorization. This approach avoids large numbers and excessive memory usage, suitable for the given constraints.

Expected program to write result to `exponent.out` and read from `exponent.in`.
Do not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The error occurs because the program attempted to import the `numpy` module, which is not necessary for the solution and is not available in the execution environment. Given the memory constraints and the nature of the problem, we don't actually need `numpy` at all. I'll remove the import statement and rewrite the solution accordingly.

```python
# Function to calculate exponent of prime k in the factorization of n factorial
def calculate_exponent(n, k):
    exponent = 0
    while n:
        n //= k
        exponent += n
    return exponent

# Reading from the file exponent.in
with open('exponent.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculating the exponent
exponent = calculate_exponent(n, k)

# Writing to the file exponent.out
with open('exponent.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(exponent))
```
