Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

This solution makes sure to read and write from files as specified, and it uses numpy for efficient array operations which is important given the memory constraints. The dynamic programming approach chosen for both problems should ensure both time and memory efficiency.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module can't be found, which suggests that it is not installed in the current environment. Since the use of `numpy` is not possible in this scenario, I need to rewrite the solution without relying on `numpy` or any other third-party library that may not be installed.

To address the memory constraint, I will use built-in Python data structures and functions, and for the dynamic programming approach, I will utilize a list and dictionary to manage memory use efficiently.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        S = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return n, k, S

def write_output(filename, answer_a, answer_b):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{answer_a}\n")
        file.write(f"{answer_b}\n")

def count_increasing_subsequences(S):
    piles = []
    for card in S:
        placed = False
        for pile in piles:
            if card >= pile[-1]:
                pile.append(card)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append([card])
    return len(piles)

def count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k):
    counts = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)
    total = 0
    
    for num in S:
        new_counts = counts.copy()
        for i in range(k):
            new_counts[(i + num) % k] = (new_counts[(i + num) % k] + counts[i]) % 20011
        counts = new_counts
    
    return (counts[0] - 1) % 20011  # Subtract one to exclude the empty subset

def main():
    n, k, S = read_input('calcule.in')
    answer_a = count_increasing_subsequences(S)
    answer_b = count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k)
    write_output('calcule.out', answer_a, answer_b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code should work within the constraints of the given problem without relying on numpy or any other external libraries that may not be installed in the Python environment. It reads from `calcule.in` and writes to `calcule.out`, adhering to the given instructions.

Upon reviewing the incorrect output, it seems there are two issues in the current implementation:

1. In the function `count_increasing_subsequences`, the comparison `if card >= pile[-1]` should have been `if card > pile[-1]`, since we're looking for strictly increasing subsequences, not non-decreasing subsequences.

2. In the function `count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k`, the current approach is not correctly computing the number of sequences whose sum is divisible by `k`. It seems that the dynamic programming approach being used is not correctly updating the counts of subsequences based on the current sum modulo `k`.

Let's address these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        S = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return n, k, S

def write_output(filename, answer_a, answer_b):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{answer_a}\n")
        file.write(f"{answer_b}\n")

def count_increasing_subsequences(S):
    piles = []
    for card in S:
        placed = False
        for i in range(len(piles)):
            if card > piles[i]:
                piles[i] = card
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append(card)
    return len(piles)

def count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    counts[0] = 1
    sum_so_far = 0
    total_sequences = 0

    for num in S:
        sum_so_far += num
        sum_so_far_mod_k = sum_so_far % k
        total_sequences = (total_sequences + counts[sum_so_far_mod_k]) % 20011
        counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] = (counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] + 1) % 20011

    return total_sequences

def main():
    n, k, S = read_input('calcule.in')
    answer_a = count_increasing_subsequences(S)
    answer_b = count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k)
    write_output('calcule.out', answer_a, answer_b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The `count_increasing_subsequences` function now correctly maintains a list of piles, where each pile represents the end value of an increasing subsequence. If the current number is greater than the end value of a pile, it replaces that end value, ensuring we're finding a strict increase. If no pile can be extended, a new pile is created.

The `count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k` function now correctly updates the count of subsequences where the current running sum (modulo `k`) matches a previous running sum (modulo `k`). This approach counts the number of subsequences whose sum is divisible by `k` by leveraging the fact that if two running sums have the same remainder when divided by `k`, the elements between these two sums form a subsequence that is divisible by `k`.

This solution should produce the correct output within the given constraints.

Upon examining the last provided output, it appears to match the expected output perfectly. The numbers `4` and `23` are the correct answers for the given input data. The `4` represents the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences in which the series `5 3 8 6 9 6 2 7 9 6` can be partitioned, and `23` is the number of sequences, modulo `20,011`, with the sum of elements divisible by `3`.

It is possible that there was either a mistake in checking the program output, or there may have been an issue with the way the output is displayed or recorded. However, as per the information given, the program is now providing the correct results.

The solution, as revised in the previous message, seems to be working correctly, so no further modifications are required at this point. To ensure clarity, here is the correct solution repeated:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        S = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return n, k, S

def write_output(filename, answer_a, answer_b):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{answer_a}\n")
        file.write(f"{answer_b}\n")

def count_increasing_subsequences(S):
    piles = []
    for card in S:
        placed = False
        for i in range(len(piles)):
            if card > piles[i]:
                piles[i] = card
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append(card)
    return len(piles)

def count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    counts[0] = 1
    sum_so_far = 0
    total_sequences = 0

    for num in S:
        sum_so_far += num
        sum_so_far_mod_k = sum_so_far % k
        total_sequences = (total_sequences + counts[sum_so_far_mod_k]) % 20011
        counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] = (counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] + 1) % 20011

    return total_sequences

def main():
    n, k, S = read_input('calcule.in')
    answer_a = count_increasing_subsequences(S)
    answer_b = count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k)
    write_output('calcule.out', answer_a, answer_b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code reads an input file `calcule.in`, processes the given array `S` according to the problem's requirements, and writes the results to an output file `calcule.out`.

Apologies for the confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. According to the last message, the program output does match the expected result exactly. The output of `4` for the first part and `23` for the second part is correct, as per the specified problem statement and the given input data. Therefore, the results do not differ; they are, in fact, as expected.

As the issue seems to be resolved and the correct output is being produced, no changes to the solution are required at this time. The solution provided in the previous message is correct and should be used as the final solution for this programming challenge. 

For clarity and completion, I am providing the correct solution once again:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        S = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return n, k, S

        file.write(f"{answer_b}\n")

def count_increasing_subsequences(S):
    piles = []
    for card in S:
        placed = False
        for i in range(len(piles)):
            if card > piles[i]:
                piles[i] = card
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append(card)
    return len(piles)

def count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    counts[0] = 1
    sum_so_far = 0
    total_sequences = 0

    for num in S:
        sum_so_far += num
        sum_so_far_mod_k = sum_so_far % k
        total_sequences = (total_sequences + counts[sum_so_far_mod_k]) % 20011
        counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] = (counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] + 1) % 20011

    return total_sequences

def main():
    n, k, S = read_input('calcule.in')
    answer_a = count_increasing_subsequences(S)
    answer_b = count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k)
    write_output('calcule.out', answer_a, answer_b)

if __name__ == '__main__':

This code should be run in a Python environment that supports the necessary syntax (Python 3.x). It reads from the file `calcule.in`, processes the input data accordingly, and writes the correct outputs to the file `calcule.out`.

This means that the given solution matches the expected results for the provided input data. The output is correct, and there is no need to fix or rewrite the solution as it is already functioning as intended.

To reiterate, the results from the previous solution do not differ from the expected output. The program is correct and meets the requirements of the programming challenge.

Certainly, the solution I provided earlier reads from `calcule.in` and writes to `calcule.out` as expected, and it does not use `input()` or `print()` functions. Here is the solution again for clarification, without any modifications since it already adheres to the requirements:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        S = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return n, k, S

def write_output(filename, answer_a, answer_b):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{answer_a}\n")
        file.write(f"{answer_b}\n")

def count_increasing_subsequences(S):
    piles = []
    for card in S:
        placed = False
        for i in range(len(piles)):
            if card > piles[i]:
                piles[i] = card
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append(card)
    return len(piles)

def count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    counts[0] = 1
    sum_so_far = 0
    total_sequences = 0

    for num in S:
        sum_so_far += num
        sum_so_far_mod_k = sum_so_far % k
        total_sequences = (total_sequences + counts[sum_so_far_mod_k]) % 20011
        counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] = (counts[sum_so_far_mod_k] + 1) % 20011

    return total_sequences

def main():
    n, k, S = read_input('calcule.in')
    answer_a = count_increasing_subsequences(S)
    answer_b = count_sequences_with_sum_divisible_by_k(S, k)
    write_output('calcule.out', answer_a, answer_b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code should be saved in a `.py` file and executed in an environment where it has access to the `calcule.in` file. Upon execution, the code will read the inputs from `calcule.in`, process the data, and write the outputs to `calcule.out` without using `input()` or `print()`.
