Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

import numpy as np

def calculate_subsequences(s):
    # We will use patience sorting principle to find the minimum number of increasing subsequences

    total_count = 0

    for num in s:

        for i in range(k):
            new_mod_count[(i + num) % k] += mod_count[i]
            new_mod_count[(i + num) % k] %= 20011
        mod_count = new_mod_count
        total_count += mod_count[0]
        total_count %= 20011

    return total_count

# Read the input file

    n, k = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
    s = list(map(int, f_in.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers
a_answer = calculate_subsequences(s)
b_answer = calculate_sequences(s, k)

# Write the output file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(str(a_answer) + '\n')
    f_out.write(str(b_answer) + '\n')
```

This Python solution reads from `calcule.in`, processes the inputs to find the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences and the number of sequences with sum divisible by `k`, and writes the results to `calcule.out`.

The `calculate_subsequences()` function uses the patience sorting principle to find the number of piles (increasing subsequences) needed. 

The `calculate_sequences()` function uses dynamic programming to count the sequences with sum divisible by `k`. We maintain a mod_count array to keep track of the count of sequences with a particular sum modulo `k`.

The solution optimizes for both time and memory, using numpy arrays for efficient memory use and operations. The input size constraints are taken into account to ensure that we stay within the specified memory limit.

The error is indicating that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the use of `numpy` is a key part of the initial solution for optimizing memory usage, and considering that the problem requires highly efficient libraries, this presents a challenge.

However, given the error and the constraints, we may need to implement a solution that does not rely on external libraries such as `numpy`. We can use pure Python to solve the problem. Here is a revised solution which uses built-in data types and functions to solve the problem efficiently:

```python
def calculate_subsequences(s):
    piles = []
    for num in s:
        placed = False
        for pile in piles:
            if pile[-1] >= num:
                pile.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append([num])
    return len(piles)

def calculate_sequences(s, k):
    mod_count = [0] * k
    mod_count[0] = 1
    total_count = 0

    for num in s:
        new_mod_count = mod_count[:]  # copy of current state
        for i in range(k):
            new_mod_count[(i + num) % k] += mod_count[i]
            new_mod_count[(i + num) % k] %= 20011
        mod_count = new_mod_count
        total_count += mod_count[0]
        total_count %= 20011

    return total_count

# Read the input file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as f_in:
    n, k = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
    s = list(map(int, f_in.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers
a_answer = calculate_subsequences(s)
b_answer = calculate_sequences(s, k)

# Write the output file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(str(a_answer) + '\n')
    f_out.write(str(b_answer) + '\n')
```

This implementation should work within the memory constraints, as it uses only Python lists, which are more memory-efficient than numpy arrays in small sizes. The computation is still done in an efficient manner, making it a suitable solution for the challenge.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it appears that the function `calculate_sequences` has an issue in counting the sequences with the sum divisible by `k`. The algorithm incorrectly counts overlapping sequences multiple times. We need to adjust it to count only non-overlapping consecutive sequences.

We can fix this by using a running sum and counting how many times each modulus of the running sum has appeared before. This will give us the count of subarrays ending at the current position with sum divisible by `k`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_subsequences(s):
    # Strategy: Use patience sorting principle to find the minimum increasing subsequences
    tails = []
    for num in s:
        # Find the first pile where we can put the current number
        index = next((i for i, tail in enumerate(tails) if tail >= num), None)
        if index is not None:
            tails[index] = num   # Replace the tail with the current number
        else:
            tails.append(num)    # Create a new pile
    return len(tails)

def calculate_sequences(s, k):
    # Strategy: Use a running sum and count occurrences of each modulus
    running_sum = 0
    mod_count = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)  # mod_count[0] starts at 1 for the empty subarray
    total_count = 0

    for num in s:
        running_sum = (running_sum + num) % k
        total_count = (total_count + mod_count[running_sum]) % 20011
        mod_count[running_sum] += 1

    return total_count

# Read the input file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as f_in:
    n, k = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
    s = list(map(int, f_in.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers
a_answer = calculate_subsequences(s)
b_answer = calculate_sequences(s, k)

# Write the output file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(str(a_answer) + '\n')
    f_out.write(str(b_answer) + '\n')
```

With this fix, `calculate_sequences` now correctly counts the number of non-overlapping consecutive sequences with sums divisible by `k` by using a running sum and a frequency count of seen moduli. This fix should produce the expected output for the given input and meet the memory constraints without using additional libraries.

Upon reviewing the message, it seems there might have been a mistake in the evaluation, as the expected output and the found output in the last message are identical:

Expected output:
```
4 
23
```

Found output:
```
4
23
```

This suggests that the revised solution provided in the previous message is correct and matches the expected result. The algorithm for calculating the number of increasing subsequences appears to be correctly implemented.

Similarly, the algorithm for computing the number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k` has been fixed and should now correctly count the non-overlapping sequences with the desired property.

Therefore, no further changes are necessary to the code provided in the previous message. It should produce the correct output for the given input, and we can consider the problem solved. 

Here is the correct and final solution, which is the same as the one provided in the previous message:

```python
def calculate_subsequences(s):
    # Strategy: Use patience sorting principle to find the minimum increasing subsequences
    tails = []
    for num in s:
        # Find the first pile where we can put the current number
        index = next((i for i, tail in enumerate(tails) if tail >= num), None)
        if index is not None:
            tails[index] = num   # Replace the tail with the current number
        else:
            tails.append(num)    # Create a new pile
    return len(tails)

def calculate_sequences(s, k):
    # Strategy: Use a running sum and count occurrences of each modulus
    running_sum = 0
    mod_count = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)  # mod_count[0] starts at 1 for the empty subarray
    total_count = 0

    for num in s:
        running_sum = (running_sum + num) % k
        total_count = (total_count + mod_count[running_sum]) % 20011
        mod_count[running_sum] += 1

    return total_count

# Read the input file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as f_in:
    n, k = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
    s = list(map(int, f_in.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers
a_answer = calculate_subsequences(s)
b_answer = calculate_sequences(s, k)

# Write the output file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(str(a_answer) + '\n')
    f_out.write(str(b_answer) + '\n')
```

This code should be used to solve the problem as it stands correct according to the last evaluation message.

It appears there was an error in the communication of the program results. The found output and the expected output provided in your last message are the same. Therefore, the code provided in the previous answer should be correct and does not need any further fixes. Here it is again for reference:

```python
def calculate_subsequences(s):
    # Strategy: Use patience sorting principle to find the minimum increasing subsequences
    tails = []
    for num in s:
        # Find the first pile where we can put the current number
        index = next((i for i, tail in enumerate(tails) if tail >= num), None)
        if index is not None:
            tails[index] = num   # Replace the tail with the current number
        else:
            tails.append(num)    # Create a new pile
    return len(tails)

def calculate_sequences(s, k):
    # Strategy: Use a running sum and count occurrences of each modulus
    running_sum = 0
    mod_count = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)  # mod_count[0] starts at 1 for the empty subarray
    total_count = 0

    for num in s:
        running_sum = (running_sum + num) % k
        total_count = (total_count + mod_count[running_sum]) % 20011
        mod_count[running_sum] += 1

    return total_count

# Read the input file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as f_in:
    n, k = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
    s = list(map(int, f_in.readline().split()))

# Calculate the answers
a_answer = calculate_subsequences(s)
b_answer = calculate_sequences(s, k)

# Write the output file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(str(a_answer) + '\n')
    f_out.write(str(b_answer) + '\n')
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum number of increasing subsequences and the number of sequences with a sum divisible by `k`, writing the answers to `calcule.out`. Since the found output matches the expected output, there is no discrepancy, and the solution is valid.

Given that the expected and found outputs match exactly, the program result does indeed match the expected result. This means the provided solution is correct and functioning as expected for the given input. There is no discrepancy to evaluate, and no bug to fix in the solution. The program is producing the correct output, and thus no rewrite of the solution is necessary.

To reiterate, the solution that has been provided in the previous response is correct and does not require any changes. It can be used to solve the problem as stated.

I understand now. The provided solution already meets the requirements of writing to `calcule.out` and reading from `calcule.in` without using `input()` or `print()`. Based on the last clarification, the outputs match and the solution is correct. However, if there is still an issue or confusion, I am providing the correct solution once again, ensuring that all requirements are met:

```python
# Read the input file
with open('calcule.in', 'r') as f_in:
    n, k = map(int, f_in.readline().split())
    s = list(map(int, f_in.readline().split()))

# Function to calculate the minimum number of increasing subsequences
def calculate_subsequences(s):
    piles = []
    for num in s:
        placed = False
        for pile in piles:
            if pile[-1] >= num:
                pile.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            piles.append([num])
    return len(piles)

# Function to calculate the number of sequences with the sum divisible by k
def calculate_sequences(s, k):
    mod_count = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)
    total_count = 0
    running_sum = 0

    for num in s:
        running_sum = (running_sum + num) % k
        total_count = (total_count + mod_count[running_sum]) % 20011
        mod_count[running_sum] += 1

    return total_count

# Calculate the answers
a_answer = calculate_subsequences(s)
b_answer = calculate_sequences(s, k)

# Write the output file
with open('calcule.out', 'w') as f_out:
    f_out.write(str(a_answer) + '\n')
    f_out.write(str(b_answer) + '\n')
```

This code should be executed as a single Python script. It does not use `input()` or `print()`, and it correctly reads from `calcule.in` and writes to `calcule.out`.
