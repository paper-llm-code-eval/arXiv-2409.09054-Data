Gigel a studiat recent şirurile cu $n$ elemente, numere naturale. Pentru un astfel de şir $S$, Gigel doreşte să afle răspunsul la întrebările:

$a)$ Care este numărul minim de subşiruri strict crescătoare în care se poate partiţiona $S$?
$b)$ Care este numărul de secvenţe, modulo $20 \ 011$, cu suma elementelor divizibilă cu $k$ care se pot obţine din $S$?

# Cerinţa


Dându-se un şir $S$ cu $n$ elemente numere naturale şi un număr natural $k$ se cere să se răspundă la cele două întrebări. 


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `calcule.in` se află valorile naturale $n$ şi $k$ separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe următoarea linie se află cele $n$ elemente ale şirului $S$, numere naturale separate prin câte un spaţiu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `calcule.out` va conţine două linii, pe prima linie fiind scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $a)$, iar pe a doua, un număr natural  reprezentând răspunsul la întrebarea $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n < 100 \ 000$
* $S$ are elemente mai mici sau egale cu $20 \ 000$.
* $k < 50 \ 000$, $k <  n$
* Un **subşir** al şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente din $S$ **în ordinea** în care sunt în $S$, dar **nu obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive, iar o **secvenţă** a şirului $S$ se obţine selectând elemente în ordinea în care sunt în $S$, dar **obligatoriu** de pe poziţii consecutive. Se admit şi secvenţe sau subşiruri cu un singur element.
* Pentru $50\%$ din teste $k < 10 \ 000$
* Pentru răspuns corect la o singură cerinţă se acordă $50\%$ din punctaj. 
* Mai multe subşiruri ale lui $S$ formează o **partiţie** dacă elementele reuniunii subşirurilor pot fi reaşezate astfel încât să se obţină exact $S$.
* $x$ modulo $y$ reprezintă restul împărţirii lui $x$ la $y$.

Since the environment does not have `numpy` installed, I will rewrite the solution to use only the standard libraries available in Python. Here's the updated code:

```python
def minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    tails = [0] * len(arr)
    size = 0
    for x in arr:
        i, j = 0, size
        while i != j:
            m = (i + j) // 2
            if tails[m] < x:
                i = m + 1
            else:
                j = m
        tails[i] = x
        size = max(i + 1, size)
    return size

def sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k):
    mod_k = [0] * k
    mod_k[0] = 1
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        current_mod_k = mod_k[:]
        for i in range(k):
            current_mod_k[(i + num) % k] = (current_mod_k[(i + num) % k] + mod_k[i]) % 20011
        mod_k = current_mod_k
        count = (count + mod_k[0]) % 20011
    return count

def main():
    with open('calcule.in', 'r') as fin:
        n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        arr = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

    min_subs = minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr)
    sequences_count = sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k)

    with open('calcule.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{min_subs}\n')
        fout.write(f'{sequences_count}\n')

This code should now work correctly without `numpy`, using only Python's standard library.

The difference in the expected and found result for the sum of sequences divisible by `k` indicates a bug in the implementation of the `sum_sequences_divisible_by_k` function. The function should correctly calculate the number of contiguous subarrays with a sum divisible by `k`, keeping the memory usage within the constraints.

Upon reviewing the code, I see that the implementation is incorrect. When updating `current_mod_k`, the algorithm should only consider new subarrays ending at the current position `num`. It seems that I was mistakenly trying to reuse the entire dynamic programming state in a rolling fashion, which incorrectly counts subarrays. I should initialize `current_mod_k` with `mod_k` only carrying over the count of subarrays with sum 0 (`current_mod_k[0] = mod_k[0]`).

Let's fix the function:

```python
def sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k):
    mod_k = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)  # Initialize with 1 at the 0th position for empty subarray
    count = 0
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        cumulative_sum += num
        current_remainder = cumulative_sum % k
        count = (count + mod_k[current_remainder]) % 20011
        mod_k[current_remainder] = (mod_k[current_remainder] + 1) % 20011
    return count

def minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    tails = []
    for x in arr:
        i = 0
        j = len(tails)
        while i != j:
            m = (i + j) // 2
            if tails[m] < x:
                i = m + 1
            else:
                j = m
        if i == len(tails):
            tails.append(x)
        else:
            tails[i] = x
    return len(tails)

def main():
    with open('calcule.in', 'r') as fin:
        n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        arr = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    
    min_subs = minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr)
    sequences_count = sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k)
    
    with open('calcule.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{min_subs}\n')
        fout.write(f'{sequences_count}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This fixed version should now correctly count the number of contiguous subarrays with a sum divisible by `k` using a cumulative sum approach. Also, a small optimization is made in the LIS function, where I replaced the list `tails` with initialization of size `n` with an empty list that gets appended to, which is slightly more memory efficient.

The provided expected output and the found output are identical, which suggests that the solution is correct. However, based on the previous feedback, it seemed there was an issue with the output. To ensure that the solution is indeed correct and that there was no mistake in the evaluation, I will review and explain the algorithm to further confirm its correctness.

The `minimum_increasing_subsequences` function implements the patience sorting algorithm to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). It does so by iteratively building piles that represent the smallest possible tail of increasing subsequences of different lengths. The number of these piles corresponds to the length of the LIS, which in turn corresponds to the minimum number of strictly increasing subsequences the array can be partitioned into because each element of the original array that is not part of the LIS must start a new increasing subsequence.

The `sum_sequences_divisible_by_k` function calculates the number of contiguous subarrays (also known as sequences) whose sums are divisible by `k`. It uses a cumulative sum approach and a dynamic programming state `mod_k` to keep track of the number of subarrays ending at each position with a sum whose remainder when divided by `k` is `r`, for `r` from `0` to `k-1`. When a new element is added to the subarrays, it updates the counts for each remainder accordingly.

Since the last run of the code provided the expected output, I do not see a need for further fixes. However, I will provide the corrected solution again for clarity:

```python
def minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    tails = []
    for x in arr:
        i = 0
        j = len(tails)
        while i != j:
            m = (i + j) // 2
            if tails[m] < x:
                i = m + 1
            else:
                j = m
        if i == len(tails):
            tails.append(x)
        else:
            tails[i] = x
    return len(tails)

def sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k):
    mod_k = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)  # Initialize with 1 at the 0th position for empty subarray
    count = 0
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        cumulative_sum += num
        current_remainder = cumulative_sum % k
        count = (count + mod_k[current_remainder]) % 20011
        mod_k[current_remainder] = (mod_k[current_remainder] + 1) % 20011
    return count

def main():
    with open('calcule.in', 'r') as fin:
        n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        arr = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    
    min_subs = minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr)
    sequences_count = sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k)
    
    with open('calcule.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{min_subs}\n')
        fout.write(f'{sequences_count}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In conclusion, the code appears to be correct, and the results match the expected output. If there was indeed an issue with the previous output check, it may have been due to a misinterpretation or a clerical error. The code should work as intended for the given problem.

Upon reviewing the provided data, there is no actual difference between the expected output and the found output in the last execution. Both the expected and found output are:

```
4
23
```

This indicates that the implemented solution is correct and that there is no discrepancy that needs to be addressed. It's possible that the message indicating a mismatch in the output was an error or a misunderstanding. The found output is correct and matches what is expected for the input provided.

Since the solution is correct as per the last execution, there is no need to rewrite the solution or apply any fixes. However, for the sake of completeness and to maintain the integrity of the response, I will include the correct solution one more time:

```python
def minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    tails = []
    for x in arr:
        i = 0
        j = len(tails)
        while i != j:
            m = (i + j) // 2
            if tails[m] < x:
                i = m + 1
            else:
                j = m
        if i == len(tails):
            tails.append(x)
        else:
            tails[i] = x
    return len(tails)

def sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k):
    mod_k = [1] + [0] * (k - 1)  # Initialize with 1 at the 0th position for empty subarray
    count = 0
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        cumulative_sum += num
        current_remainder = cumulative_sum % k
        count = (count + mod_k[current_remainder]) % 20011
        mod_k[current_remainder] = (mod_k[current_remainder] + 1) % 20011
    return count

def main():
    with open('calcule.in', 'r') as fin:
        n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        arr = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
    
    min_subs = minimum_increasing_subsequences(arr)
    sequences_count = sum_sequences_divisible_by_k(arr, k)
    
    with open('calcule.out', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(f'{min_subs}\n')
        fout.write(f'{sequences_count}\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The solution above should be used to obtain the result for the given problem statement. The functions `minimum_increasing_subsequences` and `sum_sequences_divisible_by_k` are correctly implemented, and their output is consistent with the example provided.
