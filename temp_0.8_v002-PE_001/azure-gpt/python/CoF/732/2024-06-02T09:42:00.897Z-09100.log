Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `ron.in` and write to `ron.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Lidorienii şi senopictii sunt în conflict pentru ronul fermecat, fiind arbitraţi de orintieni, aleşi de părţile beligerante drept judecători. Orintia a propus: „Ronul fermecat va fi ascuns printre alţi $k$ roni cu acelaşi aspect, dar toţi realizaţi dintr-un material mai greu decât originalul, având masa, standard, diferită de cea a ronului femecat. Pentru a-l descoperi, vă gandiţi că aveţi la dispoziţie o balanţă şi toţi cei $k+1$ roni. Lidorienii, apoi senopictii vor spune un singur număr, reprezentând numărul maxim de cântăriri admis pentru descoperirea ronului fermecat. Dacă nici una dintre părţi nu spune numărul corect, atunci ronul fermecat va rămâne în Orintia. Dacă ambele părţi spun numărul corect, ronul va rămâne tot la orintieni.”. 

# Cerință

Sarcina voastră este să indicaţi ţara care câştigă ronul fermecat: Lidoria - $L$, Senopictia – $S$, Orintia – $O$.


# Date de intrare

Fisierul `ron.in` are pe prima linie numărul $k$, iar pe linia a doua două numere $RL$, respectiv $RS$ separate printr-un spaţiu. 4RL$ reprezintă răspunsul lidorienilor, iar $RS$ răspunsul senopictilor.

# Date de ieșire

Fisierul `ron.out` contine una din literele $L, S$ şi $O$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < k < 10 \ 000$;
* $RL, RS$ sunt numere naturale cel mult egale cu $k$
* ronul fermecat este un cuboid gravat cu semnele fixe ale puterii
* numărul maxim de cântăriri admis nu se obţine cântărind un ron de mai multe ori şi nici cântărind de cât mai multe ori ronii; cântărirea presupune să existe, pe fiecare braţ al balanţei, un număr egal de roni ($1 - 1$, $2 - 2$, etc.)
