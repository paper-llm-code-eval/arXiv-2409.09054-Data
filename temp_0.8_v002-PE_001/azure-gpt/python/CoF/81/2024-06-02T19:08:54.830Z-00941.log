Dezamăgiți de lipsa fotbalului din ultima perioadă, Ștefan și Georgian și-au deschis (în secret) o afacere cu boabe de cafea, comercializând $K$ tipuri diferite de cafea. Astfel, timp de $N$ zile ei produc cafea, urmând să formeze din boabele obținute în zile **consecutive** pachete ce conțin **toate** tipurile de cafea.

Concret, cei doi știu pentru fiecare zi ce tipuri de cafea produc în acea zi (posibil niciun tip, caz în care afacerea ia o pauză), după care ei împart zilele în secvențe continue astfel încât, pentru fiecare tip de cafea, fiecare secvență de zile să conțină cel puțin o zi în care să fie produs acel tip de cafea.

# Cerință
Înainte de a se apuca de împachetat boabele, Ștefan și Georgian își pun două întrebări:

1. Care este numărul maxim de pachete ce pot fi formate?
2. Care este numărul de moduri de a împărți zilele astfel încât să se formeze număr maxim de pachete valide (ce conțin toate tipurile de cafea)?

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsește un număr întreg $P$, reprezentând numărul cerinței de rezolvat.
Pe cea de-a doua linie se găsește un număr întreg $T$, reprezentând numărul de scenarii pentru care va trebui să rezolvați problema.
Urmează cele $T$ instanțe ale problemei, fiecare fiind compusă din $N + 1$ linii: pe prima linie se vor afla două numere întregi $N$ și $K$, reprezentând numărul de zile, respectiv numărul de tipuri diferite de cafea; pe următoarele $N$ linii câte $K$ cifre binare, cea de-a $j$-a cifră de pe linia $i$ fiind $0$ dacă în ziua $i$ tipul $j$ de cafea nu este produs, sau fiind $1$ dacă în ziua $i$ tipul $j$ de cafea este produs.

# Date de ieșire
Pentru fiecare dintre cele $T$ instanțe se va afișa răspunsul, începând de la o linie noua, după cum urmează:

1. Dacă $P = 1$, atunci se va afișa pe o singură linie numărul maxim de pachete valide ce pot fi formate.
2. Dacă $P = 2$, atunci se va afișa pe o singură linie numărul de moduri de a împărți zilele în secvențe continue astfel încât să se formeze număr maxim de pachete. Răspunsul va fi afișat $\text{mod } 1\ 000\ 000\ 007$.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 2$
* $1 ≤ T ≤ 3$
* $1 ≤ N ≤ 200\ 000$
* $1 ≤ K ≤ 20$
* Se garantează că fiecare tip de cafea apare în cel puțin una dintre cele $N$ zile.

## Punctare
* Pentru 6 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 15$
* Pentru alte 6 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 100$
* Pentru alte 9 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 2\ 000$
* Pentru alte 10 puncte: $P = 1, N ≤ 200\ 000$
* Pentru alte 10 puncte: $P = 2, K = 1, N ≤ 200\ 000$
* Pentru alte 4 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 15$
* Pentru alte 4 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 20$
* Pentru alte 9 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 100$
* Pentru alte 8 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 700$
* Pentru alte 8 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 2\ 000$
* Pentru alte 8 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 10\ 000$
* Pentru alte 9 puncte: $P = 2, N ≤ 70\ 000$

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it is clear that there is a bug in the code that calculates the number of ways to divide the days into continuous sequences. The mistake is in how we count the occurrences of each number of valid partitions. We should be counting the occurrences of each value in `valid_partitions` up to the maximum number of packs, not just the maximum number. This mistake leads to incorrect values in the `partition_counts` list, and thus, the wrong number of ways is calculated.

Let's fix the bug in the code:

```python
import sys
from collections import Counter

MOD = 1_000_000_007

# Efficiently read lines from stdin
def input_iter():
    for line in sys.stdin:
        yield line.strip()

lines = input_iter()

# Read the problem we need to solve (1 or 2)
problem = int(next(lines))

# Read T - number of scenarios
T = int(next(lines))

# Function to calculate the number of valid packs
def calculate_packs(N, K, production_days):
    last_occurrence = [-1] * K
    valid_partitions = [0]
    max_packs = 0

    for day in range(N):
        production = production_days[day]
        min_last_occur = N

        for j, prod in enumerate(production):
            if prod == '1':
                last_occurrence[j] = day  # Update the last occurrence for coffee type j

        min_last_occur = min(last_occurrence)

        if min_last_occur != -1:
            valid_partitions.append(valid_partitions[min_last_occur] + 1)
            max_packs = max(max_packs, valid_partitions[-1])
        else:
            valid_partitions.append(0)

    return max_packs, valid_partitions

# Function to calculate the number of ways to divide the days
def calculate_ways(max_packs, valid_partitions):
    counts = Counter(valid_partitions)
    ways = 1
    
    for packs in range(1, max_packs + 1):
        ways = (ways * (counts[packs] + 1)) % MOD
    
    return ways

# Process each scenario
for _ in range(T):
    # Read N and K
    N, K = map(int, next(lines).split())
    production_days = [next(lines) for _ in range(N)]

    # Calculate the number of valid packs
    max_packs, valid_partitions = calculate_packs(N, K, production_days)

    # Output the result based on the problem we are solving
    if problem == 1:
        print(max_packs)
    else:
        ways = calculate_ways(max_packs, valid_partitions)
        print(ways)
```

This solution should now correctly implement the algorithm to solve both problems. It calculates the number of valid packs and the ways to partition days to form the maximum number of valid packs, taking into account the fixed calculation of occurrences for partitions values.

The discrepancies between the expected and found output indicate there's an error in the logic used to calculate the number of ways to divide the days into continuous sequences that form the maximum number of valid packages. The previous solution has incorrectly implemented the counting of partition sequences which leads to an overestimation of the number of ways.

The number of ways to partition should be calculated based on the frequency of the smallest available window that can form a package, and then considering the flexibility given by larger windows that can still form the same number of packages.

Let's fix the solution by correcting the logic for calculating the number of ways to partition the days, and ensure we use the correct algorithm to get the expected results.

```python
import sys

MOD = 1_000_000_007

def read_input():
    return [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]

def solve_problem(input_lines):
    lines = iter(input_lines)
    problem = int(next(lines))
    T = int(next(lines))

    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, next(lines).split())
        coffee_types = [0] * K
        max_packages = 0
        ways = 1
        subsequences = []

        for day in range(N):
            coffee = next(lines)
            # Update the last seen day for each coffee type
            for i, c in enumerate(coffee):
                if c == '1':
                    coffee_types[i] = day + 1

            # Find the earliest day for which all types of coffee are available
            min_day = min(coffee_types)
            if min_day > 0:
                subsequences.append(min_day)
                max_packages = max(max_packages, subsequences.count(min_day))

        if problem == 1:
            print(max_packages)
        else:
            last_package_day = N + 1
            for day in subsequences[::-1]:
                if subsequences.count(day) == max_packages:
                    last_package_day = day
                    break
            ways = 1
            package_count = 0
            for day in subsequences[::-1]:
                if day < last_package_day:
                    ways = (ways * (package_count + 1)) % MOD
                    package_count = 0
                    last_package_day = day
                package_count += 1
            ways = (ways * (package_count + 1)) % MOD
            print(ways)

# Read input, solve the problem, and print output
input_lines = read_input()
solve_problem(input_lines)
```

This revised solution reads the input, manages the logic for both calculating the maximum number of packages and the number of ways to partition the days, and prints the output accordingly. It ensures that we are considering the right subsequence counts when calculating the number of ways. It should now provide the correct output for problem 2, matching the expected results.

Upon further review, it becomes clear that the discrepancy between the expected and found result for the first input data is due to an incorrect calculation of the maximum number of packages. The expected result is 2 packages, but the output is showing 1. This indicates that there is an issue with how we are tracking the last occurrence of each type of coffee and determining the subsequences that can form a complete package.

The bug in the previous solution appears to be in how we are handling the subsequences and the condition for when a complete package can be formed. We need to ensure that each complete package contains at least one day where each type of coffee is produced.

Let's correct the solution by using a different approach:

1. Maintain an array `last_occurrence` to track the last occurrence of production for each type of coffee.
2. Use a sliding window approach to determine the subsequences that can form a complete package.
3. For problem 2 (calculating the number of ways), use dynamic programming to find the count of ways for each number of packages that can be formed.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
import sys
from collections import deque

MOD = 1_000_000_007

def input_lines():
    return map(str.strip, sys.stdin)

def solve_problem(input_lines):
    lines = iter(input_lines)
    problem = int(next(lines))
    T = int(next(lines))

    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, next(lines).split())
        production = [next(lines) for _ in range(N)]
        last_occurrence = [-1] * K
        num_of_packages = 0
        start = 0
        
        if problem == 1:
            for end in range(N):
                for i in range(K):
                    if production[end][i] == '1':
                        last_occurrence[i] = end
                while min(last_occurrence) > start:
                    start += 1
                if -1 not in last_occurrence:
                    num_of_packages = max(num_of_packages, end - start + 1)
            print(num_of_packages)
        else:
            # Problem 2: Count the number of ways to partition the days
            dp = [1]  # Base Case: 1 way to partition zero days
            queue = deque([0] * K)  # A queue to hold the minimum last occurrences
            for end in range(N):
                # Update the last occurrences for the current day
                for i in range(K):
                    if production[end][i] == '1':
                        queue[i] = dp[-1]
                # Calculate the number of ways to partition up to the current day
                dp.append(sum(queue) % MOD)
            print(dp[-1])

# Read input, solve the problem, and print output
solve_problem(input_lines())
```

This corrected solution should now provide the correct output for both problem 1 and problem 2, matching the expected results. It uses a sliding window to find subsequences for problem 1 and dynamic programming for problem 2.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual output indicate that there is a flaw in the logic for determining the maximum number of packages that can be formed (problem 1). The expected output for the second data set is 2, but the program is outputting 3, which suggests that we're not correctly identifying the subsequences that cover all types of coffee.

Let's correct the solution by implementing a sliding window approach that ensures we correctly identify the minimum size subsequence that includes at least one day of production for each type of coffee, and then use that subsequence to increment the count of valid packages.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import sys
from itertools import accumulate

# Function to read from stdin
def read_input():
    return sys.stdin.readlines()

# Function to solve the problem
def solve_problem(input_lines):
    lines = iter(input_lines)
    problem = int(next(lines))
    T = int(next(lines))

    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, next(lines).split())
        production = [next(lines).strip() for _ in range(N)]

        # Last occurrence index for each coffee type
        last_occurrence = [-1] * K
        # List to store the earliest day when a package can be completed
        earliest_complete_package_day = [0] * (N + 1)

        for day, prod in enumerate(production):
            complete_package = True
            # Update the last occurrence index for each coffee type
            for type_index in range(K):
                if prod[type_index] == '1':
                    last_occurrence[type_index] = day
                # Check if there is any coffee type that has not been produced yet
                if last_occurrence[type_index] == -1:
                    complete_package = False
            if complete_package:
                earliest_day = min(last_occurrence)
                earliest_complete_package_day[day + 1] = earliest_complete_package_day[earliest_day] + 1

        max_packages = earliest_complete_package_day[-1]
        if problem == 1:
            print(max_packages)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of ways to divide the days into subsequences
            counts = list(accumulate(1 if x == max_packages else 0 for x in earliest_complete_package_day))
            num_ways = 1
            for count in counts:
                num_ways = (num_ways * (count + 1)) % MOD

            print(num_ways % MOD)

# Main execution
input_lines = read_input()
solve_problem(input_lines)
```

This solution should now correctly count the maximum number of packages that can be formed (for problem 1) by marking the earliest day when a complete package can be formed and incrementing the count whenever a new earliest day is found. For problem 2, it will correctly calculate the number of ways to divide the days based on the counts of these earliest days. It reads input from stdin, solves the problem, and outputs the results to stdout.

The exit code 1 and the accompanying standard error message indicate that the variable `MOD` is not defined within the scope of the `solve_problem` function. The error occurs because I referenced `MOD` in the calculation of `num_ways` without having defined it earlier in the function or passed it as a global constant.

To fix this issue, we need to define `MOD` at the beginning of the script so that it is available throughout the script's execution. Here is the corrected solution with `MOD` properly defined:

```python

This script defines `MOD` at the top level, reads input from stdin, processes the input to calculate either the maximum number of packages or the number of ways to divide the days into sequences (depending on the problem number), and prints the result to stdout.

---------- assistant ----------

The exit code and the accompanying error message indicate that there's an attempt to convert a newline character (`'\n'`) to an integer, which is resulting in a `ValueError`. This error happens because when reading the production lines, the code attempts to convert each character, including possible newlines or spaces, into integers.

To fix this program, we need to ensure that when reading the production lines, we strip out any whitespace or newline characters before converting each character to an integer.

Below is the revised code with the fix for reading the input data:

```python
import sys

MOD = 1_000_000_007

# Function to read from stdin
def read_input():
    return sys.stdin.readlines()

# Function to solve the problem
def solve_problem(input_lines):
    lines = iter(input_lines)
    problem = int(next(lines))
    T = int(next(lines))

    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, next(lines).split())
        last_seen_day = [-1] * K
        earliest_day = 0
        num_packages = 0
        ways = 1
        partitions = [0] * (N + 1)

        # Reading the production for each day and strip whitespace
        production_days = [next(lines).strip() for _ in range(N)]

        # Solving for problem 1
        for i, production in enumerate(production_days):
            for k, prod in enumerate(production):
                if prod == '1':
                    last_seen_day[k] = i
                
            # If we have seen all types of coffee at least once
            if min(last_seen_day) >= 0:
                earliest_day = max(earliest_day, min(last_seen_day))
                num_packages += 1
                partitions[earliest_day + 1] += 1

        if problem == 1:
            print(num_packages)
        else:
            # Solving for problem 2
            partitions = list(accumulate(partitions)) # Prefix sum to get partitions count
            for i in range(1, num_packages + 1):
                ways = (ways * (partitions.count(i) + 1)) % MOD
            print(ways)

# Read input, solve the problem, and print output
input_lines = read_input()
solve_problem(input_lines)
```

This code properly strips any whitespace before processing each production line, solves the problem, and prints the output. It should now function correctly without encountering type conversion errors from unexpected newline characters.
