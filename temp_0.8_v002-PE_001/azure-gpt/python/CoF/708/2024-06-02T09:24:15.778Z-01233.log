Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `anagrame.in` and write to `anagrame.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un cuvânt format numai din litere mici. Numim anagramă un cuvânt format din literele cuvântului dat, schimbând eventual ordinea literelor. De exemplu o anagramă a cuvântului tamara este cuvântul armata. Evident, un cuvânt poate fi considerat o anagramă a lui însuşi.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să genereze toate anagramele unui cuvânt dat, în ordine lexicografică.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `anagrame.in` conţine pe prima linie cuvântul dat.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `anagrame.out` va conţine în ordine anagramele cuvântului dat, câte una pe linie.

# Restricții și precizări

* Cuvântul dat are cel mult $10$ litere mici.
* Cuvântul $x = x_1 \ x_2 \dots x_n$ precede cuvântul $y = y_1 \ y_2 \dots y_n$ dacă există un indice $k \in {1, 2, \dots, n}$ astfel încât $x_i = y_i$, $i \in {1, 2, \dots, k - 1}$, iar litera $x_k$ precede în alfabet litera $y_k$.

Example:
`anagrame.in`
```
ana
```

`anagrame.out`
```
aan
ana
naa
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import permutations

# Reading the word from the input file 'anagrame.in'
with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as file:
    word = file.readline().strip()

# Generating all unique permutations of the word
unique_permutations = np.unique([''.join(p) for p in permutations(word)])

# Sorting the unique permutations lexicographically
sorted_permutations = np.sort(unique_permutations)

# Writing the sorted anagrams to the output file 'anagrame.out'
with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write('\n'.join(sorted_permutations))
```

This code will read the input from `anagrame.in`, generate all unique anagrams of the given word, sort them lexicographically, and write them to the output file `anagrame.out`. It uses `numpy` to generate unique elements and sorts the array, which is efficient in both time and memory. However, generating all permutations might not be the most memory-efficient approach for words with many characters since it creates many temporary strings. Nonetheless, given the restriction that words have at most 10 letters, this approach should work within the memory limit.

The exit code and the standard error indicate that the module `numpy` is not installed in the environment where the code is being run. In the challenge description, it was mentioned to utilize `numpy` and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible. However, if `numpy` is not available, we need to find an alternative solution that doesn't rely on it.

Given that, we can solve the problem purely in Python using standard libraries. The `itertools` module provides a permutations function which we can use to generate the anagrams, and we can then use a `set` to ensure uniqueness before sorting.

Let's rewrite the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Reading the word from the input file 'anagrame.in'
with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as file:
    word = file.readline().strip()

# Generating all unique permutations of the word
unique_permutations = set(permutations(word))

# Sorting the unique permutations lexicographically
sorted_permutations = sorted([''.join(p) for p in unique_permutations])

# Writing the sorted anagrams to the output file 'anagrame.out'
with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write('\n'.join(sorted_permutations))
```

This code will achieve the same result as the previous one, but it uses only the standard libraries that are available in a typical Python installation. The use of `set` ensures that only unique permutations are considered, and `sorted` provides the lexicographic sorting needed for the output. This should work within the memory limit specified, as the most memory-intensive step is the generation of the permutations, which is managed by keeping only unique instances in a `set`.

Please note that although this solution is efficient for the given constraints, the permutations function generates all possible orderings of the input and can have a factorial time complexity, which can be quite costly for larger input sizes. However, since the input size is constrained to at most 10 letters, the solution is practical for this specific case.
