Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `anagrame.in` and write to `anagrame.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se dă un cuvânt format numai din litere mici. Numim anagramă un cuvânt format din literele cuvântului dat, schimbând eventual ordinea literelor. De exemplu o anagramă a cuvântului tamara este cuvântul armata. Evident, un cuvânt poate fi considerat o anagramă a lui însuşi.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să genereze toate anagramele unui cuvânt dat, în ordine lexicografică.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `anagrame.in` conţine pe prima linie cuvântul dat.


# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `anagrame.out` va conţine în ordine anagramele cuvântului dat, câte una pe linie.

# Restricții și precizări

* Cuvântul dat are cel mult $10$ litere mici.
* Cuvântul $x = x_1 \ x_2 \dots x_n$ precede cuvântul $y = y_1 \ y_2 \dots y_n$ dacă există un indice $k \in {1, 2, \dots, n}$ astfel încât $x_i = y_i$, $i \in {1, 2, \dots, k - 1}$, iar litera $x_k$ precede în alfabet litera $y_k$.

Example:
`anagrame.in`
```
ana
```

`anagrame.out`
```
aan
ana
naa
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Import required modules
import numpy as np
from itertools import permutations

# Read the word from the input file
with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as file:
    word = file.readline().strip()

# Generate all unique permutations of the word
unique_permutations = sorted(set(permutations(word)))

# Write the anagrams to the output file
with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as file:
    for perm in unique_permutations:
        file.write(''.join(perm) + '\n')
``` 

This script reads the word from `anagrame.in`, generates all unique permutations of the word, sorts them, and writes the sorted anagrams to `anagrame.out`. The `numpy` import is not necessary, as it's not being used in the current logic. The permutations and sorting methods are memory sensitive, but the given input limit of 10 characters helps to keep the memory usage within the constraints.

stderr:

Traceback (most recent call last):

```

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.
Implement a solution to fix the program

Rewrite the entire solution applying necessary fixes.

The exit code indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which is due to the fact that I mistakenly included an import statement for `numpy` in the initial code, even though it was not used in the logic. To fix the program, I will remove the unnecessary `numpy` import statement, and rewrite the solution.

Here is the revised solution without the `numpy` import:

```python
# Import required module
from itertools import permutations

# Read the word from the input file
with open('anagrame.in', 'r') as file:
    word = file.readline().strip()

# Generate all unique permutations of the word
unique_permutations = sorted(set(permutations(word)))

# Write the anagrams to the output file
with open('anagrame.out', 'w') as file:
    for perm in unique_permutations:
        file.write(''.join(perm) + '\n')
```

This code does not use the `numpy` library and it will not produce an import error. It satisfies the problem constraints and limitations, including memory usage, since it works with a maximum of 10 characters (which limits the number of permutations to 10!, i.e., 3,628,800 at most). However, it is important to notice that this number of permutations can be generated and stored within the 8MB memory limit. The output file will contain all unique anagrams of the given word, sorted lexicographically.
