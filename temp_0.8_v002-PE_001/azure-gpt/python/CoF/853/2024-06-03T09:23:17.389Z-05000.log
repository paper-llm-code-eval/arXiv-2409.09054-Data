Discul dur (hard disk) este un dispozitiv utilizat pentru stocarea datelor. Stocarea se face pe o suprafață magnetică dispusă pe platane rotunde metalice. Pe un platan, datele sunt organizate în **piste** și **sectoare**, iar zona aflată la intersecția dintre o pistă și un sector poartă denumirea de **cluster**.

Un cluster poate avea două stări: **liber**, dacă nu conține date, sau **ocupat**, atunci când conține date.

Un platan se numește **defragmentat** dacă toți clusterii ocupați de pe fiecare pistă sunt așezați în ordine consecutivă. Defragmentarea se realizează prin mutarea unor clusteri ocupați și are rolul de a micșora timpul de acces la date. Mutarea unui cluster reprezintă transferul datelor de la un cluster ocupat către un cluster liber de pe aceeași pistă.

~[defrag.png|width=90em|align=center]

# Cerință
Cunoscând numărul de piste $P$ și de sectoare $S$ al unui platan, numărul și poziția clusterilor ocupați, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. numărul de piste care au toți clusterii liberi;
2. numărul **minim** de mutări de clusteri, pentru fiecare pistă în parte, astfel încât platanul să devină defragmentat.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare `defrag.in` se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.
Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsesc două numere naturale $P$ și $S$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ.
A treia linie conţine un număr natural $C$ reprezentând numărul total de clusteri ocupați de pe platan, iar pe fiecare din următoarele $C$ linii se găsește câte o pereche de valori $p_i$ şi $s_i$, $1 \leq i \leq C$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând pista, respectiv sectorul unde se află fiecare cluster ocupat.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire este `defrag.out`.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de piste care au toți clusterii liberi.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conține pe prima linie $P$ numere naturale notate $M_i$, $1 \leq i \leq P$, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, unde $M_i$ reprezintă numărul minim de mutări de clusteri, dintre cei aflați pe pista $i$, astfel încât pe pista $i$ clusterii ocupați să se găsească într-o ordine consecutivă.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $1 \leq P \leq 100$
- $1 \leq S \leq 360$
- $1 \leq C \leq P \cdot S$
- Pistele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $P$ începând cu pista exterioară.
- Sectoarele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $S$ în sensul acelor de ceasornic începând cu sectorul $1$.
- Dacă o pistă are toți clusterii liberi, atunci valoarea cerută la a doua cerință este $0$.
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 2$.

The input and output operations are performed by reading and writing to files directly, without using `input()` or `print()`.

It seems that the environment where the code is being executed does not have the `numpy` library installed. Since the environment constraints and the memory limit, I will rewrite the solution without using numpy or any other third-party libraries, relying only on Python's built-in capabilities. Below is the complete solution without using numpy.

```python
# Read input from defrag.in
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as fin:
    V = int(fin.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    C = int(fin.readline().strip())
    clusters = [[False] * S for _ in range(P)]
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        clusters[p - 1][s - 1] = True

def count_free_tracks(clusters):
    return sum(all(not cell for cell in track) for track in clusters)

def min_moves_per_track(clusters, S):
    moves = []
    for track in clusters:
        occupied = [i for i, occupied in enumerate(track) if occupied]
        if not occupied:
            moves.append(0)
            continue
        min_moves = S
        for i in range(len(occupied)):
            rotated = occupied[i:] + [x + S for x in occupied[:i]]
            current_moves = rotated[-1] - rotated[0] + 1 - len(occupied)
            if current_moves < min_moves:
                min_moves = current_moves
        moves.append(min_moves)
    return moves

# Write output to defrag.out
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as fout:
    if V == 1:
        fout.write(f'{count_free_tracks(clusters)}\n')
    elif V == 2:
        moves = min_moves_per_track(clusters, S)
        fout.write(" ".join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

This solution uses Python's built-in list comprehensions and functions to perform the necessary calculations. It should work within the given memory constraints by using a list of lists to represent the cluster states and perform the logic to find the minimum number of moves for defragmentation. The input and output operations are still performed by reading and writing to files directly.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is likely due to an error in the calculation of the minimum number of moves for defragmentation. The error seems to occur in the `min_moves_per_track` function. Let's revisit the logic for this function.

The function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of moves to defragment each track. To defragment a track, we need to move the clusters so that all occupied clusters are consecutive. The original solution attempts to rotate the indices of the occupied clusters, but it is likely that the calculation of `current_moves` is incorrect.

Let's correct the `min_moves_per_track` function and ensure that it finds the correct minimum number of moves:

```python
def min_moves_per_track(clusters, S):
    moves = []
    for track in clusters:
        occupied = [i for i, cell in enumerate(track) if cell]

        if not occupied:  # No occupied clusters, no moves needed
            moves.append(0)
            continue

        # The idea is to find the largest sequence of free clusters and count the occupied ones outside it
        # The number of moves will be the number of occupied clusters outside the largest sequence of free clusters
        min_moves = len(occupied)
        for start in range(S):
            end = start
            while end < S and not track[end % S]:
                end += 1
            # The window [start, end) represents free clusters; count occupied clusters outside the window
            current_moves = len(occupied) - (end - start)
            min_moves = min(min_moves, current_moves)

        moves.append(min_moves)
    return moves

# Use the updated function in the complete solution
# Read input from defrag.in
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as fin:
    V = int(fin.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    C = int(fin.readline().strip())
    clusters = [[False] * S for _ in range(P)]
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        clusters[p - 1][s - 1] = True

# Write output to defrag.out
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as fout:
    if V == 1:
        fout.write(f'{count_free_tracks(clusters)}\n')
    elif V == 2:
        moves = min_moves_per_track(clusters, S)
        fout.write(" ".join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

This corrected function tries to find the largest sequence of free clusters in one pass and then calculates the number of occupied clusters that would need to be moved to make the track defragmented. This should output the correct minimum number of moves for each track.

The error message indicates that the function `count_free_tracks` is not defined. It seems I forgot to include the definition of that function in my last code block. The `count_free_tracks` function is supposed to count the number of tracks where all clusters are free (i.e., not occupied).

Let's correct the solution by including the definition of `count_free_tracks` and ensure the entire solution is in one code block.

```python
# Define the count_free_tracks function
def count_free_tracks(clusters):
    return sum(all(not cell for cell in track) for track in clusters)

# Define the min_moves_per_track function
def min_moves_per_track(clusters, S):
    moves = []
    for track in clusters:
        occupied = [i for i, cell in enumerate(track) if cell]

        if not occupied:
            moves.append(0)
            continue

        min_moves = len(occupied)
        for start in range(S):
            end = start
            while end < S and not track[end % S]:
                end += 1
            current_moves = len(occupied) - (end - start)
            min_moves = min(min_moves, current_moves)

        moves.append(min_moves)
    return moves

# Read input from defrag.in
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as fin:
    V = int(fin.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    C = int(fin.readline().strip())
    clusters = [[False] * S for _ in range(P)]
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        clusters[p - 1][s - 1] = True

# Write output to defrag.out

        moves_str = " ".join(map(str, moves))
        fout.write(moves_str + '\n')
```

This code block now includes both required functions, `count_free_tracks` and `min_moves_per_track`, which are used to calculate the desired output based on the input file `defrag.in`. After performing the calculations, the code writes the results to the output file `defrag.out`.

The discrepancy in the expected and found output indicates that there is still a bug in the `min_moves_per_track` function. The error seems to be in the logic used to calculate the number of moves required to defragment each track. Specifically, the code for finding the largest sequence of free clusters and counting the occupied ones outside it is incorrect.

When we find the longest sequence of free clusters, we need to account for the possibility that the sequence wraps around the end of the array (since the sectors are in a circular arrangement). The current implementation does not handle the wrapping scenario correctly. 

Let's fix the `min_moves_per_track` function by implementing a sliding window approach that correctly handles the wrapping:

```python
# Define the min_moves_per_track function
def min_moves_per_track(clusters, S):
    moves = []
    for track in clusters:
        occupied = [i for i, cell in enumerate(track) if cell]

        if not occupied:  # No occupied clusters, no moves needed
            moves.append(0)
            continue

        # The idea is to find the largest sequence of consecutive occupied clusters
        # The number of moves will be the total occupied minus the size of the largest sequence
        occupied += [i + S for i in occupied]  # Duplicate indices to handle wraparound
        max_consecutive = 0
        for i in range(len(occupied) // 2):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(occupied)):
                if occupied[j] - occupied[i] == j - i:
                    max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, j - i + 1)
                else:
                    break

        moves.append(len(occupied) // 2 - max_consecutive)

    return moves

# Include the count_free_tracks function
def count_free_tracks(clusters):
    return sum(all(not cell for cell in track) for track in clusters)

# Read input from defrag.in
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as fin:
    V = int(fin.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    C = int(fin.readline().strip())
    clusters = [[False] * S for _ in range(P)]
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        clusters[p - 1][s - 1] = True

# Write output to defrag.out
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as fout:
    if V == 1:
        fout.write(f'{count_free_tracks(clusters)}\n')
    elif V == 2:
        moves = min_moves_per_track(clusters, S)
        fout.write(" ".join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

In this corrected solution, we duplicate the list of occupied indices to effectively deal with the circular nature of the tracks. Then, we use a nested loop to find the largest sequence of consecutive occupied clusters, including those that wrap around. The number of moves is then calculated as the total number of occupied clusters minus the size of the largest consecutive sequence. This should give the correct minimum number of moves for defragmentation.

The code did not produce the expected output because the logic for calculating the minimum number of moves is still incorrect. The previous implementation did not correctly handle the circular nature of the tracks. 

A correct approach to this problem involves finding the longest sequence of occupied clusters that includes handling the wrap-around case, and then computing the number of moves as the total number of occupied clusters minus the size of this longest sequence.

Let's fix the `min_moves_per_track` function using a different strategy. We will create a list that includes the distances between each pair of consecutive occupied clusters, and take into account the wrap-around by adding the distance from the last occupied cluster to the first one. The sum of the S largest distances (which corresponds to the largest gap of free clusters) will give us the number of clusters that don't need to be moved. Subtracting this from the total number of occupied clusters will give us the minimum number of moves.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Define the min_moves_per_track function
def min_moves_per_track(clusters, S):
    moves = []
    for track in clusters:
        occupied = [i for i, cell in enumerate(track) if cell]

        if not occupied:  # No occupied clusters, no moves needed
            moves.append(0)
            continue

        # Calculate the distances between consecutive occupied clusters
        distances = [occupied[i + 1] - occupied[i] for i in range(len(occupied) - 1)]
        # Add the distance from the last to the first, considering wrap-around
        distances.append(S - occupied[-1] + occupied[0])

        # The minimum number of moves is the total number of occupied clusters minus
        # the sum of the 'S - 1' largest distances (largest gap of free clusters)
        min_moves = len(occupied) - (sum(sorted(distances, reverse=True)[:S - 1]))
        moves.append(min_moves)

    return moves

# Include the count_free_tracks function
def count_free_tracks(clusters):
    return sum(all(not cell for cell in track) for track in clusters)

# Read input from defrag.in
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as fin:
    V = int(fin.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    C = int(fin.readline().strip())
    clusters = [[False] * S for _ in range(P)]
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        clusters[p - 1][s - 1] = True

# Write output to defrag.out
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as fout:
    if V == 1:
        fout.write(f'{count_free_tracks(clusters)}\n')
    elif V == 2:
        moves = min_moves_per_track(clusters, S)
        fout.write(" ".join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

In this solution, we address the circular arrangement by considering the distance between the last and first occupied clusters in our calculations for the minimum number of moves. This should produce the correct output that matches the expected result.

It's evident that the previous algorithm for calculating the minimum number of moves is still incorrect. The output is giving negative numbers, which are not possible in this context. It seems the error lies in the calculation of distances between the occupied clusters and their subsequent use.

To fix the algorithm, we should try a different approach where we simulate the defragmentation process by finding the optimal position to start the sequence of occupied clusters. This can be achieved by iterating through each position and counting the number of moves required if we start from that position.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Define the min_moves_per_track function
def min_moves_per_track(clusters, S):
    moves = []
    for track in clusters:
        occupied_indices = [i for i, cell in enumerate(track) if cell]
        num_occupied = len(occupied_indices)

        if num_occupied == 0:  # No occupied clusters, no moves needed
            moves.append(0)
            continue

        # The strategy is to try starting the consecutive sequence from each occupied cluster
        # and calculate the number of moves needed. We will take the minimum from all these trials.
        min_moves = float('inf')
        for start_index in occupied_indices:
            # Calculate the distance to the end of the occupied sequence from start_index
            end_index = (start_index + num_occupied - 1) % S
            if start_index <= end_index:
                # The sequence doesn't wrap around the end of the track
                moves_needed = sum(1 for i in range(start_index, end_index + 1) if not track[i % S])
            else:
                # The sequence wraps around, so we need to split it into two parts
                moves_needed = sum(1 for i in range(start_index, S) if not track[i % S])
                moves_needed += sum(1 for i in range(0, end_index + 1) if not track[i % S])

            # Update min_moves if the current trial requires fewer moves
            min_moves = min(min_moves, moves_needed)

        moves.append(min_moves)

    return moves

# Include the count_free_tracks function
def count_free_tracks(clusters):
    return sum(all(not cell for cell in track) for track in clusters)

# Read input from defrag.in
with open('defrag.in', 'r') as fin:
    V = int(fin.readline().strip())
    P, S = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    C = int(fin.readline().strip())
    clusters = [[False] * S for _ in range(P)]
    for _ in range(C):
        p, s = map(int, fin.readline().split())
        clusters[p - 1][s - 1] = True

# Write output to defrag.out
with open('defrag.out', 'w') as fout:
    if V == 1:
        fout.write(f'{count_free_tracks(clusters)}\n')
    elif V == 2:
        moves = min_moves_per_track(clusters, S)
        fout.write(" ".join(map(str, moves)) + '\n')
```

In this solution, `min_moves_per_track` now correctly simulates the defragmentation process for each track by considering each possible starting position for the occupied clusters, accounting for wrap-around sequences, and then selecting the position that results in the fewest moves required. This should produce the expected output.
