După cum probabil știți, contabilii își țin datele sub formă de tabele și calculează tot felul de sume pe linii și pe coloane. Contabilul nostru Atnoc și-a organizat valorile sub forma unui tabel cu $n$ linii (numerotate de la $1$ la $n$) și $m$ coloane (numerotate de la $1$ la $m$). Elementele de pe ultima coloană sunt sumele elementelor de pe linii (mai exact, elementul de pe linia $i$ și coloana $m$ este egal cu suma elementelor de pe linia $i$ aflate pe coloanele $1, 2, \dots, m-1$), iar elementele de pe ultima linie sunt sumele elementelor de pe coloane (mai exact, elementul de pe linia $n$ și coloana $i$ este egal cu suma elementelor de pe coloana $i$ aflate pe liniile $1, 2, \dots, n-1$). Un exemplu de astfel de tabel este dat în figura următoare.

Din păcate, Atnoc a stropit cu apă minunatul său tabel și astfel o parte dintre numerele din tabel au devenit ilizibile.

~[tabel.png|width=30em]

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să reconstituie toate datele din tabel.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului text de intrare `tabel.in` se află două numere naturale $n$ și $m$, separate printr-un spațiu, ce reprezintă numărul de linii și respectiv numărul de coloane ale tabelului. Pe cea de a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se află un număr natural $p$ care reprezintă numărul de valori nedeteriorate din tabel. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $p$ linii se află câte trei numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu $l \ c \ v$, unde $l$ este numărul liniei, $c$ este numărul coloanei și $v$ este valoarea elementului de pe linia $l$ și coloana $c$ din tabel.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul text de ieșire `tabel.out` se va scrie tabelul reconstituit, pe $n$ linii câte $m$ valori separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < n, m \leq 50$
* Valorile din tabel sunt numere naturale $< 32 \ 000$.
* În toate testele datele din tabel pot fi reconstituite.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())
    # Initialize the table with zeros
    table = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)
    # Fill in the known values
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[l-1, c-1] = v

# Reconstruct the table
# Fill in the missing values in the last row and column
for i in range(n-1):
    table[i, -1] = np.sum(table[i, :-1])
for i in range(m-1):
    table[-1, i] = np.sum(table[:-1, i])

# Fill in the missing values for the inner cells
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        if table[i, j] == 0:
            table[i, j] = table[i, -1] - np.sum(table[i, :j]) - np.sum(table[i, j+1:-1])

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as file:
    for row in table:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This implementation reads the input from 'tabel.in', processes the table by filling in the zeros based on the sum constraints of the table, and then writing the reconstituted table to 'tabel.out'. The use of numpy arrays and vectorized operations helps to keep the solution efficient.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the current environment. Since we have a memory constraint and need to optimize for both time and memory usage, it's important to work with the Python standard library to avoid any additional memory overhead that might come from importing external libraries like `numpy`.

We must rewrite the solution without using `numpy`, leveraging built-in Python functionalities instead. Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())
    # Initialize the table with zero values
    table = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Fill in the known values
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[l-1][c-1] = v

# Reconstruct the table
# Fill in the missing values in the last row and column
for i in range(n-1):
    table[i][m-1] = sum(table[i][:-1])
for j in range(m-1):
    table[n-1][j] = sum(row[j] for row in table[:-1])

# Fill in the missing values for the inner cells
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        if table[i][j] == 0:
            table[i][j] = table[i][m-1] - sum(table[i][:j]) - sum(table[i][j+1:m-1])

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as file:
    for row in table:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This solution uses a list comprehension to create a 2D list that represents the table, and then uses built-in Python functions like `sum()` to work with the table data. This adjustment ensures that we meet the memory limit and dependency requirements.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to a flaw in the logic for filling the missing values for the inner cells. The current algorithm only updates the values at the end of each row and column, but it does not correctly propagate those values to the inner cells when they are not specified in the input data.

To fix this, we need to properly calculate the missing inner cell values by considering the following:
- Each inner cell value can be determined by subtracting the known row and column elements from the respective row and column totals.
- Once the inner values of a row or column are determined, the last element (sum) for that row or column should already be set correctly and does not need to be recalculated.

Here is the revised solution that includes the correct logic for reconstructing the table:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())
    # Initialize the table with zero values
    table = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    # Track the filled cells in each row and column
    filled_rows = [0] * n
    filled_cols = [0] * m
    # Fill in the known values and keep track of filled cells
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[l-1][c-1] = v
        filled_rows[l-1] += 1
        filled_cols[c-1] += 1

# Reconstruct the table
# Calculate inner cells based on known values
for r in range(n-1):
    for c in range(m-1):
        # If cell is not filled
        if table[r][c] == 0:
            # If this is the last unfilled cell in the row/column, calculate it
            if filled_rows[r] == m - 1:
                table[r][c] = table[r][m-1] - sum(table[r][:m-1])
                filled_cols[c] += 1
            elif filled_cols[c] == n - 1:
                table[r][c] = table[n-1][c] - sum(table[i][c] for i in range(n-1))
                filled_rows[r] += 1
# Rows and columns are now filled, last cell is already correct
# Fix the last row elements by subtracting the sum of previous elements
for c in range(m-1):
    table[n-1][c] = table[n-1][m-1] - sum(table[r][c] for r in range(n-1))

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as file:
    for row in table:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

In this corrected version, we keep track of which rows and columns are already fully filled. If a cell is not specified and is the last unfilled cell in its row or column, we calculate its value based on the total for that row or column. Once the inner cells are calculated, we update the totals for the last row. This should give us the correct output as specified in the expected result.

The found output still does not match the expected output due to a logical error in the algorithm. The process to fill the inner cells is incorrect; it does not account for the interdependencies between the inner cells and the sums along the rows and columns correctly.

To fix this, we must first calculate the sums for all the filled cells in each row and column, then use these sums to determine the missing values. The last cell in each row and column (the sum cells) will be used to calculate the values of the inner cells by subtracting the sum of known values in that row or column from the total.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())
    # Initialize the table with zero values and known sum values set to None
    table = [[None if i == m-1 or j == n-1 else 0 for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]
    # Read the known values and fill the table
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[l-1][c-1] = v

# Calculate the missing inner values
for i in range(n-1):
    row_sum = sum(x for x in table[i] if x is not None)
    table[i][m-1] = row_sum

for j in range(m-1):
    col_sum = sum(table[i][j] for i in range(n-1) if table[i][j] is not None)
    table[n-1][j] = col_sum

# Now, find the missing values for each cell that has not been filled yet
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        if table[i][j] is None:
            table[i][j] = table[i][m-1] - sum(x for x in table[i][:m-1] if x is not None)

# Calculate the last cell in the bottom right corner
table[n-1][m-1] = sum(table[n-1][j] for j in range(m-1))

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as file:
    for row in table:
        file.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in row) + '\n')
```

This solution calculates the row and column sums first, then fills in the missing values based on those sums. The last value in the bottom right corner is the sum of the final row's values. This should now yield the correct output as expected.

It seems that previous approaches did not correctly handle the logic for reconstructing the inner cells of the table. To fix this issue, we need to determine the sum for each row and column based on the provided non-deteriorated values, and then infer the missing values.

The mistake is that we need to calculate row sums and column sums first, except for the last row and column which are already provided. Then, we need to fill in the missing values by subtracting the known sum from the sum of the known values in each row or column.

Here is a corrected solution:

```python
def write_table(filename, table):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        for row in table:
            f.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')

# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())

    # Initialize the table with None values
    table = [[None] * m for _ in range(n)]

    # Fill in the known values
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[l-1][c-1] = v

# Calculate row and column sums
row_sums = [None] * (n - 1)
col_sums = [None] * (m - 1)

for i in range(n - 1):
    row_sums[i] = table[i][-1]  # The last value in each row is the sum of that row

for j in range(m - 1):
    col_sums[j] = table[-1][j]  # The last value in each column is the sum of that column

# Fill in the missing values for the inner cells
for i in range(n - 1):
    row_known_sum = sum(x for x in table[i] if x is not None)
    for j in range(m - 1):
        if table[i][j] is None:
            table[i][j] = row_sums[i] - row_known_sum

# Recalculate the row_known_sum after filling in the missing values
for i in range(n - 1):
    row_known_sum = sum(table[i][:-1])
    table[i][-1] = row_known_sum  # Update the last value in each row

# Recalculate the column_known_sum after filling in the missing values
for j in range(m - 1):
    col_known_sum = sum(table[i][j] for i in range(n - 1))
    table[-1][j] = col_known_sum  # Update the last value in each column

# Write the output data
write_table('tabel.out', table)
```

This code properly calculates the missing values by using the already known row and column sums, then filling in the missing values for each row, and finally recalculating the row and column sums. It reads from 'tabel.in' and writes the output to 'tabel.out'.

The previous approach to filling the inner cells was incorrect. The essence of the problem is to calculate the missing values based on the information given in the last row and column, which are sums of the respective rows and columns. Since the last cell value (bottom right) is known and fixed, we can use it as a reference point. All other missing values can be derived from the intersection of their row and column sums.

Let's attempt to solve the problem with this approach:

1. First, fill in the known values from the input.
2. Use the known values in the last row and column to calculate the sums for other rows and columns.
3. Use these sums to deduce the missing values in the inner cells.
4. The last cell (bottom right) doesn't need to be changed as it's derived from the input.

Here's the implemented solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())
    
    # Initialize the table with zeros
    table = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Known sums for each row and column
    row_sums = [0] * (n - 1)
    col_sums = [0] * (m - 1)
    
    # Read the known values and fill the table
    for _ in range(p):
        row, col, value = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[row - 1][col - 1] = value
        # Update row and column sums if not in the last row or column
        if row < n:
            row_sums[row - 1] += value
        if col < m:
            col_sums[col - 1] += value

# Calculate the missing values in the table
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(m - 1):
        if table[i][j] == 0:  # Missing value
            # Deduce the missing value
            table[i][j] = table[i][m - 1] - row_sums[i]
            
            # Update the corresponding sums
            row_sums[i] += table[i][j]
            col_sums[j] += table[i][j]

# Now we need to fill in the last missing value in the inner table
# Since we have all the sums correct, it should match the last cell
last_missing_value = table[n - 1][m - 1] - sum(col_sums)
table[n - 2][m - 2] += last_missing_value
row_sums[n - 2] += last_missing_value
col_sums[m - 2] += last_missing_value

# Write output data
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as file:
    for row in table:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
```

This solution should correctly reconstruct the table based on the given constraints and the provided input values. It writes the reconstructed table to 'tabel.out' as desired.

The discrepancies between the expected and found output are due to faulty logic in computing the inner cell values. The current approach is not correctly handling the determination of the missing values based on the sums provided in the last row and column, and it is crucial to ensure that the computed values satisfy both the row sum and column sum constraints.

Here's an updated approach that should yield the correct result:

1. Initialize the table with zeros.
2. Read the known values into the table.
3. Determine the sum of known entries for each row and column, excluding the sums at the end.
4. Fill in the missing values by using the difference between the total sum and the sum of known values in the corresponding row or column.
5. The last value of each row and column is already known and should be used as a reference for calculating the missing values.

Let's write the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data.
with open('tabel.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    p = int(file.readline())
    # Initialize the table with zeros.
    table = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    # Read the known values.
    for _ in range(p):
        l, c, v = map(int, file.readline().split())
        table[l - 1][c - 1] = v

# Calculate the sums of known values in each row and column, excluding the last ones.
row_known_sums = [sum(row[:-1]) for row in table[:-1]]
col_known_sums = [sum(table[i][j] for i in range(n-1)) for j in range(m-1)]

# Fill in the missing values for the inner cells.
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(m - 1):
        if table[i][j] == 0:  # Missing value.
            # Calculate the missing value based on the row and column sums.
            table[i][j] = table[i][-1] - row_known_sums[i]
            # Update the known sums after filling the value.
            row_known_sums[i] += table[i][j]
            col_known_sums[j] += table[i][j]

# Write the output data.
with open('tabel.out', 'w') as file:
    for row in table:
        file.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in row) + '\n')
```

This solution initializes the table, reads the known values, calculates the sums of known values, infers the missing values, and then writes the completed table to 'tabel.out'. The implementation ensures compliance with the sum constraints given in the last row and column.
