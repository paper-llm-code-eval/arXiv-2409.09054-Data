Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `ucif.in` and write to `ucif.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

def compute_last_digit_of_series(n):
    # Since we only care about the last digit, we can use modulo 10 arithmetic
    # to keep our numbers small.
    last_digit = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        # Computing i to the power of i is potentially large, but modulo 10 
        # keeps the numbers small enough to avoid large memory usage.
        last_digit = (last_digit + pow(i, i, 10)) % 10
    return last_digit

# Read the input.
with open('ucif.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Compute the result.
last_digit = compute_last_digit_of_series(n)

# Write the output.
with open('ucif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(last_digit))
```
```

This code keeps memory usage low by only working with integers and taking advantage of the modulo operation to ensure that no large numbers need to be stored. The use of the built-in `pow` function with three arguments allows for efficient computation of large powers modulo 10. The solution reads from the specified input file and writes to the specified output file, without using `input()` or `print()` functions.

```markdown
```python
# Solution using numpy is unnecessary as we are only dealing with last digit calculations.
# Hence, we can implement the solution without numpy to ensure low memory usage.

def compute_last_digit_of_series(n):
    last_digit = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # The last digit of i^i is cyclic with a period that depends on i.
        # Since we're only interested in the last digit, we can use pow with modulo 10.
        last_digit = (last_digit + pow(i, i, 10)) % 10
    return last_digit

# Read the input from the file 'ucif.in'
with open('ucif.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())

# Compute the last digit of the series sum
last_digit = compute_last_digit_of_series(n)

# Write the output to the file 'ucif.out'
with open('ucif.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(last_digit))
```
```
This solution correctly implements the requirement to read from `ucif.in` and write to `ucif.out` file, and it uses an efficient approach to calculate the last digit by utilizing modular exponentiation. This avoids any unnecessary memory usage, adhering to the ~8MB memory limit.

Certainly, here's the revised solution without using `input()` or `print()`, which reads from `ucif.in` and writes the result to `ucif.out` using file I/O:

```python
def compute_last_digit_of_series(n):
    last_digit = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Use pow with modulo 10 to keep the calculation within the last digit.
        last_digit = (last_digit + pow(i, i, 10)) % 10
    return last_digit

# Read the input from the file 'ucif.in'
with open('ucif.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())

# Compute the last digit of the series sum
last_digit = compute_last_digit_of_series(n)

# Write the output to the file 'ucif.out'
with open('ucif.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(last_digit))
```

Make sure to place the `ucif.in` file with the input number in the same directory as the script before running it to ensure it reads the input correctly. Similarly, the `ucif.out` file will be created or overwritten in the same directory with the result.
