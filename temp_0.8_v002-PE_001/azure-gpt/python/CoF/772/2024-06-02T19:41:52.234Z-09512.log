Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python

    if num <= 3:

    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6

    digit_count = 0
    pth_term = None

    # Generate the series for the first n terms
    while len(sequence) < n:
        next_term = (sequence[-1] + sequence[-3]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)

        # Prime check and sum
        if is_prime(next_term):
            prime_sum += next_term

    # Count the occurrences of digit k
    digit_count = np.sum(np.char.count(np.array(sequence[:n], dtype=str), str(k)))

    # Calculate the pth term, if p is within precalculated range
    if p <= len(sequence):
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1]
    else:
        # Use the pattern that repeats every 15 terms for large p values
        repeating_sequence = sequence[3:]  # The sequence starting from index 3 repeats
        pth_term = repeating_sequence[(p - 4) % len(repeating_sequence)]

    return prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term

# Read from nr.in
with open('nr.in') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Perform calculations
prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term = calculate_values(n, k, p)

# Write to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{digit_count}\n{pth_term}\n")
```

This solution respects the memory constraint by breaking the problem into two main parts: calculation for n terms and pattern-based retrieval for large p indices. It uses NumPy for efficient digit counting and handles prime number identification with a straightforward method that minimizes the number of checks. The 15-term repeating pattern in the sequence is used to calculate large p values without storing the entire sequence.

The `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the script is being executed. As per the problem statement, we need to optimize for memory usage and should avoid using large libraries unless necessary. Given the constraints, we can implement the same functionality without using `numpy`.

Now, I'll rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other third-party libraries, only using Python's built-in functionalities to ensure it runs within the environment's restrictions.

```python
# markdown code block
# Define a function to check for prime numbers
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Define a function to generate the sequence and perform the required calculations
def calculate_values(n, k, p):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
    sequence.extend(sequence[-3:])  # Extend the sequence with its last three elements
    prime_sum = 10  # 2 + 3 + 5 (first three prime numbers in the sequence)
    digit_count = 0
    pth_term = None

    # Generate the series for the first n terms
    while len(sequence) < n:
        next_term = (sequence[-1] + sequence[-3]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)

        # Prime check and sum
        if is_prime(next_term):
            prime_sum += next_term

    # Count the occurrences of digit k
    digit_count = sum(str(x).count(str(k)) for x in sequence[:n])

    # Calculate the pth term, if p is within precalculated range
    if p <= len(sequence):
        pth_term = sequence[p - 1]
    else:
        # Use the pattern that repeats every 15 terms for large p values
        repeating_sequence = sequence[3:]  # The sequence starting from index 3 repeats
        pth_term = repeating_sequence[(p - 4) % len(repeating_sequence)]

    return prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term

# Read from nr.in
with open('nr.in') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Perform calculations
prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term = calculate_values(n, k, p)

# Write to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{digit_count}\n{pth_term}\n")
```

The updated solution implements the digit count operation using a list comprehension and sum function to iterate through the generated sequence and count occurrences of the specified digit `k`. This approach avoids the use of the numpy library and any other non-standard Python libraries, ensuring compatibility with a standard Python environment.

Upon reviewing the output differences, it is clear that the current solution is not correctly generating the series or calculating the sum of prime numbers and the count of the digit `k`. In the provided series, we can see a pattern that the series is generated by taking the sum of the last and third-to-last numbers modulo 10. However, the initial implementation incorrectly included the last three repeated numbers in the series and incorrectly handled the prime sums and digit counting.

Let's refine the algorithm by correctly identifying the pattern in the series generation and ensuring accurate prime number summation and digit counting. We will also verify the calculation of the pth term according to the pattern.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# markdown code block
# Define a function to check for prime numbers
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Define a function to generate the sequence and perform the required calculations
def calculate_values(n, k, p):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
    prime_sum = 2 + 3 + 5  # sum of prime numbers in the initial sequence
    digit_count = 0

    # Generate the series for the first n terms
    while len(sequence) < n:
        next_term = (sequence[-1] + sequence[-3]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)

        # Prime check and sum
        if is_prime(next_term):
            prime_sum += next_term

    # Count the occurrences of digit k
    digit_count = sum(1 for x in sequence[:n] if x == k)

    # Derive the repeating pattern and calculate the pth term
    repeating_pattern = sequence[2:17]  # Pattern starts from index 2 and repeats every 15 terms
    pth_index = (p - 3) % 15  # Adjusted index for the repeating pattern
    pth_term = repeating_pattern[pth_index]

    return prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term

# Read from nr.in
with open('nr.in') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Perform calculations
prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term = calculate_values(n, k, p)

# Write to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{digit_count}\n{pth_term}\n")
```

This solution takes into account the correct pattern for generating the sequence and only includes the numbers in the prime sum if they are indeed prime. It also counts the digit `k` accurately by comparing each number in the sequence to `k`. Lastly, it calculates the pth term using the deduced repeating pattern. This corrected approach should yield the expected results for the given input data.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it seems that the sum of prime numbers is incorrect in the given output. Additionally, the calculation of the pth term is incorrect. The expected output for the pth term (26th term) should be 8, but the provided output is 5.

The primary issue seems to be in the way we are generating the sequence and in the identification of the repeating pattern. We assumed the pattern repeats every 15 terms after the initial 5 terms based on the sequence provided, but this might not be correct. We have to find the actual repeating pattern and apply that to calculate the pth term.

Also, to sum up prime numbers, we may have made an error in identifying prime numbers or in the condition for adding them to the sum.

I will provide a corrected version of the program, ensuring that the pattern for generating the sequence is identified correctly and that the prime numbers are summed accurately, and that the pth term is calculated based on the correct repeating pattern.

```python
# markdown code block
# Define a function to check for prime numbers
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Define a function to generate the sequence and perform the required calculations
def calculate_values(n, k, p):
    sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
    prime_sum = 2 + 3 + 5  # sum of prime numbers in the initial sequence
    digit_count = 0

    # Generate the series for the first n terms
    while len(sequence) < n:
        next_term = (sequence[-1] + sequence[-3]) % 10
        sequence.append(next_term)
        
    # Calculate the prime sum and the digit k count in the sequence
    for term in sequence[:n]:
        if is_prime(term):
            prime_sum += term
        if term == k:
            digit_count += 1

    # Find the repeating pattern of length 60, which is the LCM of 10 (for the modulo operation) and the cycle length of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 (which is 60)
    repeating_pattern = sequence[2:62]  # The pattern repeats every 60 terms starting from the 3rd term
    pth_index = (p - 3) % 60  # Adjusted index for the repeating pattern
    pth_term = repeating_pattern[pth_index]

    return prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term

# Read from nr.in
with open('nr.in') as f:
    n, k, p = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Perform calculations
prime_sum, digit_count, pth_term = calculate_values(n, k, p)

# Write to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{prime_sum}\n{digit_count}\n{pth_term}\n")
```

This solution takes into account the correct sequence generation, prime number summation, and digit counting. It also correctly calculates the pth term by identifying the repeating pattern of the sequence. With these corrections, the solution should now match the expected output.
