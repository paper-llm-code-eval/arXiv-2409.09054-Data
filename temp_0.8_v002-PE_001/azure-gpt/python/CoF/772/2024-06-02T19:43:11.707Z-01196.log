The issue with the previous solution is in the way the p-term is calculated and how the digit count is done. The digit count should only count the occurrences of the digit `k` as a whole number, not as a part of numbers with more digits. The p-term calculation doesn't take into account the repeating pattern properly after the initial sequence.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Pre-compute the primes up to 9 since all elements in the sequence are single-digit numbers.
primes = [x for x in range(10) if is_prime(x)]

# Generate the sequence with the repeating pattern.
def generate_sequence(n):
    initial_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    if n <= len(initial_sequence):
        return initial_sequence[:n]
    sequence = initial_sequence[:]

    # The sequence repeats every 16 numbers after the initial sequence.
    repeating_sequence = sequence[1:17]  # The first 16 elements after the first number.
    for i in range(17, n):
        sequence.append(repeating_sequence[(i - 17) % 16])
    return sequence

# Read the input values from nr.in
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence up to the n-th term.
sequence = generate_sequence(n)

# Calculate the sum of primes within the first n terms.
sum_of_primes = sum(num for num in sequence if num in primes)

# Count the occurrences of digit k in the first n terms.
digit_count = sum(1 for num in sequence if num == k)

# Calculate the p-th term of the sequence.
# Since the sequence repeats every 16 numbers after the initial 17, we can find the p-th term with modulo.
p_term = sequence[p - 1] if p <= 17 else sequence[16 + (p - 17) % 16]

# Write the output values to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sum_of_primes}\n{digit_count}\n{p_term}\n")

The `IndexError` occurred because I attempted to access an index in the sequence list that does not exist. The `sequence` list only contains `n` elements, but `p` could be much larger than `n`. To resolve this, we should calculate the `p-th` term by directly using the repeating pattern logic without referencing the `sequence` list.

Let's fix the `p-th` term calculation and rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate the sequence with the repeating pattern.
def generate_sequence(n):
    initial_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    repeating_sequence = initial_sequence[1:] + [initial_sequence[0]]
    sequence = []
    for i in range(n):
        sequence.append(repeating_sequence[i % 16])
    return sequence

# Read the input values from nr.in
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence up to the n-th term.
sequence = generate_sequence(n)

# Calculate the sum of primes within the first n terms.
sum_of_primes = sum(num for num in sequence[:n] if is_prime(num))

# Count the occurrences of digit k in the first n terms.
digit_count = sequence[:n].count(k)

# Calculate the p-th term of the sequence.
# The p-th term can be calculated directly using the repeating pattern logic.
p_term = generate_sequence(p)[-1]

# Write the output values to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sum_of_primes}\n{digit_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution should now handle the calculation of the `p-th` term properly without running into an `IndexError`, and also corrects the digit count calculation by only counting the occurrences where the number is exactly equal to `k`.

Upon reviewing the expected vs. actual output, it's clear that there are mistakes in the sum of prime numbers and the p-th term calculation. The previous implementation incorrectly calculated the sum of primes by including all primes up to the n-th term, but it should only include primes present in the first n terms of the specific series. Additionally, for the p-th term, it appears the repeating pattern wasn't correctly identified. The repeating pattern actually includes 16 terms after the initial sequence (excluding the first term of the sequence).

To address these issues, we need to:
1. Correctly calculate the sum of primes by only summing up the prime numbers present in the sequence.
2. Properly identify the repeating pattern for the p-th term calculation.

Let's correct the solution accordingly:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# The sequence repeats every 16 numbers after the initial sequence.
# We can generate the sequence based on this pattern.
def get_sequence_term(index):
    initial_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    if index < len(initial_sequence):
        return initial_sequence[index]
    index = (index - len(initial_sequence)) % 16
    return initial_sequence[index + 1]

# Calculate the sum of primes within the first n terms.
def calculate_sum_of_primes(n):
    return sum(get_sequence_term(i) for i in range(n) if is_prime(get_sequence_term(i)))

# Count the occurrences of digit k in the first n terms.
def count_digit_k(n, k):
    return sum(1 for i in range(n) if get_sequence_term(i) == k)

# Read the input values from nr.in
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the requested values.
sum_of_primes = calculate_sum_of_primes(n)
digit_count = count_digit_k(n, k)
p_term = get_sequence_term(p - 1)

# Write the output values to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sum_of_primes}\n{digit_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution calculates the sum of primes and the p-th term by using a function that returns the correct sequence term based on the repeating pattern, which should lead to the correct results.

Upon further review, the previous solution still does not match the expected output. The count of digit `k` is incorrect, and the calculation of the p-th term seems to be off as well. It seems that the repeating pattern for generating the series was not correctly identified, which led to the discrepancy in the results.

Given the initial sequence and the repeating nature of the series, it's clear that the series can be defined as follows:
- The series starts with the initial sequence of 17 terms: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4].
- After the 17th term, each subsequent term repeats every 16 terms.

To correctly calculate the sum of primes, we need to iterate through the first `n` terms of the series, check if each term is prime, and then sum these prime terms. For the digit count, we need to iterate through the first `n` terms and count the number of times `k` appears as a term in the series. For the p-th term, we can calculate it based on the repeating pattern by using the modulo operation.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# The initial non-repeating sequence and the repeating sequence.
initial_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]

# Function to get the sequence term, accounting for the repeating pattern.
def get_sequence_term(index):
    if index < len(initial_sequence):
        return initial_sequence[index]
    # Adjust for zero-based index in the repeating part
    index = (index - len(initial_sequence)) % 16
    return initial_sequence[index + 1]

# Main program logic
# Read the input values from nr.in
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the sum of primes within the first n terms.
sum_of_primes = sum(get_sequence_term(i) for i in range(n) if is_prime(get_sequence_term(i)))

# Count the occurrences of digit k in the first n terms.
digit_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if get_sequence_term(i) == k)

# Calculate the p-th term of the series.
p_term = get_sequence_term(p - 1)

# Write the output values to nr.out
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sum_of_primes}\n{digit_count}\n{p_term}\n")
```

This solution should correctly calculate the sum of primes, count the digit occurrences, and find the p-th term, respecting the series's initial and repeating sequences.
