Certainly, the error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since we have a tight memory constraint and cannot rely on `numpy`, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` and use the built-in Python functionalities to minimize memory usage.

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):

            return False
    return True

            last_elements.append(new_element)
            last_elements.pop(0)
        return last_elements[-1]

The issue with the previous solution is in the `is_prime` function, which is not correctly evaluating prime numbers, and in the way we count the occurrences of digit `k` in the sequence elements. Also, the sequence generation process seems to be incorrect for the p-th element as the output does not match the expected result for the p-th element.

Let's correct these issues:

1. Rewrite the `is_prime` function to correctly identify prime numbers.
2. Correct the generation of the sequence to match the sequence pattern observed in the prompt.
3. Correct the count of digit `k` in the sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to generate a sequence up to n terms based on the observed pattern
def generate_sequence(n):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    for i in range(17, n):  # Start generating from the 18th element
        next_value = (seq[i - 16] + seq[i - 5]) % 10
        seq.append(next_value)
    return seq[:n]

# Load the numbers from the file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate sequence and calculate prime sum and k count
sequence = generate_sequence(n)
prime_sum = sum(num for num in sequence if is_prime(num))
k_count = ''.join(map(str, sequence)).count(str(k))

# Calculate p-th element, avoiding full sequence generation if possible
if p <= n:
    p_element = sequence[p - 1]
else:
    p_element = generate_sequence(p)[p - 1]

# Write the results to the output file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n")
    file.write(f"{k_count}\n")
    file.write(f"{p_element}\n")
```

This solution should now produce the expected output by correctly identifying prime numbers, counting the occurrences of the digit `k`, and generating the sequence with the correct pattern.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it is clear that the previous solutions did not correctly handle the generation of the sequence and counting of the digit `k`. The previous `is_prime` implementation also appears to have been incorrect, which resulted in an inaccurate sum of prime numbers.

Let's re-evaluate the sequence generation rule based on the given terms in the problem statement and correct the implementation:

1. The sequence generation seems to be based on taking the sum of the 5th last and the 16th last number, and then modulo 10 is applied.

2. Counting the digit `k` should consider the individual digits of each number in the sequence, not the joined string representation.

3. The prime checking function needs to be corrected to ensure accurate prime number detection.

Let's reconstruct the fixed solution:

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num == 2:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to get the p-th element in the sequence efficiently without full generation
def get_pth_element(p):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    if p <= 17:
        return seq[p - 1]
    for i in range(17, p):
        new_element = (seq[-16] + seq[-5]) % 10
        seq.append(new_element)
        if len(seq) > 16:
            seq.pop(0)  # Maintain the last 16 elements
    return seq[-1]

# Load the numbers from the file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence up to n terms and calculate the prime sum and k count
sequence = [get_pth_element(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
prime_sum = sum(filter(is_prime, sequence))
k_count = sum(1 for num in sequence if num == k)
p_element = get_pth_element(p)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n")
    file.write(f"{k_count}\n")
    file.write(f"{p_element}\n")
```

This solution explicitly calculates the p-th element only when necessary, avoiding generating the full sequence if `p` is greater than `n`. It also counts occurrences of `k` accurately by comparing each number in the sequence to `k` directly. The `is_prime` function has been fixed to correctly identify prime numbers. This should now provide the expected output.

After reviewing the previous solution and the differences in the outputs, it seems there's an error in the prime checking function, sequence generation, and counting of the digit `k`. Let's fix these issues step by step:

1. Prime checking: The previous implementation of `is_prime` seems to be fine, but let's confirm its correctness.

2. Sequence generation: The description of the sequence generation suggests that each term is the sum of the 5th and 16th previous terms, modulo 10. The previous implementation attempted to optimize by only keeping 16 elements, but to ensure correctness, let's recompute this logic from scratch.

3. Counting digit `k`: The counting of `k` in the previous solution counts the occurrences of `k` as a number, but the sequence consists of digits, so we should count the occurrences of `k` as a digit.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num == 2:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to generate the sequence up to n terms
def generate_sequence(n):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    while len(seq) < n:
        new_element = (seq[-16] + seq[-5]) % 10
        seq.append(new_element)
    return seq

# Function to get the p-th element in the sequence
def get_pth_element(seq, p):
    while len(seq) < p:
        new_element = (seq[-16] + seq[-5]) % 10
        seq.append(new_element)
    return seq[p - 1]

# Load the numbers from the file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence and calculate the prime sum and k count
sequence = generate_sequence(n)
prime_sum = sum(filter(is_prime, sequence))
k_count = ''.join(map(str, sequence)).count(str(k))
p_element = get_pth_element(sequence, p)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n")
    file.write(f"{k_count}\n")
    file.write(f"{p_element}\n")
```

This solution recalculates the entire sequence up to `n` terms to ensure we have an accurate sequence. It also calculates the p-th element based on the already computed sequence, extending it if necessary. The count of digit `k` is now done by converting the sequence to a string and counting the occurrences of the character representing `k`. This should now yield the expected output.

To address the differences between the expected and found result, I'll perform the following steps:

1. Re-evaluate the `is_prime` function. It appears the previous prime-checking function was correct, but let's double-check and use it as is.

2. Correctly generate the sequence up to `n` terms, ensuring the generation rule is properly applied: each new term is the sum of the 5th and 16th previous terms, modulo 10.

3. Correctly count the occurrences of the digit `k`. We need to count `k` as a single digit within each number of the sequence. We'll iterate over the sequence and convert each number to a string to count the occurrences of the digit `k`.

4. For calculating the `p`-th element, we must ensure that we're applying the same generation rule used for the first `n` elements.

Considering these steps, here's the revised solution:

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Function to generate the sequence up to n terms
def generate_sequence(n):
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4]
    for i in range(17, n):
        seq.append((seq[-16] + seq[-5]) % 10)
    return seq

# Function to get the p-th element in the sequence
def get_pth_element(n, p):
    if p <= n:
        return sequence[p - 1]
    p_seq = sequence.copy()
    for _ in range(n, p):
        p_seq.append((p_seq[-16] + p_seq[-5]) % 10)
    return p_seq[-1]

# Load the numbers from the file
with open('nr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k, p = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Generate the sequence and calculate the prime sum and k count
sequence = generate_sequence(n)
prime_sum = sum(num for num in sequence if is_prime(num))
k_count = sum(1 for num in sequence if str(k) in str(num))

# Calculate the p-th element
p_element = get_pth_element(n, p)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('nr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{prime_sum}\n")
    file.write(f"{k_count}\n")
    file.write(f"{p_element}\n")
```

This solution should work as expected. It processes the sequence generation and p-th element retrieval correctly, and counts the occurrences of digit `k` accurately.
