Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.

    num_digits = len(digits)

    # If the number of digits in N is less than A+B+C, return the smallest number with A c1's, B c2's, and C c3's
    if num_digits < total_digits:
        return int(''.join([str(c1)] * A + [str(c2)] * B + [str(c3)] * C))
    
    # If the number of digits in N is the same as A+B+C but N is not composed of the correct count of c1, c2, c3
    if num_digits == total_digits and not all(d in (c1, c2, c3) for d in digits):
        # Solution must therefore start with a digit higher than the current highest digit.
        return next_greater_number(N + 10 ** (num_digits - 1 - max(i for i, d in enumerate(digits) if d < max(c1, c2, c3))),

    target_digits = np.array([c1] * A + [c2] * B + [c3] * C, dtype=np.int8)
    target_digits.sort()

    # If N is already the correct number, just increment the smallest digit
    if np.array_equal(digits, target_digits):
        return N + min(c1, c2, c3)

    # Generate the next greater permutation of target_digits that is greater than N
    for i in range(num_digits - 1, -1, -1):
        # Find the smallest digit in the target_digits that is bigger than digits[i]
        larger_indices = np.where(target_digits > digits[i])[0]
        if larger_indices.size > 0:
            min_larger_index = larger_indices[0]
            # Swap
            target_digits[i], target_digits[min_larger_index] = target_digits[min_larger_index], digits[i]
            # Sort the remaining digits to get the smallest number
            target_digits[i + 1:] = np.sort(target_digits[i + 1:])
            break
    else:
        # If no such permutation exists start with a higher order of magnitude
        return next_greater_number(N + 10 ** (num_digits - 1 - max(i for i, d in enumerate(digits) if d < max(c1, c2, c3))),

```

Please note that this solution attempts to find the next greater number by comparing and arranging digits which could be more memory-efficient than generating all permutations. However, without an actual execution environment to validate against the 8MB memory limit, it is challenging to guarantee that this implementation strictly adheres to that constraint. The use of numpy and in-place operations on arrays seeks to minimize memory overhead.

The exit code 1 and the error message indicate that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment. Since the memory limit is strict and we must ensure the most efficient memory usage, it's sensible to avoid external libraries that might be memory-intensive and instead rely on built-in Python libraries and techniques that are memory efficient.

Given this, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` and only using built-in Python features, to ensure that the solution is memory efficient and can be executed in an environment without `numpy`.

Here is the revised solution without `numpy`:

```python
def next_greater_number(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3):
    # Convert N to array of its digits
    digits = list(map(int, str(N)))
    total_digits = A + B + C
    num_digits = len(digits)

    # If the number of digits in N is less than A+B+C, return the smallest number with A c1's, B c2's, and C c3's
    if num_digits < total_digits:
        return int(''.join([str(c1)] * A + [str(c2)] * B + [str(c3)] * C))
    
    # Create the target number with the correct count of c1, c2, c3
    target_digits = [c1] * A + [c2] * B + [c3] * C
    target_digits.sort()

    # If N is already the correct number, just increment the smallest digit
    if digits == target_digits:
        return N + min(c1, c2, c3)

    # Generate the next greater permutation of target_digits that is greater than N
    for i in range(num_digits - 1, -1, -1):
        # Find the smallest digit in the target_digits that is bigger than digits[i]
        larger_indices = [j for j, x in enumerate(target_digits) if x > digits[i]]
        if larger_indices:
            min_larger_index = larger_indices[0]
            # Swap
            target_digits[i], target_digits[min_larger_index] = target_digits[min_larger_index], digits[i]
            # Sort the remaining digits to get the smallest number
            target_digits[i + 1:] = sorted(target_digits[i + 1:])
            break
    else:
        # If no such permutation exists, add one more digit to N and try again
        return next_greater_number(N + 10 ** (num_digits - digits[::-1].index(min(digits))), A, B, C, c1, c2, c3)

    return int(''.join(map(str, target_digits)))

# Read from tcif.in
with open('tcif.in', 'r') as file:
    A, B, C, c1, c2, c3 = map(int, file.readline().split())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Write to tcif.out
with open('tcif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{solution}\n')
```

This revised solution should work in Python environments without any additional libraries and abide by the memory constraints. It uses the standard Python library to manipulate lists and strings to find the next greater number with the given constraints.

The result differs because the provided code incorrectly handles the scenario where the original number `N` is made up of the correct digits but not in the right order or quantity. Also, the logic for determining the next greater number with the exact digit counts is flawed. The algorithm needs to properly account for the ordering of the digits and ensure that the numbers composed of `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` indeed have the counts `A`, `B`, and `C`, respectively.

To address the issue, I will write a new function that builds the smallest possible number with the correct counts of `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, and then iteratively increase it until it's greater than `N`. This function should start with the highest digit (`c3`) at the most significant place and decrement when necessary to ensure the number is strictly greater than `N`. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def next_greater_combination(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3):
    # Generate the smallest number with the correct digit counts
    digits = [c1]*A + [c2]*B + [c3]*C
    digits.sort(reverse=True)  # Start with the highest digit on the left
    
    # Increment the number until it is greater than N
    while True:
        # Convert list of digits to integer
        num = int("".join(map(str, digits)))
        
        # If the number is greater than N, return it
        if num > N:
            return num
        
        # Find the rightmost digit that can be incremented
        for i in range(len(digits) - 1, -1, -1):
            if (digits[i] == c1 and A > 0) or (digits[i] == c2 and B > 0) or (digits[i] == c3 and C > 0):
                # Decrement the count of the current digit
                if digits[i] == c1:
                    A -= 1
                elif digits[i] == c2:
                    B -= 1
                else:
                    C -= 1
                
                # Increment the current digit to the next possible value
                if digits[i] == c1 and B > 0:
                    digits[i] = c2
                    B -= 1
                    A += 1
                elif digits[i] == c2 and C > 0:
                    digits[i] = c3
                    C -= 1
                    B += 1
                elif digits[i] == c3 and A > 0:
                    digits[i] = c1
                    A -= 1
                    C += 1
                
                # Reset all digits to the right to the smallest possible values
                digits[i+1:] = [c1]*A + [c2]*B + [c3]*C
                digits[i+1:].sort(reverse=True)
                break

# Read from tcif.in
with open('tcif.in', 'r') as file:
    A, B, C, c1, c2, c3 = map(int, file.readline().split())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Solve the problem

# Write to tcif.out
with open('tcif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{solution}\n')
```

This corrected solution should now correctly handle the ordering and counts of the digits to ensure the number found is the smallest number strictly greater than `N` with exactly `A` occurrences of `c1`, `B` occurrences of `c2`, and `C` occurrences of `c3`.

The result differs from the expected output because the revised code does not properly handle the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the algorithm does not correctly find the next greater number that maintains the exact counts of `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` while also being the smallest possible number meeting these criteria.

To address this, we must re-implement the algorithm with a correct approach. The key to this problem is to find the smallest lexicographically larger permutation of the required digits that is greater than `N`. If no such permutation exists with the same number of digits as `N`, we need to increase the number of digits.

We'll start with the smallest number composed of `A` `c1` digits, `B` `c2` digits, and `C` `c3` digits, and try to find the next greater permutation until we find one that's larger than `N`. If we can't find one, we'll increase the digit count.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Function to find the smallest number greater than N with given counts of c1, c2, c3
def next_greater_number(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3):
    # Convert N to a string since we will be comparing lexicographically
    N_str = str(N)

    # List all possible combinations that we need to check
    digits = [str(c1)] * A + [str(c2)] * B + [str(c3)] * C

    # Start with a very large number that cannot be the answer
    min_greater = '9' * (A + B + C + 1)

    # Generate all unique permutations of the digits
    for perm in set(permutations(digits, len(digits))):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        # If the candidate is greater than N and less than the current min_greater, update min_greater
        if N_str < candidate < min_greater:
            min_greater = candidate

    # If we haven't updated min_greater, then we need to use more digits
    if min_greater[0] == '9':
        digits.append(str(min(c1, c2, c3)))  # Append the smallest digit
        return ''.join(sorted(digits))  # The smallest number with one more digit

    return min_greater

# Read from tcif.in
with open('tcif.in', 'r') as file:
    A, B, C, c1, c2, c3 = map(int, file.readline().split())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Solve the problem
solution = next_greater_number(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3)

# Write to tcif.out
with open('tcif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{solution}\n')
```

This implementation checks all permutations of the given digits to find the smallest lexicographically greater number than `N`. If such a permutation does not exist with the same number of digits as `N`, it appends the smallest digit and returns the smallest number with one more digit. This approach ensures that the output will be the smallest number strictly greater than `N` with the exact counts of the provided digits.

The result differs from the expected output because the implementation does not correctly handle cases where the required number of digits is greater than the number of digits in `N`. When we need to make a number with more digits than `N`, the solution should always start with the smallest digit `c1`, `c2`, or `c3` placed at the highest digit, followed by the rest in ascending order. In the current example, the smallest digit is 0, so it should come first, followed by the rest.

Let's reimplement the solution with this logic:

```python
# Function to find the smallest number greater than N with given counts of c1, c2, c3
def next_greater_number(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3):
    # Convert N to a list of digits
    N_digits = list(map(int, str(N)))
    total_digits = A + B + C
    # Create the target number with the correct count of c1, c2, c3
    target_digits = [c1] * A + [c2] * B + [c3] * C
    # Sort the target digits to get the smallest possible number with those digits
    target_digits.sort()

    # If N has less digits than the target, then just return the target as the next number
    if len(N_digits) < total_digits:
        return int(''.join(map(str, target_digits)))

    # Helper function to check if we can form a number with remaining counts
    def can_form_number(remaining, current_digit):
        return sum(v for k, v in remaining.items() if k > current_digit) >= 1

    # Helper function to get the next digit
    def get_next_digit(remaining, current_digit):
        for digit in sorted(remaining.keys()):
            if digit > current_digit and remaining[digit] > 0:
                return digit
        return None

    # Start from the most significant digit of N and try to build up the next number
    for i in range(len(N_digits)):
        remaining_counts = {c1: A, c2: B, c3: C}
        for d in target_digits[:i]:
            remaining_counts[d] -= 1
        current_digit = N_digits[i]

        # Check if we can form a number with remaining counts
        if can_form_number(remaining_counts, current_digit):
            next_digit = get_next_digit(remaining_counts, current_digit)
            if next_digit is not None:
                # Build the next number
                target_digits[i] = next_digit
                remaining_counts[next_digit] -= 1
                following_digits = sorted([k for k, v in remaining_counts.items() for _ in range(v)])
                return int(''.join(map(str, target_digits[:i+1] + following_digits)))
        else:
            # If we cannot form the number with the remaining counts, reset the current digit and continue
            target_digits[i] = c1

    # If we cannot find a number by changing the digits of N, then we need to add an extra digit
    smallest_digit = min(c1, c2, c3)
    return int(str(smallest_digit) + ''.join(map(str, sorted(target_digits))))

# Read from tcif.in
with open('tcif.in', 'r') as file:
    A, B, C, c1, c2, c3 = map(int, file.readline().split())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Solve the problem

# Write to tcif.out
with open('tcif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{solution}\n')
```

This solution should now handle all cases correctly, including when the number of digits in the target is greater than in `N`, ensuring that the smallest digit is always placed at the highest digit when increasing the number of digits. It builds the target number incrementally, checking at each step if the remaining digits can form a valid number that is greater than `N`. If at any point it's not possible, it proceeds to add an extra digit.

The result differs from the expected output because the logic implemented for constructing the number that follows `N` isn't correctly considering the condition where the number of digits in `N` is less than the sum of `A`, `B`, and `C`. The function should then directly construct the smallest number with `A + B + C` digits using `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` in ascending order, starting with the smallest digit to ensure the result is greater than `N`.

Let's correct the solution by implementing the following logic:

1. If the total number of required digits (`A+B+C`) is greater than the number of digits in `N`, the smallest number greater than `N` will be the smallest digit repeated `A+B+C` times.
2. If `N` has the same number of digits as `A+B+C`, find the next greater permutation of the digits in `N`. If no greater permutation exists, then add one to the digit count and construct the smallest number with that digit count.
3. If `N` has more digits than `A+B+C`, the algorithm needs to handle this by incrementing the last digit of `N` and padding with the smallest digit to reach the required digit count.

Here is the new implementation:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Function to find the smallest number greater than N with given counts of c1, c2, c3
def next_greater_number(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3):
    digits = [str(c1)] * A + [str(c2)] * B + [str(c3)] * C
    N_str = str(N)
    if len(N_str) < A + B + C:
        # If N has fewer digits than the target, pad N with the smallest digit at the start
        N_str = ('0' * (A + B + C - len(N_str))) + N_str
    
    # Sort the digits to get the smallest permutation
    digits.sort()
    
    for perm in permutations(digits, len(digits)):
        perm_str = ''.join(perm)
        # Check if the permutation is greater than N
        if perm_str > N_str:
            # Remove leading zeros if any
            return int(perm_str.lstrip('0'))
    
    # If no greater permutation exists, add one to the digit count with the smallest digit at the front
    smallest_digit = min(c1, c2, c3)
    return int(str(smallest_digit) + ''.join(sorted(digits)))

The output is incorrect because the algorithm does not handle cases where the number of digits in `N` is less than the sum of `A+B+C`. In such a scenario, the correct approach is to construct the smallest number with `A+B+C` digits, starting with the smallest digit (`c1`, `c2`, or `c3`) followed by the remaining digits in ascending order. This ensures the constructed number is greater than `N`.

Additionally, the previous approach tried to use permutations to find the next number, but this is inefficient and not feasible for large digit counts due to the factorial time complexity.

Let's implement a new approach:

1. If `A+B+C` is greater than the number of digits in `N`, the smallest number greater than `N` can be constructed by ordering the digits starting with the smallest digit.

2. If `A+B+C` is equal to the number of digits in `N`, we need to find the smallest number greater than `N` with the same number of digits and the exact counts of `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`. This will involve finding the next permutation that satisfies these conditions.

3. If `A+B+C` is less than the number of digits in `N`, this scenario is not possible according to the problem constraints, as all digits of the number we are constructing must be either `c1`, `c2`, or `c3`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def next_greater_number(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3):
    # Construct a list with the correct counts of c1, c2, c3
    digits = [str(c1)] * A + [str(c2)] * B + [str(c3)] * C
    # Sort the list to get the smallest number from these digits
    digits.sort()

    # If the number of digits in N is less than A+B+C, prepend the smallest digit to reach the required length
    N_str = str(N)
    if len(N_str) < A + B + C:
        smallest_digit = min(c1, c2, c3)
        return int(''.join([str(smallest_digit)] + digits))

    # Helper function to find the next greater digit (if any) in the remaining list
    def find_next_greater(digit_list, current_digit):
        for d in digit_list:
            if d > current_digit:
                return d
        return None

    # Convert N to a list of its digits
    N_list = list(map(int, N_str))
    
    # Traverse the digits of N from right to left
    for i in range(len(N_list) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Find the next greater digit in the remaining digits
        next_greater = find_next_greater(digits, N_list[i])
        if next_greater is not None:
            # Replace the current digit with the next greater digit found
            index = digits.index(next_greater)
            N_list[i] = digits.pop(index)
            # Sort the remaining digits and combine them to form the result
            digits.sort()
            return int(''.join(map(str, N_list[:i+1] + digits)))
        
        # If no next greater digit is found, put the smallest digit back to the remaining list and continue
        digits.append(N_list[i])

    # If we reach here, no next greater number with the same number of digits is possible
    # So, prepend the smallest digit to form the next greater number with an additional digit
    smallest_digit = min(c1, c2, c3)
    return int(''.join([str(smallest_digit)] + sorted(digits)))

# Read from tcif.in
with open('tcif.in', 'r') as file:
    A, B, C, c1, c2, c3 = map(int, file.readline().split())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Solve the problem
solution = next_greater_number(N, A, B, C, c1, c2, c3)

# Write to tcif.out
with open('tcif.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{solution}\n')
```

This solution maintains a list of the remaining digits we have to use and properly handles the scenario where we need to construct a number greater than `N` with a different number of digits. It correctly appends the smallest digit to the front if necessary and ensures the rest of the digits form the smallest possible number.
