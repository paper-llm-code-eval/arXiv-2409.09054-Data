Fie $S$ un șir de caractere de lungime $N$ indexat de la 1. Pe un astfel de șir se definește  operația `swap`: se alege un indice $i$ ($1 \leq i < N$) și se interschimbă caracterele $S[i]$ și $S[i+1]$.

Numărul norocos corespunzător unui șir $S$ este egal cu numărul minim de operații `swap` ce trebuie efectuate succesiv pentru a obține cel puțin o subsecvență `bingo` în șirul $S$. Dacă subsecvența `bingo` apare în șirul inițial, numărul norocos este egal cu $0$.

# Cerință

Se dă un număr natural $T$ și $T$ șiruri de caractere. Să se determine pentru fiecare șir dat $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$), numărul său norocos. 

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `bingo.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural nenul $T$. Următoarele $T$ linii conțin fiecare câte un șir de caractere format doar din litere mici ale alfabetului englez.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `bingo.out` conține numerele norocoase determinate pentru fiecare dintre cele $T$ șiruri date. Acestea se vor afișa fiecare pe câte un rând, în ordinea în care șirurile sunt date în fișierul de intrare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq T \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $\sum_{i=1}^{T}|S_i| \leq 100 \ 000$, unde se notează cu $|S|$ numărul de caractere din șirul $S$;
* O subsecvență de lungime $L$ a unui șir de caractere $S$ reprezintă o succesiune de $L$ caractere aflate pe poziții consecutive în șirul $S$.
* Se garantează că fiecare șir citit conține cel puțin o dată fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $|S_i|=5$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$);
* Pentru $21$ de puncte, în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare exact o dată;
* Pentru $11$ puncte, $1 \leq T \leq 10$ și în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare de cel mult 10 ori;
* Pentru $51$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

It seems that the environment does not have the `numpy` module installed, which is why the code is resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`. As per the constraints of the challenge, we need to optimize the solution for both time and memory, and we have a strict memory limit. Since `numpy` is not available and we should optimize for memory usage, we can implement the solution without using `numpy` or any other third-party libraries altogether.

Here is the revised solution in pure Python, without the use of `numpy` or any other external libraries:

```python
# Function to calculate the minimum number of swaps for each string
def compute_min_swaps(s):
    target = "bingo"
    n = len(s)
    min_swaps = float('inf')  # Use float('inf') as a substitute for numpy's np.inf

    # Check all possible positions where "bingo" could start
    for start in range(n - 4):
        count_swaps = 0
        current_positions = []
        
        # Check if characters b, i, n, g, o are in order
        for char in target:
            found_index = s.find(char, start, n)  # Search for the character in the substring
            if found_index == -1:  # If character not found, break and try next position
                break
            count_swaps += found_index - start  # Swaps to bring this character to the correct position
            s = s[:start] + s[found_index] + s[start:found_index] + s[found_index+1:]  # Reflect the swap in the string
            start += 1  # Move to the next position
        
        if start == len(target):  # If we found all characters in order
            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, count_swaps)
    
    # Return 0 if 'bingo' is already present or if we cannot form 'bingo'
    return 0 if min_swaps == float('inf') else min_swaps

# Reading from 'bingo.in' and writing to 'bingo.out'
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as infile, open('bingo.out', 'w') as outfile:
    T = int(next(infile).strip())  # Read number of test cases
    
    for _ in range(T):
        S = next(infile).strip()  # Read string
        min_swaps = compute_min_swaps(S)
        outfile.write(f'{min_swaps}\n')
```

This revised solution should work within the given environment without causing a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

The current implementation has a logical error because it assumes that each character of the "bingo" sequence must be found in order in the string, starting from index `start`. However, it's possible that the characters appear in a different order, and we should account for the number of swaps needed to rearrange them to form "bingo". 

Additionally, the function `compute_min_swaps` incorrectly updates `start` within the loop body, which could cause it to skip over some possible starting positions.

Let's rewrite the `compute_min_swaps` function to search for the positions of each 'bingo' character in the string, and then calculate the number of swaps based on those positions.

```python
# Function to calculate the minimum number of swaps for each string
def compute_min_swaps(s):
    # Indices where each character in "bingo" is found
    indices = {char: [] for char in "bingo"}
    
    # Collect all indices for each character in "bingo"
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in indices:
            indices[char].append(i)
    
    # Calculate number of swaps for each permutation of indices
    def count_swaps(idx_list):
        swaps = 0
        for i in range(5):
            # Swaps needed to bring each character to the correct position
            swaps += abs(idx_list[i] - i)
            # Additional swaps needed to account for previous characters
            for j in range(i):
                if idx_list[j] <= idx_list[i]:
                    swaps += 1
        return swaps

    # Find the minimum number of swaps across all combinations
    min_swaps = float('inf')
    from itertools import product
    for perm in product(*[indices[char] for char in "bingo"]):
        # perm contains one possible set of indices for the characters in "bingo"
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, count_swaps(sorted(perm)))

    return min_swaps

# Reading from 'bingo.in' and writing to 'bingo.out'
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as infile, open('bingo.out', 'w') as outfile:
    T = int(next(infile).strip())  # Read number of test cases
    
    for _ in range(T):
        S = next(infile).strip()  # Read string
        min_swaps = compute_min_swaps(S)
        outfile.write(f'{min_swaps}\n')
```

This reimplementation collects the indices of each 'bingo' character first and then tries every combination of these indices to find the one that requires the fewest swaps to arrange. The `count_swaps()` function calculates the number of swaps required for each combination, taking into account the positions of previous characters. This should address the incorrect assumptions in the previous implementation and produce the correct output.

The current implementation incorrectly calculates the number of swaps by summing the absolute differences of the positions and adding extra swaps when previous characters are before the current ones. This approach does not correctly simulate the swapping process and can overestimate the number of required swaps.

A correct approach must simulate the process of moving each 'bingo' character to its correct position, tracking the actual number of swaps required to incrementally build the 'bingo' sequence. We must account for the positions of each character and how the sequence changes as we make swaps to arrange 'bingo'.

Let's rewrite the solution to correctly simulate the swapping process:

```python
# Function to calculate the minimum number of swaps for each string
def compute_min_swaps(s):
    min_swaps = float('inf')
    target = 'bingo'

    # Helper function to count swaps for one permutation of characters
    def count_swaps_for_permutation(permutation):
        chars_indices = [[i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == char] for char in permutation]
        min_swaps_perm = float('inf')
        for indices in product(*chars_indices):
            indices = list(indices)
            if sorted(indices) != indices:  # if indices are not in ascending order, it's not a valid permutation
                continue
            swaps = 0
            for i in range(4, -1, -1):  # start from last character and swap it to the correct position
                while indices[i] != i:
                    # swap with the previous character
                    indices[i], indices[i - 1] = indices[i - 1], indices[i]
                    swaps += 1
            min_swaps_perm = min(min_swaps_perm, swaps)
        return min_swaps_perm

    # Compute swaps for all permutations of 'bingo' characters to handle multiple occurrences
    from itertools import permutations
    for permutation in permutations(target):
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, count_swaps_for_permutation(permutation))

    return min_swaps

# Reading from 'bingo.in' and writing to 'bingo.out'
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as infile, open('bingo.out', 'w') as outfile:
    T = int(next(infile).strip())  # Read number of test cases
    for _ in range(T):
        S = next(infile).strip()  # Read string
        min_swaps = compute_min_swaps(S)
        outfile.write(f'{min_swaps}\n')
```

In this implementation, we consider all permutations of 'bingo' because there may be multiple occurrences of 'bingo' characters in different orders within the string. We also use a helper function `count_swaps_for_permutation` to count the swaps required for a given permutation of 'bingo' characters. We simulate the swapping process from the end of the 'bingo' sequence to the beginning, which ensures that each character is moved to its correct position with the minimum number of swaps. This should provide the correct output according to the given problem statement.

The issue here is that the `product` function from the `itertools` module is not imported, which is causing a `NameError` when we try to call it. The `itertools` module provides the `product` function, which is used for computing the Cartesian product of input iterables.

Let's fix the import and rewrite the entire solution with the necessary fix:

```python
from itertools import permutations, product

# Function to calculate the minimum number of swaps for each string
def compute_min_swaps(s):
    target = 'bingo'
    min_swaps = float('inf')

    # Get all indices for each character in the target
    indices = {}
    for char in target:
        indices[char] = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == char]

    # Check all combinations of indices for the target string
    for combination in permutations(target):
        # Initialize the swap counter for this combination
        combination_swaps = 0
        # Initialize the current positions of characters
        current_positions = [indices[char].pop(0) for char in combination]
        # Sort the positions of the characters in ascending order
        for i in range(5):
            # Position where the current character should be
            desired_pos = i
            # Position where the current character is
            actual_pos = current_positions[i]
            while actual_pos > desired_pos:
                # Find the character to swap with
                for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
                    if current_positions[j] < actual_pos:
                        # Swap the characters
                        current_positions[j], actual_pos = actual_pos, current_positions[j]
                        combination_swaps += 1
                        break
        # Check if this is the minimum swap combination
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, combination_swaps)

    return min_swaps

# Reading from 'bingo.in' and writing to 'bingo.out'
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as infile, open('bingo.out', 'w') as outfile:
    T = int(next(infile).strip())  # Read number of test cases
    
    for _ in range(T):
        S = next(infile).strip()  # Read string
        min_swaps = compute_min_swaps(S)
        outfile.write(f'{min_swaps}\n')
```

This script imports the necessary functions `permutations` and `product` at the start. It then calculates the minimum swaps by considering all permutations of the target sequence 'bingo' and uses the indices of the characters in the input string to simulate the swaps. It writes the result to the output file `bingo.out`. This should work correctly within the given problem constraints.
