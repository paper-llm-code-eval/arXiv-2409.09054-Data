Fie $S$ un șir de caractere de lungime $N$ indexat de la 1. Pe un astfel de șir se definește  operația `swap`: se alege un indice $i$ ($1 \leq i < N$) și se interschimbă caracterele $S[i]$ și $S[i+1]$.

Numărul norocos corespunzător unui șir $S$ este egal cu numărul minim de operații `swap` ce trebuie efectuate succesiv pentru a obține cel puțin o subsecvență `bingo` în șirul $S$. Dacă subsecvența `bingo` apare în șirul inițial, numărul norocos este egal cu $0$.

# Cerință

Se dă un număr natural $T$ și $T$ șiruri de caractere. Să se determine pentru fiecare șir dat $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$), numărul său norocos. 

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `bingo.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural nenul $T$. Următoarele $T$ linii conțin fiecare câte un șir de caractere format doar din litere mici ale alfabetului englez.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `bingo.out` conține numerele norocoase determinate pentru fiecare dintre cele $T$ șiruri date. Acestea se vor afișa fiecare pe câte un rând, în ordinea în care șirurile sunt date în fișierul de intrare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq T \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $\sum_{i=1}^{T}|S_i| \leq 100 \ 000$, unde se notează cu $|S|$ numărul de caractere din șirul $S$;
* O subsecvență de lungime $L$ a unui șir de caractere $S$ reprezintă o succesiune de $L$ caractere aflate pe poziții consecutive în șirul $S$.
* Se garantează că fiecare șir citit conține cel puțin o dată fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $|S_i|=5$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$);
* Pentru $21$ de puncte, în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare exact o dată;
* Pentru $11$ puncte, $1 \leq T \leq 10$ și în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare de cel mult 10 ori;
* Pentru $51$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

This solution reads strings from `bingo.in`, computes the minimum number of swaps needed to create a `bingo` substring using an optimized approach, and writes the results to `bingo.out`. The code uses NumPy to handle the array of results efficiently and avoids excessive memory consumption to stay within the ~8MB limit.

The exit code 1 and the error message indicate that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the program is being executed. Since the problem requires optimizing memory usage and prohibits using unnecessary memory which might result in an Out of Memory (OOM) issue, it would be better to avoid using `numpy` and use built-in Python data structures instead to ensure compatibility and respect memory constraints.

Here is an updated version of the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Function to find the minimum swaps needed to form the "bingo" subsequence
def min_swaps_to_form_bingo(s):
    # Pre-calculate the positions of b, i, n, g, o
    positions = {k: [] for k in 'bingo'}
    for index, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in positions:
            positions[char].append(index)

    min_swaps = float('inf')
    # Iterate over all possible positions of 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'o'
    for b_pos in positions['b']:
        for i_pos in positions['i']:
            for n_pos in positions['n']:
                for g_pos in positions['g']:
                    for o_pos in positions['o']:
                        # Ensure correct order 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'o'
                        if b_pos < i_pos < n_pos < g_pos < o_pos:
                            # Calculate the total number of swaps
                            swaps = (i_pos - b_pos - 1) + (n_pos - i_pos - 1) + (g_pos - n_pos - 1) + (o_pos - g_pos - 1)
                            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, swaps)
    return min_swaps if min_swaps != float('inf') else 0

# Read input, process data, and write output
def process_files(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as fin:
        T = int(fin.readline().strip())
        strings = [fin.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]

    # Calculate the minimum swaps for each string and store the results
    results = [min_swaps_to_form_bingo(s) for s in strings]

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as fout:
        for result in results:
            fout.write(f'{result}\n')

# Process the files
process_files('bingo.in', 'bingo.out')
```

This updated solution should work correctly without relying on any external libraries and should fit within the memory limitations.

The provided solution is not meeting the challenge requirements because it is only considering the first occurrence of each character in the sequence `bingo`. For some cases, it might be more efficient to use later occurrences of some characters to minimize the number of swaps. We need to find the best combination of indices for the characters `b`, `i`, `n`, `g`, `o` so that the number of swaps is minimized. 

Instead of iterating through all combinations of positions of `bingo` characters, we can use a more efficient approach. Since we need to find the minimum number of swaps, we can look for the earliest occurrence of `o` after the earliest occurrence of `g` after `n`, and so on. We move from right to left to ensure that we find the earliest possible occurrence of `o` that can be used to form `bingo`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of swaps to sequence 'bingo'
def calculate_swaps(s, char_order):
    # Initialize the last index to the end of the string
    last_idx = len(s)
    swap_count = 0
    
    # Go through each character in reverse 'bingo' order
    for char in char_order[::-1]:
        char_idx = s.rfind(char, 0, last_idx)
        
        # Calculate the number of swaps for the current character
        swap_count += last_idx - char_idx - 1
        
        # Update the last index to the current character index
        last_idx = char_idx
    
    return swap_count

# Process the input file and write to the output file
def process_files(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as fin:
        T = int(fin.readline().strip())
        strings = [fin.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]

    # Calculate the minimum swaps for each string to form 'bingo'
    results = [calculate_swaps(s, 'bingo') for s in strings]

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as fout:
        for result in results:
            fout.write('{}\n'.format(result))

# Process the files
process_files('bingo.in', 'bingo.out')
```

This solution should now provide the correct output by calculating the minimum number of swaps needed to form `bingo` in each given string. It uses the `rfind` method to find the rightmost occurrence of each character within the currently considered slice of the string, ensuring that it is forming the sequence in the correct order while minimizing swaps.

The issue with the previous solution is that it is incorrectly calculating the number of swaps by using the `rfind` method from the right to the left, which does not take into account the relative positions of the `bingo` characters that follow. We need to find the optimal positions of `b`, `i`, `n`, `g`, `o` in sequence and calculate the total number of swaps needed to bring them into the `bingo` order.

Let's fix the solution by finding the indices of each `bingo` character in the string and then calculating the number of swaps required to move them to form the `bingo` sequence. We'll do this by analyzing the distances between the characters and their final positions in the `bingo` sequence.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the minimum swaps needed to form the "bingo" subsequence
def min_swaps_to_form_bingo(s):
    # Find all indices for each character
    indices = {char: [] for char in "bingo"}
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in indices:
            indices[char].append(idx)

    min_swaps = float('inf')
    
    # Generate all valid index combinations for 'bingo'
    for b_idx in indices['b']:
        for i_idx in indices['i']:
            for n_idx in indices['n']:
                for g_idx in indices['g']:
                    for o_idx in indices['o']:
                        if b_idx < i_idx < n_idx < g_idx < o_idx:
                            # Calculate swap count for current combination
                            swaps = (i_idx - b_idx - 1) + (n_idx - i_idx - 1) + (g_idx - n_idx - 1) + (o_idx - g_idx - 1)
                            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, swaps)
                            
    return 0 if min_swaps == float('inf') else min_swaps

# Read input, process data, and write output
def process_files(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as fin:
        T = int(fin.readline().strip())
        strings = [fin.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]

    # Calculate the minimum swaps for each string and store the results
    results = [min_swaps_to_form_bingo(s) for s in strings]

    # Write the results to the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as fout:
        for result in results:
            fout.write(f'{result}\n')

# Process the files
process_files('bingo.in', 'bingo.out')
```

This implementation calculates all valid combinations of indices where `b`, `i`, `n`, `g`, `o` appear in that order and then for each combination, calculates the number of swaps needed. It keeps track of the minimum number of swaps across all combinations, which is the answer for each string. It then writes these results to the `bingo.out` file.
