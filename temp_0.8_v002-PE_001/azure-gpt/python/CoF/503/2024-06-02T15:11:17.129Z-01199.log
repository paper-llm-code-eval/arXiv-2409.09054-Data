Fie $S$ un șir de caractere de lungime $N$ indexat de la 1. Pe un astfel de șir se definește  operația `swap`: se alege un indice $i$ ($1 \leq i < N$) și se interschimbă caracterele $S[i]$ și $S[i+1]$.

Numărul norocos corespunzător unui șir $S$ este egal cu numărul minim de operații `swap` ce trebuie efectuate succesiv pentru a obține cel puțin o subsecvență `bingo` în șirul $S$. Dacă subsecvența `bingo` apare în șirul inițial, numărul norocos este egal cu $0$.

# Cerință

Se dă un număr natural $T$ și $T$ șiruri de caractere. Să se determine pentru fiecare șir dat $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$), numărul său norocos. 

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `bingo.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural nenul $T$. Următoarele $T$ linii conțin fiecare câte un șir de caractere format doar din litere mici ale alfabetului englez.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `bingo.out` conține numerele norocoase determinate pentru fiecare dintre cele $T$ șiruri date. Acestea se vor afișa fiecare pe câte un rând, în ordinea în care șirurile sunt date în fișierul de intrare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq T \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $\sum_{i=1}^{T}|S_i| \leq 100 \ 000$, unde se notează cu $|S|$ numărul de caractere din șirul $S$;
* O subsecvență de lungime $L$ a unui șir de caractere $S$ reprezintă o succesiune de $L$ caractere aflate pe poziții consecutive în șirul $S$.
* Se garantează că fiecare șir citit conține cel puțin o dată fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, $|S_i|=5$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$);
* Pentru $21$ de puncte, în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare exact o dată;
* Pentru $11$ puncte, $1 \leq T \leq 10$ și în fiecare șir $S_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq T$) fiecare caracter din mulțimea $\{b,i,n,g,o\}$ apare de cel mult 10 ori;
* Pentru $51$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

            positions[char].append(idx)
    
    # Initialize minimum swaps to a large number

    # Use itertools.product to find all possible combinations of b-i-n-g-o occurrences
    from itertools import product
    for b, i, n, g, o in product(*positions.values()):
        if b < i < n < g < o:
            # Calculate the total distance each character must move
            total_swaps = (i - b - 1) + (n - i - 1) + (g - n - 1) + (o - g - 1)
            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, total_swaps)
    
    return min_swaps if min_swaps != float('inf') else 0

# Read the input file
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read number of test cases
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read the T strings

# Calculate lucky numbers for each string
lucky_numbers = np.array([calculate_lucky_number(s) for s in strings])

# Write the output file
with open('bingo.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(f"{num}\n" for num in lucky_numbers)
```

This solution should be efficient enough to avoid memory overflows for the given constraints, as it iterates through all combinations of `bingo` character positions. The `product` function generates combinations on the fly, so it doesn't store all combinations in memory. Additionally, I've avoided unnecessary list creations and string concatenations, which can be memory-intensive.

The use of NumPy here is marginal as it's only used to store the array of lucky numbers to write to the file, but it ensures that the output is handled efficiently and avoids Python's list overhead.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment. Since the use of `numpy` is not essential for this solution, we can remove it and instead write the output directly using standard file writing operations. Let's rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other third-party libraries.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Code to solve the bingo challenge with memory and performance optimization

# Function to calculate the lucky number for a given string
def calculate_lucky_number(s):
    # Initialize positions of bingo characters
    positions = {c: [] for c in 'bingo'}
    # Populate positions
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in positions:
            positions[char].append(idx)
    
    # Initialize minimum swaps to a large number
    min_swaps = float('inf')
    
    # Use itertools.product to find all possible combinations of b-i-n-g-o occurrences
    from itertools import product
    for b, i, n, g, o in product(*positions.values()):
        if b < i < n < g < o:
            # Calculate the total distance each character must move
            total_swaps = (i - b - 1) + (n - i - 1) + (g - n - 1) + (o - g - 1)
            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, total_swaps)
    
    return min_swaps if min_swaps != float('inf') else 0

# Read the input file
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read number of test cases
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read the T strings

# Calculate lucky numbers for each string
lucky_numbers = [calculate_lucky_number(s) for s in strings]

# Write the output file
with open('bingo.out', 'w') as file:
    for num in lucky_numbers:
        file.write(f"{num}\n")
```

In this revised solution, we use a list to store the lucky numbers and write them directly to the file without relying on any third-party libraries like `numpy`. This should work correctly within the memory constraints and without causing the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

The initial implementation has an incorrect algorithm for calculating the minimum number of swaps needed to form the `bingo` subsequence. The output suggests that it fails to correctly identify the proper positioning of the 'bingo' characters and calculate the required swaps.

The algorithm should be redesigned to track the distances of the 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', and 'o' characters from their desired positions to create a 'bingo' subsequence and sum these distances to get the total number of swaps.

Here's the correct approach and the fixed implementation:

```python
# Function to calculate the lucky number for a given string
def calculate_lucky_number(s):
    # Desired order for bingo characters
    order = 'bingo'
    # Find the initial positions of the 'bingo' characters
    positions = {c: [] for c in order}
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in positions:
            positions[char].append(idx)
    
    # Initialize minimum swaps to a large number
    min_swaps = float('inf')
    
    # Generate all combinations of positions for each character in 'bingo'
    from itertools import product
    for pos in product(*(positions[char] for char in order)):
        # Ensure positions are in increasing order
        if all(pos[i] < pos[i + 1] for i in range(len(pos) - 1)):
            # Sum distances between current and final positions for each character
            swaps = sum(pos[i] - i for i in range(len(pos)))
            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, swaps)
    
    return min_swaps if min_swaps != float('inf') else 0

# Read the input file
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read number of test cases
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read the T strings

# Calculate lucky numbers for each string
lucky_numbers = [calculate_lucky_number(s) for s in strings]

# Write the output file
with open('bingo.out', 'w') as file:
    for num in lucky_numbers:
        file.write(f"{num}\n")
```

This implementation calculates the number of swaps as the sum of the distances that each character in the sequence 'bingo' must move to reach their final ordered position. It iterates over all possible combinations of positions of 'bingo' characters, ensuring that they are in increasing order and calculating the number of swaps for each combination to find the minimum.

This solution should match the expected output, as it correctly accounts for the ordering and the number of swaps required to achieve the 'bingo' subsequence.

It appears that the previous solution is still not correctly calculating the necessary swaps. The fundamental flaw is that it doesn't correctly calculate the distance that each character has to move. It also assumes that the characters will move directly to their target positions, which is not necessarily the case in the scenario where characters are interleaved.

One way to approach this problem is to find the indices of all 'bingo' characters, then calculate the number of swaps needed to get each character into the correct order. This requires careful consideration of the relative positions of the 'bingo' characters.

Here's an updated solution that should address these issues:

```python
# Function to calculate the lucky number for a given string
def calculate_lucky_number(s):
    # Order of 'bingo' characters
    bingo_order = 'bingo'
    # Store indices of all occurrences of 'bingo' characters
    indices = {char: [] for char in bingo_order}
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in indices:
            indices[char].append(idx)
    
    # Shortest distance to achieve a 'bingo' subsequence
    min_swaps = float('inf')
    
    # Generate all combinations of positions for each character in 'bingo'
    from itertools import product
    for combination in product(*(indices[char] for char in bingo_order)):
        # Calculate the number of swaps required to order this combination
        swaps = 0
        for i in range(len(combination)):
            # Find how far current element is from its correct position
            distance = combination[i] - i
            # Swap each character until it reaches the correct position
            swaps += abs(distance - swaps)
        
        # Update minimum swaps
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, swaps)
    
    # If we didn't find a valid combination, there are no swaps needed
    return 0 if min_swaps == float('inf') else min_swaps

# Read the input file
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline().strip())  # Read number of test cases
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read the T strings

# Calculate lucky numbers for each string
lucky_numbers = [calculate_lucky_number(s) for s in strings]

# Write the output file
with open('bingo.out', 'w') as file:
    for num in lucky_numbers:
        file.write(f"{num}\n")
```

In this solution, we first collect the indices of each 'bingo' character in the input string. Then, we use `itertools.product` to iterate over all possible combinations of those indices, representing different ways to select the 'bingo' characters from the string. For each combination, we calculate the number of swaps needed to order that combination into a 'bingo' subsequence and keep track of the minimum number of swaps found.

This solution should now correctly calculate the number of swaps needed to form a 'bingo' subsequence and should match the expected output.

It seems the algorithm still contains logical errors in calculating the number of swaps required to form the 'bingo' subsequence. A new approach must be taken to ensure correctness.

Let's now consider a correct strategy:

1. First, locate the indices of all instances of 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', and 'o' characters in the string.
2. We will then iterate through every permutation of these indices that respect the order of 'bingo'.
3. For each permutation, we will calculate the minimum number of swaps needed to bring the characters 'bingo' in order, without disturbing the relative order of the indices.

The number of swaps in step 3 can be calculated by finding how far the characters are from their correct position and swapping them with adjacent characters.

Here's the corrected solution applying a proper algorithm:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Function to calculate the lucky number for a given string
def calculate_lucky_number(s):
    # Find indices of 'bingo' characters
    indices = {char: [] for char in 'bingo'}
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in indices:
            indices[char].append(idx)
    
    # Helper function to count the number of swaps needed to sort the permutation
    def count_swaps(permutation):
        swaps = 0
        for i in range(5):
            for j in range(i + 1, 5):
                if permutation[i] > permutation[j]:
                    swaps += 1
        return swaps

    # Calculate the minimum number of swaps for all permutations
    min_swaps = float('inf')
    for perm in permutations(indices['b']):
        for perm_i in permutations(indices['i']):
            for perm_n in permutations(indices['n']):
                for perm_g in permutations(indices['g']):
                    for perm_o in permutations(indices['o']):
                        # Combine indices into a single permutation
                        combined_perm = list(zip(perm, perm_i, perm_n, perm_g, perm_o))
                        # Flatten the list of tuples and count the swaps needed to order them
                        flat_perm = [idx for tuple in combined_perm for idx in tuple]
                        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, count_swaps(flat_perm))
    
    return min_swaps

# Read the input file
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline().strip())
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]

# Calculate lucky numbers for each string
lucky_numbers = [calculate_lucky_number(s) for s in strings]

# Write the output file
with open('bingo.out', 'w') as file:
    for num in lucky_numbers:
        file.write(f"{num}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the number of swaps needed to form a 'bingo' subsequence and produce the expected output.

To solve the issue in the previous implementations, we need to come up with a new strategy that ensures correct calculation of the minimum number of swaps needed to obtain a 'bingo' subsequence. The steps we need to follow are:

1. Locate all occurrences of the characters 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'o'.
2. Iterate through all possible positions of these characters to form the 'bingo' subsequence.
3. Calculate the number of swaps needed for each permutation to determine the minimum number of swaps.

The number of swaps can be inferred by examining how many characters are out of place relative to each 'bingo' character and summing up the distances. 

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find all occurrences of a character in a string and return their indices
def find_indices(s, char):
    return [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == char]

# Function to calculate the minimum number of swaps required to get a 'bingo' subsequence
def calculate_lucky_number(s):
    # Dictionary to hold character indices
    char_indices = {char: find_indices(s, char) for char in 'bingo'}
    
    # Initialize the minimum number of swaps to a large value
    min_swaps = float('inf')

    # Iterate over all permutations of indices to find the minimum swaps needed
    for b in char_indices['b']:
        for i in char_indices['i']:
            for n in char_indices['n']:
                for g in char_indices['g']:
                    for o in char_indices['o']:
                        # Ensure the current permutation is in increasing order (valid 'bingo' sequence)
                        if b < i < n < g < o:
                            # Calculate the total number of swaps for this valid permutation
                            total_swaps = (i - b - 1) + (n - i - 1) + (g - n - 1) + (o - g - 1)
                            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, total_swaps)

    return min_swaps if min_swaps != float('inf') else 0

# Read the input file
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline().strip())  # Number of test cases
    strings = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Strings to process

# Calculate lucky numbers for each string and write the outputs
with open('bingo.out', 'w') as file:
    for s in strings:
        lucky_number = calculate_lucky_number(s)
        file.write(f"{lucky_number}\n")
```

This implementation ensures that the indices for each character from 'bingo' are used to form a valid subsequence (i.e., in the correct order). For each valid permutation, it calculates the number of swaps required to form the 'bingo' subsequence and updates the minimum number of swaps if a new minimum is found.

This should now provide the correct output.

It seems my previous solutions did not correctly calculate the minimum number of swaps to obtain a 'bingo' subsequence. Let's try a more straightforward approach without permutations, which should reduce complexity and yield the correct answer.

The objective is to find the 'bingo' subsequence with minimal swaps. We need to consider the best position for each letter ('b', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'o') such that the total distance they need to move is minimized. 

The strategy I will use for this solution is:

1. Find the index positions of each letter 'b', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'o' in the string.
2. For each possible 'bingo' subsequence:
   - Calculate the index positions where each of these characters would be if they were already in the 'bingo' order.
   - Calculate the total number of swaps needed to move each character to its correct position in the 'bingo' subsequence. 
3. Take the minimum total number of swaps over all possible 'bingo' subsequences.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the minimum number of swaps needed for a single 'bingo' subsequence
def swaps_to_order(indices):
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(1, len(indices)):
        swaps += indices[i] - indices[i-1] - 1
    return swaps

# Function to calculate the lucky number for a given string
def calculate_lucky_number(s):
    # Get the positions of 'bingo' characters
    positions = {c: [] for c in 'bingo'}
    for index, c in enumerate(s):
        if c in positions:
            positions[c].append(index)
    
    min_swaps = float('inf')
    # Iterate over all possible 'bingo' subsequences
    for b in positions['b']:
        for i in positions['i']:
            for n in positions['n']:
                for g in positions['g']:
                    for o in positions['o']:
                        if b < i < n < g < o:
                            # Calculate swaps needed for this specific 'bingo' ordering
                            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, swaps_to_order([b, i, n, g, o]))
    return min_swaps if min_swaps != float('inf') else 0

# Read the input file and process each string
with open('bingo.in', 'r') as file:
    T = int(file.readline().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        s = file.readline().strip()
        results.append(calculate_lucky_number(s))

# Write the results to the output file
with open('bingo.out', 'w') as file:
    for result in results:
