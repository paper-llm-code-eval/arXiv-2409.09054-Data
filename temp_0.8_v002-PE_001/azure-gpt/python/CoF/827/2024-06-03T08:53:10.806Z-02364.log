Se consideră un text memorat într-o matrice $M$, definită prin coordonatele colţului stânga sus $(x_1,y_1)$ şi coordonatele colţului dreapta jos $(x_2,y_2)$.     

Prin aplicarea unui algoritm de compresie, matricei $M$ i se asociază un şir de caractere, notat $C_M$.

Şirul de caractere $C_M$ este construit prin aplicarea următoarelor reguli:  

a) dacă matricea $M$ are o singură linie şi o singură coloană atunci $C_M$ conţine numai caracterul memorat în matrice
b) dacă toate elementele matricei sunt identice atunci întreaga matrice $M$ se comprimă şi $C_M$ este şirul $k + c$, unde $k$ reprezintă numărul de caractere din matrice, iar $c$ caracterul memorat
c) dacă matricea este formată din caractere diferite şi are cel puţin două linii şi două coloane atunci:
   - matricea este împărţită în $4$ submatrice $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ după cum este ilustrat în figura alăturată, unde coordonatele colţului stânga sus ale submatricei $A$ sunt $(x_1,y_1)$, iar coordonatele colţului dreapta jos sunt $(\lfloor \frac{x_2+x_1}{2} \rfloor, \lfloor \frac{y_2+y_1}{2} \rfloor)$
   - $C_M$ este şirul `*` $+\ C_A + C_B + C_C + C_D$, unde $C_A$, $C_B$, $C_C$, $C_D$ sunt şirurile de caractere obţinute, în ordine, prin compresia matricelor $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ utilizând acelaşi algoritm

~[2e2e22e2e.png]

d) dacă matricea este formată din caractere diferite, are o singură linie şi mai multe coloane atunci $C_M$ este şirul `*` $+\ C_A + C_B$, unde $A$, $B$, $C_A$, $C_B$ au semnificaţia descrisă la punctul c).
e) dacă matricea este formată din caractere diferite, are mai multe linii şi o singură coloană atunci $C_M$ este şirul `*` $+\ C_A + C_C$  unde $A$, $C$, $C_A$, $C_C$ au semnificaţia descrisă la punctul c).

# Cerinţă

Dat fiind şirul de caractere $C_M$ ce se obţine în urma aplicării algoritmului de compresie asupra unei matrice $M$ de dimensiune $N \cdot N$ să se determine: 

a) numărul de împărţiri care au fost necesare pentru obţinerea textului compresat
b) matricea iniţială din care provine textul compresat.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `ompresie.in` conţine pe prima linie un şir de caractere ce reprezintă textul compresat.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieșire `compresie.out` conţine:

* pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă  numărul $nr$ de împărţiri care au fost necesare pentru obţinerea textului compresat
* pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsesc câte $N$ caractere, litere mici ale alfabetului englez, neseparate prin spații, ce reprezintă, în ordine, liniile matricei iniţiale.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$
* $0 \leq nr \leq 1\ 000 \ 000$
* $2 ≤$ lungimea şirului compresat $≤ 1 \ 000 \ 000$
* Textul memorat iniţial în matricea $M$ conţine numai caractere din mulţimea literelor mici $\{$`a`$,$ `b`$, \dots,$ `z`$\}$.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei a) se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a ambelor cerinţe se acordă tot punctajul.

    return c.reshape((size, size)), num_divisions

            bottom = np.concatenate((C, D), axis=1)
            return np.concatenate((top, bottom), axis=0), idx, 1 + div_A + div_B + div_C + div_D
        elif rows == 1:
            half_cols = cols // 2
            A, idx, div_A = decompress_helper(s, idx + 1, 1, half_cols)
            B, idx, div_B = decompress_helper(s, idx, 1, cols - half_cols)
            return np.concatenate((A, B), axis=1), idx, 1 + div_A + div_B
        elif cols == 1:
            half_rows = rows // 2
            A, idx, div_A = decompress_helper(s, idx + 1, half_rows, 1)
            C, idx, div_C = decompress_helper(s, idx, rows - half_rows, 1)
            return np.concatenate((A, C), axis=0), idx, 1 + div_A + div_C

def read_number(s, idx):
    num_str = ''
    while s[idx].isdigit():
        num_str += s[idx]
        idx += 1
    return int(num_str), idx

# Read from file
with open('compresie.in', 'r') as file:
    compressed_string = file.readline().strip()

# Process the compressed string
size = int(np.sqrt(len(compressed_string.strip('*').replace('*', '')) // 2))  # Estimate matrix size
matrix, num_divisions = decompress(compressed_string, size)

# Write to file
with open('compresie.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_divisions}\n")
    for row in matrix:
        file.write("".join(row) + "\n")
```

This code should solve the problem within the given memory constraints. It recursively decompresses the matrix and constructs it using NumPy arrays, which are memory efficient. The estimated matrix size is derived from the length of the compressed string. The decompressing function counts the number of divisions performed during the reconstruction of the original matrix. The reconstructed matrix is then written to the output file in the specified format.

The exit code 1 along with the error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the execution environment where the code is running. Since the challenge constraint is to optimize the memory usage, and the standard Python library does not provide memory-efficient array handling like NumPy, we can't simply replace NumPy with lists or another data structure from the standard library.

However, as we can't use NumPy due to the `ModuleNotFoundError`, we will have to implement the solution using pure Python, ensuring that we optimize for memory efficiency. Here's an attempt to re-implement the solution without using NumPy or any other third-party library that may not be available in the environment:

```python
# Define helper functions
def decompress(s):
    size = int(len(s.strip('*').replace('*', '')) ** 0.5)
    matrix = [['' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    num_divisions, _ = decompress_helper(s, 0, (0, 0, size, size), matrix)
    return matrix, num_divisions

def decompress_helper(s, idx, bounds, matrix):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bounds
    if s[idx].isdigit():
        count, idx = read_number(s, idx)
        for i in range(x1, x2):
            for j in range(y1, y2):
                matrix[i][j] = s[idx]
        return 0, idx + 1
    elif s[idx] == '*':
        div_count = 0
        if x2 - x1 > 1 and y2 - y1 > 1:
            mx, my = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2
            div_count += 1
            subbounds = [(x1, y1, mx, my), (x1, my, mx, y2), (mx, y1, x2, my), (mx, my, x2, y2)]
            for sb in subbounds:
                d, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx + 1, sb, matrix)
                div_count += d
            return div_count, idx
        elif x2 - x1 == 1:
            my = (y1 + y2) // 2
            div_count += 1
            for sb in [(x1, y1, x2, my), (x1, my, x2, y2)]:
                d, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx + 1, sb, matrix)
                div_count += d
            return div_count, idx
        elif y2 - y1 == 1:
            mx = (x1 + x2) // 2
            div_count += 1
            for sb in [(x1, y1, mx, y2), (mx, y1, x2, y2)]:
                d, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx + 1, sb, matrix)
                div_count += d
            return div_count, idx

def read_number(s, idx):
    num = 0
    while s[idx].isdigit():
        num = num * 10 + int(s[idx])
        idx += 1
    return num, idx

# Read from file
with open('compresie.in', 'r') as file:
    compressed_string = file.readline().strip()

# Process the compressed string
matrix, num_divisions = decompress(compressed_string)

# Write to file
with open('compresie.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_divisions}\n")
    for row in matrix:
        file.write("".join(row) + "\n")
```

This code should now work without NumPy, using just Python's built-in data structures, and still manage to stay within the memory limit. The decompression logic remains similar to the previous implementation, but the matrix is stored as a nested list of characters.

The error message indicates that there's a `TypeError` because the function `decompress_helper` returned `None` instead of two values (a division count and an index) at some point. This happens because the return statement is not executed after processing each recursive call in all branches of the `decompress_helper` function.

To fix this issue, I need to ensure that every recursive call to `decompress_helper` correctly returns both the division count and the updated index.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Define helper functions
def decompress(s):
    size = int(len(s.strip('*').replace('*', '')) ** 0.5)
    matrix = [['' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    num_divisions, _ = decompress_helper(s, 0, (0, 0, size, size), matrix)
    return matrix, num_divisions

def decompress_helper(s, idx, bounds, matrix):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bounds
    if s[idx].isdigit():
        count, idx = read_number(s, idx)
        char = s[idx]
        for i in range(x1, x2):
            for j in range(y1, y2):
                matrix[i][j] = char
        return 0, idx + 1
    elif s[idx] == '*':
        div_count = 1
        idx += 1  # Skip the '*' character
        if x2 - x1 > 1 and y2 - y1 > 1:
            mx, my = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2
            subbounds = [(x1, y1, mx, my), (x1, my, mx, y2), (mx, y1, x2, my), (mx, my, x2, y2)]
        elif x2 - x1 == 1:
            my = (y1 + y2) // 2
            subbounds = [(x1, y1, x2, my), (x1, my, x2, y2)]
        elif y2 - y1 == 1:
            mx = (x1 + x2) // 2
            subbounds = [(x1, y1, mx, y2), (mx, y1, x2, y2)]
        else:
            # This case should not happen, but is here to prevent unexpected errors
            return 0, idx

        # Decompress each sub-matrix and accumulate the divisions
        for sb in subbounds:
            d, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, sb, matrix)
            div_count += d
        return div_count, idx

def read_number(s, idx):
    num = 0
    while s[idx].isdigit():
        num = num * 10 + int(s[idx])
        idx += 1
    return num, idx

# Read from file
with open('compresie.in', 'r') as file:
    compressed_string = file.readline().strip()

# Process the compressed string
matrix, num_divisions = decompress(compressed_string)

# Write to file
with open('compresie.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_divisions}\n")
    for row in matrix:
        file.write("".join(row) + "\n")
```

This fix ensures that the `decompress_helper` function properly returns the cumulative division count and the current index after each recursive call, so there should no longer be a `TypeError`. The program now should execute successfully and produce the correct output in `compresie.out`.

The error message remains the same, indicating an issue with the recursive calls in `decompress_helper` function. It sounds like the recursive call is hitting a branch that does not return anything (by default, Python functions return `None` if no explicit return value is provided), causing the unpacking to fail with a `TypeError`.

Let's carefully review the `decompress_helper` function and ensure that all branches return the expected two values: `div_count` and `idx`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Define helper functions
def decompress(s):
    size = int(len(s.strip('*').replace('*', '')) ** 0.5) * 2
    matrix = [['' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    num_divisions, _ = decompress_helper(s, 0, (0, 0, size, size), matrix)
    return matrix, num_divisions

def decompress_helper(s, idx, bounds, matrix):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bounds
    if s[idx] == '*':
        div_count = 1
        idx += 1  # Skip the '*' character
        # Calculate new bounds for splitting
        midx, midy = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2
        # Recursively decompress each quadrant or strip
        parts = [(x1, y1, midx, midy), (midx, y1, x2, midy), (x1, midy, midx, y2), (midx, midy, x2, y2)] if x2 - x1 > 1 and y2 - y1 > 1 else \
                [(x1, y1, x2, midy), (x1, midy, x2, y2)] if y2 - y1 > 1 else \
                [(x1, y1, midx, y2), (midx, y1, x2, y2)]
        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in parts:
            cnt, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, (x1, y1, x2, y2), matrix)
            div_count += cnt
        return div_count, idx
    else:
        # Read the number of characters and the character itself
        char_count, idx = read_number(s, idx)
        char = s[idx]
        idx += 1
        fill_matrix(matrix, x1, y1, x2, y2, char)
        return 0, idx

def fill_matrix(matrix, x1, y1, x2, y2, char):
    for i in range(x1, x2):
        for j in range(y1, y2):
            matrix[i][j] = char

def read_number(s, idx):
    num = 0
    while idx < len(s) and s[idx].isdigit():
        num = num * 10 + int(s[idx])
        idx += 1
    return num, idx

# Read from the input file
with open('compresie.in', 'r') as file:
    compressed_string = file.readline().strip()

# Decompress the string to get the matrix and number of divisions
matrix, num_divisions = decompress(compressed_string)

# Write the output to the file
with open('compresie.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_divisions}\n")
    for row in matrix:
        file.write("".join(row) + "\n")
```

This updated code includes a `fill_matrix` function that fills a specific region of the matrix with a given character. The `decompress_helper` function has been corrected to handle different cases properly: when splitting into quadrants, two horizontal strips, or two vertical strips, and when directly filling in the characters. Additionally, the `read_number` function has been modified to ensure it doesn't read beyond the string's length. This should prevent any `None` values from being returned inadvertently and fix the issue that caused the program to exit with code 1.

The issue with the previous code is incorrect matrix size calculation and the incorrect reconstruction of matrix content, which resulted in wrong output. To rectify this, we need to carefully handle the decompression by considering each character and asterisk `*` to reconstruct submatrices according to the given rules.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. The matrix size `N` should be the square root of the total number of characters minus asterisks (`*`), because each character represents a single cell in the matrix.
2. During the recursive decompression, we need to track the current bounds (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) of the submatrix we are filling.
3. We need to properly handle the splitting of the matrix into quadrants or strips, based on the presence of `*` and the current bounds.
4. We should count the number of divisions (`*` characters) during the decompression process.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
def decompress(s):
    # Determine the size of the matrix
    size = int(len(s.replace('*', '')) ** 0.5)
    matrix = [['' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    num_divisions, _ = decompress_helper(s, 0, (0, 0, size, size), matrix)
    return matrix, num_divisions

def decompress_helper(s, idx, bounds, matrix):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bounds
    if s[idx] == '*':
        idx += 1  # Skip the '*' character
        div_count = 1
        # Recursively decompress each quadrant or strip
        if x2 - x1 > 1 and y2 - y1 > 1:
            # Split into quadrants
            mx, my = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2
            parts = [(x1, y1, mx, my), (mx, y1, x2, my), (x1, my, mx, y2), (mx, my, x2, y2)]
        elif y2 - y1 > 1:
            # Split into horizontal strips
            my = (y1 + y2) // 2
            parts = [(x1, y1, x2, my), (x1, my, x2, y2)]
        elif x2 - x1 > 1:
            # Split into vertical strips
            mx = (x1 + x2) // 2
            parts = [(x1, y1, mx, y2), (mx, y1, x2, y2)]
        else:
            # It should not come to this case with the current problem constraints (N >= 2)
            return 0, idx

        for part in parts:
            cnt, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, part, matrix)
            div_count += cnt
        return div_count, idx
    else:
        # Read the number of characters and the character itself
        char_count, idx = read_number(s, idx)
        char = s[idx]

This solution follows the problem's rules for decompressing the matrix. The `decompress_helper` function is now fixed to handle different cases correctly: when splitting into quadrants, horizontal strips, or vertical strips, and when directly filling in the characters. This should now correctly reconstruct the matrix and match the expected result.

The result differs from the expected output because the recursive decompression logic is still incorrect. The logic for calculating matrix size and the order of processing submatrices are flawed. 

In the previous attempt, I incorrectly assumed that the size of the matrix is the square root of the length of the compressed string without asterisks, multiplied by 2. However, that is not correct according to the problem description. 

Additionally, the recursion logic is not handling the submatrices correctly according to the rules a through e of the problem. Specifically, it seems that the matrix splitting logic is not correct, and the recursive calls are not correctly processing the quadrants.

Let's attempt to fix the implementation according to the rules:

1. The size of the matrix is not provided explicitly but has to be deduced from the compressed string. Since the matrix is `NxN`, and each leaf in the compression represents one character, we can estimate `N` as the square root of the number of leaves (characters) in the compressed string. We need to make sure to count the leaves correctly.

2. The recursive function needs to handle asterisks correctly, splitting the matrix into appropriate quadrants or strips as required.

3. We need to keep track of the divisions as we go through the compressed string.

Here is the corrected solution, considering the points mentioned above:

```python
def decompress(compressed_string):
    # Compute the size of the original matrix N x N
    leaves = [c for c in compressed_string if c not in ('*', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0')]
    size = int(len(leaves) ** 0.5)
    matrix = [['' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    num_divisions, _ = decompress_helper(compressed_string, 0, (0, 0, size, size), matrix)
    return matrix, num_divisions

def decompress_helper(s, idx, bounds, matrix):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bounds
    if s[idx].isdigit():
        count, idx = read_number(s, idx)
        char = s[idx]
        for i in range(x1, x2):
            for j in range(y1, y2):
                matrix[i][j] = char
        return 0, idx + 1
    elif s[idx] == '*':
        idx += 1  # Skip the '*' character
        div_count = 1
        # Calculate midpoint for splitting
        midx, midy = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2
        # Recursively fill submatrices
        if x2 - x1 > 1 and y2 - y1 > 1:
            # Quadrants
            quadrants = [(x1, y1, midx, midy), (midx, y1, x2, midy), (x1, midy, midx, y2), (midx, midy, x2, y2)]
        elif y2 - y1 > 1:
            # Horizontal strips
            quadrants = [(x1, y1, x2, midy), (x1, midy, x2, y2)]
        elif x2 - x1 > 1:
            # Vertical strips
            quadrants = [(x1, y1, midx, y2), (midx, y1, x2, y2)]
        else:
            # This should not happen as the compressed string should not have '*' for a single character
            return 0, idx
        for qx1, qy1, qx2, qy2 in quadrants:
            cnt, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, (qx1, qy1, qx2, qy2), matrix)
            div_count += cnt
        return div_count, idx

def read_number(s, idx):
    num = 0
    while idx < len(s) and s[idx].isdigit():
        num = num * 10 + int(s[idx])
        idx += 1
    return num, idx 

# Read from the input file
with open('compresie.in', 'r') as file:
    compressed_string = file.readline().strip()

# Decompress the string to get the matrix and number of divisions
matrix, num_divisions = decompress(compressed_string)

# Write the output to the file
with open('compresie.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_divisions}\n")
    for row in matrix:
        file.write("".join(row) + "\n")
```

This code should now properly decompress the given compressed string into the original matrix and provide the correct number of divisions as required by the problem statement.

The error message indicates that the recursive `decompress_helper` function is returning a `None` value instead of a tuple with the division count and the updated index. This error usually occurs when we reach a code path that doesn't include a return statement; when the function completes without hitting a return, Python defaults to returning `None`.

This indicates that there may be an error in the logic or control flow of the `decompress_helper` function, where it fails to return the expected values in all cases.

Let's revise the code and ensure that every branch and recursive call within the `decompress_helper` function has a proper return statement, returning both the division count and the updated index:

```python
def decompress_helper(s, idx, bounds, matrix):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bounds
    div_count = 0  # Initialize division count

    while idx < len(s) and s[idx] != '*':
        char_count, idx = read_number(s, idx)
        char = s[idx]
        idx += 1  # Move past the character itself
        # Fill the current bounds with the character
        for i in range(x1, x2):
            for j in range(y1, y2):
                matrix[i][j] = char
        div_count += 1 if char_count > 1 else 0  # Count a division if needed

    if idx < len(s) and s[idx] == '*':
        div_count += 1  # Count the division for the asterisk
        idx += 1  # Move past the asterisk
        midx, midy = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2
        
        # Determine the next bounds and make recursive calls
        if x2 - x1 > 1 and y2 - y1 > 1:
            # Split into quadrants
            A_bounds = (x1, y1, midx, midy)
            B_bounds = (midx, y1, x2, midy)
            C_bounds = (x1, midy, midx, y2)
            D_bounds = (midx, midy, x2, y2)
            
            div_A, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, A_bounds, matrix)
            div_B, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, B_bounds, matrix)
            div_C, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, C_bounds, matrix)
            div_D, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, D_bounds, matrix)
            
            # Sum the divisions from submatrices
            div_count += div_A + div_B + div_C + div_D
        
        elif y2 - y1 > 1:
            # Split into horizontal strips
            top_bounds = (x1, y1, x2, midy)
            bottom_bounds = (x1, midy, x2, y2)
            
            div_top, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, top_bounds, matrix)
            div_bottom, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, bottom_bounds, matrix)
            
            div_count += div_top + div_bottom
        
        elif x2 - x1 > 1:
            # Split into vertical strips
            left_bounds = (x1, y1, midx, y2)
            right_bounds = (midx, y1, x2, y2)
            
            div_left, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, left_bounds, matrix)
            div_right, idx = decompress_helper(s, idx, right_bounds, matrix)
            
            div_count += div_left + div_right

    return div_count, idx  # Ensure we return division count and index

# Other functions remain unchanged

# Main execution
with open('compresie.in', 'r') as file:
    compressed_string = file.readline().strip()

matrix, num_divisions = decompress(compressed_string)

with open('compresie.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_divisions}\n")
    for row in matrix:
        file.write("".join(row) + "\n")
```

With these changes, the `decompress_helper` function now correctly returns the number of divisions and the index after processing each character or recursing into submatrices. This should fix the bug that led to the `TypeError` and ensure that the decompression correctly reconstructs the original matrix.
