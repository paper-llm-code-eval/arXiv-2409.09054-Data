“Arrows” este un joc care se joacă pe o tablă dreptunghiulară a cărei suprafață este împărțită în $N \cdot M$ celule, aranjate pe $N$ linii și $M$ coloane. În fiecare celulă se află o săgeată (sus, jos, stânga sau dreapta), ca în figura de mai jos:

~[arrows.png]

Când este la mutare, un jucător poate alege o poziție de start pe care plasează un jeton, apoi deplasează jetonul la celula învecinată în sensul indicat de săgeată. Deplasarea continuă până când jetonul părăsește tabla de joc, caz în care jucătorul obține un punctaj egal cu numărul de celule parcurse de jetonul său.
Există însă poziții de start denumite favorabile, pentru care jetonul **nu** va părăsi niciodată tabla de joc. De exemplu, toate pozițiile din figură cu fundal gri sunt favorabile. Jucătorul care alege o poziție de start favorabilă obține un punctaj egal cu numărul de celule distincte vizitate înmulțit cu $1000$.

Scrieți un program care, cunoscând configurația tablei de joc, rezolvă una dintre următoarele cerințe:

1. determină punctajul pe care îl obține un jucător care plasează jetonul său pe o poziție de start specificată;
2. determină numărul de celule favorabile de pe tabla de joc;
3. determină punctajul maxim pe care jucătorul îl poate obține la o mutare, alegând convenabil poziția de start.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arrows.in` conține pe prima linie cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1, 2$ sau $3$). Pe a doua linie se află numerele naturale $N \ M$, care reprezintă numărul de linii și respectiv de coloane de pe tabla de joc. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se află câte $M$ numere din mulțimea {$1,2,3,4$} reprezentând săgețile aflate în celulele de pe tabla de joc ($1$ semnificând săgeata la dreapta, $2$ săgeata în sus, $3$ săgeata la stânga și $4$ săgeata în jos). Pe ultima linie sunt scrise numerele naturale $lin \ col$, reprezentând linia și coloana pe care se află poziția de start specificată. Valorile scrise pe aceeași linie în fișierul de intrare sunt separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `arrows.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul pentru cerința specificată pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N, M \leq 500$;
* Liniile sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, iar coloanele de la $1$ la $M$.
* Pentru teste valorând $20$ de puncte cerința este $1$. Pentru teste valorând $40$ de puncte cerința este $2$. Pentru celelalte teste, valorând de asemenea $40$ de puncte, cerința este $3$.

This Python code should be saved as `arrows.py` and executed to read from `arrows.in` and write to `arrows.out`. It uses numpy for efficient array allocation and minimal memory usage. Each task is implemented through a specific function, and the main function controls the flow of the program depending on the task number specified in the input file.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which means that the Python environment where the code is executed does not have the `numpy` library installed. Since the original instructions emphasized the importance of optimizing for both time and memory usage and suggested using `numpy`, we may have to adjust the solution to not rely on external libraries.

Here's the adjusted solution that does not use `numpy` or any other external libraries:

```python
# arrows.py

directions = [(0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0)]

        data = file.readlines()
    return data

def write_result(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def get_next(pos, direction):
    return pos[0] + directions[direction - 1][0], pos[1] + directions[direction - 1][1]

def is_inside(pos, n, m):

        visited.add(pos)
        score += 1
        pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
    return score

def task2(board, n, m):
    visited = set()
    fav_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if (i, j) not in visited:
                cycle = set()
                pos = (i, j)
                while is_inside(pos, n, m) and pos not in visited:
                    visited.add(pos)
                    cycle.add(pos)
                    pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
                if is_inside(pos, n, m):
                    fav_count += len(cycle)

    task_number = int(data[0])
    n, m = map(int, data[1].split())
    board = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in data[2:-1]]
    result = 0

    if task_number == 1:
        start_line, start_col = map(int, data[-1].split())
        start_pos = (start_line - 1, start_col - 1)
        result = task1(board, start_pos, n, m)
    elif task_number == 2:

        result = task3(board, n, m)
    
    write_result('arrows.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution uses only the standard Python libraries and should work in any Python 3 environment without requiring additional packages. The board is now a list of lists instead of a numpy array, which should still be memory efficient for the constraints given in the problem.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates there is likely an issue with the way the program is calculating the number of favorable cells. Let's analyze the `task2` function to understand why it would return `24` instead of the expected `23`. 

One potential issue could be the condition for determining whether a cell is part of a cycle. The current implementation assumes that if we revisit a cell, we must be in a cycle. However, we're not checking if the cycle starts within the cells we started exploring from - it is possible that we hit a cycle that was already visited by starting from a different cell.

To fix this, we can modify the `task2` function to not only track visited cells but also track the cells that are part of a cycle. If we revisit a cell and that cell is already marked as part of a cycle, we should not count it again. Let's rewrite the `task2` function to fix this issue:

```python
def task2(board, n, m):
    visited = set()
    cycle_cells = set()
    fav_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if (i, j) not in visited and (i, j) not in cycle_cells:
                path = []
                pos = (i, j)
                while is_inside(pos, n, m) and pos not in visited:
                    visited.add(pos)
                    path.append(pos)
                    pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
                if pos in path:  # Check if we hit a cell that's in the current path
                    cycle_start_index = path.index(pos)
                    cycle = set(path[cycle_start_index:])  # Get the unique cells in the cycle
                    fav_count += len(cycle)
                    cycle_cells.update(cycle)
    return fav_count

# The rest of the code remains the same
```

Now, let's rewrite the entire solution with this updated `task2` function:

```python
# arrows.py
# Directions (right, up, left, down)
directions = [(0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0)]

def get_next(pos, direction):
    return pos[0] + directions[direction - 1][0], pos[1] + directions[direction - 1][1]

    while is_inside(pos, n, m):
        if pos in visited:
            return len(visited) * 1000
        visited.add(pos)
        score += 1
        pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
    return score

def task2(board, n, m):
    visited = set()
    cycle_cells = set()
    fav_count = 0
    for i in range(n):

            if (i, j) not in visited and (i, j) not in cycle_cells:
                path = []
                pos = (i, j)
                while is_inside(pos, n, m) and pos not in visited:
                    visited.add(pos)
                    path.append(pos)
                    pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
                if pos in path:  # Check if we hit a cell that's in the current path
                    cycle_start_index = path.index(pos)
                    cycle = set(path[cycle_start_index:])  # Get the unique cells in the cycle
                    fav_count += len(cycle)
                    cycle_cells.update(cycle)
    return fav_count

def task3(board, n, m):
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            max_score = max(max_score, task1(board, (i, j), n, m))
    return max_score

def main():
    data = load_data('arrows.in')
    task_number = int(data[0])
    n, m = map(int, data[1].split())
    board = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in data[2:-1]]
    result = 0

    if task_number == 1:
        start_line, start_col = map(int, data[-1].split())
        start_pos = (start_line - 1, start_col - 1)
        result = task1(board, start_pos, n, m)
    elif task_number == 2:

It seems there is still a problem with the solution. The updated algorithm may have introduced another issue. In the `task2` function, we are now adding the entire path to the visited set, including those cells that are not part of the cycle. This could cause some cells that should be revisited as part of a different path (and potentially counted as part of a different cycle) to be skipped.

To fix this, we should only mark a cell as visited if it is outside the current path or if it is the start of a cycle. Let's adjust the `task2` function once more to account for this:

```python
def task2(board, n, m):
    visited = set()
    fav_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if (i, j) not in visited:
                path = []
                pos = (i, j)
                while is_inside(pos, n, m) and pos not in path:
                    path.append(pos)
                    pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
                if pos in path:  # Check if we hit a cell that's in the current path
                    cycle_start_index = path.index(pos)
                    cycle = path[cycle_start_index:]  # Get the cells in the cycle
                    fav_count += len(set(cycle))  # Count unique cells only
                visited.update(path)  # Mark all path cells as visited
    return fav_count

# The rest of the code remains the same
```

Let's rewrite the entire solution with this updated `task2` function:

```python
# arrows.py
# Directions (right, up, left, down)
directions = [(0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0)]

    return fav_count

        for j in range(m):
            max_score = max(max_score, task1(board, (i, j), n, m))
    return max_score

def main():

    result = 0

    if task_number == 1:

        start_pos = (start_line - 1, start_col - 1)

This version should correctly count the number of unique cells in favorable positions, taking into account different paths that could lead to the same cycle. It should now produce the expected output for the given input data.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests that the code is not correctly identifying and handling cycles. This could be because the code is not precisely distinguishing between cells that lead to exiting the board and cells that lead to a cycle.

Let's revise the `task2` function to keep track of the cells visited for each start cell separately. When a cell is revisited within the same path, we have detected a cycle. In this case, we should count only the cells that are part of the cycle (without counting cells visited before the cycle starts). Additionally, we must ensure that we only count each cell in a cycle once, even if it can be reached by different paths.

Here is the corrected `task2` function and the complete solution:

```python
def task2(board, n, m):
    visited_global = set()  # Track all visited cells
    cycle_cells = set()  # Track cells that are part of any cycle
    fav_count = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if (i, j) not in visited_global:
                visited_local = set()  # Track visited cells for the current starting cell
                path = []  # Keep track of the path to detect cycles
                pos = (i, j)
                while is_inside(pos, n, m) and pos not in visited_local:
                    visited_local.add(pos)
                    path.append(pos)
                    pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
                if pos in visited_local:  # Cycle detected
                    cycle_index = path.index(pos)  # Find where the cycle starts
                    cycle = set(path[cycle_index:])  # Cells that form the cycle
                    fav_count += len(cycle - cycle_cells)  # Count non-duplicated cycle cells
                    cycle_cells.update(cycle)  # Add cycle cells to the global set
                visited_global.update(visited_local)  # Mark all path cells as globally visited

    return fav_count

# Rest of the code remains unchanged

# Main function
def main():
    data = load_data('arrows.in')
    task_number = int(data[0])
    n, m = map(int, data[1].split())
    board = [[int(direction) for direction in line.split()] for line in data[2:n+2]]

    result = 0
    if task_number == 1:
        start_i, start_j = map(int, data[-1].split())
        result = task1(board, (start_i - 1, start_j - 1), n, m)
    elif task_number == 2:
        result = task2(board, n, m)
    elif task_number == 3:
        result = task3(board, n, m)

    write_result('arrows.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated version of the code should correctly identify cells that are part of a cycle and ensure that each cell in a cycle is only counted once, regardless of how many times it is visited starting from different positions. It should now produce the correct output for task 2.

The error message indicates that `load_data` is not defined, which means that the function `load_data` is not present in the code snippet provided. This is a critical issue, as we need to read the input from the file `arrows.in`. I will now provide the complete and corrected code solution with all necessary function definitions and corrections.

Here is the complete Python code that addresses the previous issues and includes the definition for `load_data`:

```python
# Directions (right, up, left, down)
directions = [(0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0)]

def load_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        data = file.readlines()
    return data

def write_result(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def get_next(pos, direction):
    return pos[0] + directions[direction - 1][0], pos[1] + directions[direction - 1][1]

def is_inside(pos, n, m):
    return 0 <= pos[0] < n and 0 <= pos[1] < m

def task1(board, start, n, m):
    visited = set()
    pos = start
    score = 0
    while is_inside(pos, n, m):
        if pos in visited:
            return len(visited) * 1000
        visited.add(pos)
        score += 1
        pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
    return score

def task2(board, n, m):
    visited_global = set()
    cycle_cells = set()
    fav_count = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if (i, j) not in visited_global:
                visited_local = set()
                path = []
                pos = (i, j)
                while is_inside(pos, n, m) and pos not in visited_local:
                    visited_local.add(pos)
                    path.append(pos)
                    pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])
                if pos in visited_local:
                    cycle_index = path.index(pos)
                    cycle = set(path[cycle_index:])
                    fav_count += len(cycle - cycle_cells)
                    cycle_cells.update(cycle)
                visited_global.update(visited_local)

    return fav_count

def task3(board, n, m):
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            max_score = max(max_score, task1(board, (i, j), n, m))
    return max_score

def main():
    data = load_data('arrows.in')
    task_number = int(data[0])
    n, m = map(int, data[1].split())
    board = [[int(direction) for direction in line.split()] for line in data[2:n+2]]

    result = 0
    if task_number == 1:
        start_i, start_j = map(int, data[-1].split())
        result = task1(board, (start_i - 1, start_j - 1), n, m)
    elif task_number == 2:
        result = task2(board, n, m)
    elif task_number == 3:
        result = task3(board, n, m)

    write_result('arrows.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code provides all the necessary functions and logic to read from `arrows.in`, process the data according to the specified task, and write the result to `arrows.out`. The `load_data` function is defined at the beginning to read the input file, and the `write_result` function is used to write the output file. The `task1`, `task2`, and `task3` functions are responsible for solving the respective tasks mentioned in the problem statement. The `main` function orchestrates the program flow based on the task number.

The issue still seems to be with the cycle detection logic in `task2`. The expected number of favorable cells is 23, but the program is outputting 20. This suggests that some cells that are part of a cycle are being missed.

Let's re-evaluate the `task2` code. For every starting cell, we're checking if it leads to exiting the board or if it starts a cycle. However, it seems that the current approach might not be handling cases where paths merge into a previously discovered cycle correctly. Additionally, when a cycle is detected, we should make sure that we're only counting cells that have not been counted before. 

Here's an updated version of the `task2` function that uses a dictionary to keep track of the starting point of each cycle along with the length of the cycle. This will help us avoid double-counting cells that are part of the same cycle starting from different positions. Also, we need to ensure that if a cell is revisited and is not part of the current path, it's not a cycle for this path and we should continue.

```python
def task2(board, n, m):
    visited = set()  # Global visited set to keep track of all visited cells
    cycle_starts = {}  # Dictionary to keep track of cycle starting points and their lengths

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if (i, j) not in visited:
                local_visited = set()  # Local visited set for the current starting cell
                pos = (i, j)
                path = []  # Keep track of the current path to detect cycles

                while is_inside(pos, n, m) and pos not in local_visited:
                    local_visited.add(pos)
                    path.append(pos)
                    pos = get_next(pos, board[pos[0]][pos[1]])

                # If the current position is in the local visited set, a cycle is detected
                if pos in local_visited:
                    cycle_start = path.index(pos)
                    cycle = tuple(sorted(path[cycle_start:]))  # Sort to ensure uniqueness
                    if cycle not in cycle_starts:
                        cycle_starts[cycle] = len(cycle)

                # Update the global visited set
                visited.update(local_visited)

    # Sum all unique cycle lengths
    total_favorable_cells = sum(cycle_starts.values())

    return total_favorable_cells

# The rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By using this updated approach, we ensure that only unique favorable cells (cells that are part of a cycle) are counted, and we handle merging paths correctly. This should fix the discrepancy and match the expected output. Let's use this updated `task2` function in the complete solution:

```python
# The complete solution with the updated task2 function

# Note: All other functions and the logic in the `main()` function from the last provided solution remain the same.

def main():
    data = load_data('arrows.in')
    task_number = int(data[0])
    n, m = map(int, data[1].split())
    board = [[int(direction) for direction in line.split()] for line in data[2:n+2]]

    result = 0
    if task_number == 1:
        start_i, start_j = map(int, data[-1].split())
        result = task1(board, (start_i - 1, start_j - 1), n, m)
    elif task_number == 2:
        result = task2(board, n, m)
    elif task_number == 3:
        result = task3(board, n, m)

    write_result('arrows.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This should now give the correct output of 23 for the given input data, as it correctly identifies all the cells that are part of unique cycles.
