Împăratul cel bătrân vrea să împartă sacii cu galbeni din vistieria palatului celor $K$ feciori ai săi, numerotați de la $1$ la $K$ în ordinea vârstei. Feciorul cu numărul $1$ este cel mai mare, iar mezinul are numărul $K$.

În vistierie sunt $N$ saci plini cu galbeni, așezați în linie, atât de grei încât nu li se poate schimba ordinea, iar pe fiecare sac este scris numărul de galbeni pe care îi conține.
\
Împăratul îl cheamă pe unul dintre feciori și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_1$ saci!”. Feciorul ia sacii și pleacă fericit. Apoi, împăratul cheamă alt fecior și îi spune: „Fiule, a ta este averea primilor $x_2$ saci dintre cei rămași!”. Și așa mai departe, până ajunge la ultimul fecior chemat, căruia îi dă toți sacii rămași.

El nu are o ordine anume în care își cheamă feciorii dar are grijă să cheme fiecare fecior exact o dată. Totodată, pentru a evita certurile între ei, este atent ca fiecare fecior să primească cel puțin un sac cu galbeni, dar **să NU primească în total mai mulți galbeni ca un frate mai mare decât el**. Cel mai mic dintre feciorii împăratului este și cel mai viteaz, așa că împăratul ar vrea să îi dea lui o sumă de bani cât mai mare, fără a-i supăra pe ceilalți feciori ai săi.

# Cerință
Cum ar putea împărți împăratul sacii?

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `mostenire.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ și $K$, separate de un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se găsește câte un număr natural, reprezentând numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac, în ordinea în care aceștia urmează să fie distribuiți fiilor.

# Date de ieșire
Fișierul de ieșire `mostenire.out` va conține pe prima linie suma de galbeni pe care o va primi fiul cel mic de la împărat. Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al feciorului, respectiv numărul de saci $x_i$ pe care îi primește acesta, în ordinea în care au fost chemați de împărat.

# Restricții și precizări
- $2 \leq K \leq 100$
- $K \leq N \leq 100\ 000$
- Numărul de galbeni din fiecare sac va fi între $1$ și $100\ 000$.
- Galbenii din oricare dintre saci nu pot fi împărțiți mai multor frați.
- Numărul total de galbeni aflați în vistierie este mai mic sau egal cu $10^9$.
- Împăratul cel bătrân nu are doi feciori cu aceeași vârstă.
- **Puteți afișa orice soluție în care mezinul primește numărul maxim posibil de galbeni**.
- Pentru fiecare test, afișarea corectă a numărului maxim de galbeni primiți de mezin este notată cu $40\%$ din punctajul alocat testului.
- Pentru teste valorând 10 puncte, $N = K$ și $N \leq 100$.
- Pentru teste valorând 30 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 15$.
- Pentru teste valorând 50 de puncte, $2 \leq K < N \leq 100$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# markdown code block for the solution
import numpy as np

# Read input from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = np.array([int(file.readline()) for _ in range(N)], dtype=np.int64)

# Initialize the result variables
inheritance = np.zeros(K, dtype=np.int64)
sons_order = np.zeros(K, dtype=np.int64)

# Calculate the maximum sum that the youngest son can inherit
max_sum = np.sum(sacks[-K:])

def find_inheritance(start, end, sons_left):
    # Base case: when there's only one son left
    if sons_left == 1:
        return [(sons_left, end - start)]
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum the current son can inherit
    max_inherit = max_sum
    for i in range(start+1, end - sons_left + 2):
        current_sum = np.sum(sacks[start:i])
        remaining_sum = find_inheritance(i, end, sons_left - 1)
        if remaining_sum and current_sum <= max_inherit and current_sum >= remaining_sum[-1][1]:
            return [(sons_left, i - start)] + remaining_sum
    return None

# Find the inheritance distribution
inheritance_distribution = find_inheritance(0, N, K)

# Sort the inheritance distribution based on the son's order
sorted_inheritance_distribution = sorted(inheritance_distribution, key=lambda x: x[0])

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_sum}\n")
    for son_number, sacks_inherited in sorted_inheritance_distribution:
        file.write(f"{son_number} {sacks_inherited}\n")
```

To explain what this code does:

1. The input is read from `mostenire.in` into a numpy array called `sacks`, which contains the number of gold coins in each sack.
2. We initialize two numpy arrays: `inheritance` to keep track of the number of coins each son inherits and `sons_order` to keep track of the order in which the sons are called.
3. The function `find_inheritance` is a recursive function that attempts to find a valid way to distribute the inheritance starting from a given `start` index in the `sacks` array to an `end` index, considering the `sons_left` sons that need to inherit.
4. If the base case of `find_inheritance` is reached (only one son is left), it returns the remaining sacks to this son.
5. If there are more sons left, `find_inheritance` tries to find a suitable number of sacks for the current son that respects the condition that no younger son inherits more than an older son.
6. The inheritance distribution is then sorted based on the son's order.
7. Finally, the results are written to `mostenire.out`, first writing the sum that the youngest son will inherit, followed by the order of sons and the number of sacks they inherit.

This code aims to be both time and memory efficient by using numpy for array operations and avoiding unnecessary copying of arrays. However, depending on the specific constraints of the challenge (e.g., large input size, complex inheritance rules), further optimization might be necessary.

The exit code and standard error indicate that the `numpy` module is not found, which means it's not installed in the environment where the program is being run. To fix the program, we can eliminate the dependency on `numpy` and use native Python data structures instead.

Here's the revised solution without `numpy`:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate the maximum sum that the youngest son can inherit
max_sum = sum(sacks[-K:])

def find_inheritance(start, end, sons_left):
    # Base case: when there's only one son left
    if sons_left == 1:
        return [(sons_left, end - start)]
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum the current son can inherit
    max_inherit = max_sum
    for i in range(start + 1, end - sons_left + 2):
        current_sum = sum(sacks[start:i])
        remaining_sum = find_inheritance(i, end, sons_left - 1)
        if remaining_sum and current_sum <= max_inherit and current_sum >= remaining_sum[-1][1]:
            return [(sons_left, i - start)] + remaining_sum
    return None

# Find the inheritance distribution
inheritance_distribution = find_inheritance(0, N, K)

# Sort the inheritance distribution based on the son's order
sorted_inheritance_distribution = sorted(inheritance_distribution, key=lambda x: x[0])

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_sum}\n")
    for son_number, sacks_inherited in sorted_inheritance_distribution:
        file.write(f"{son_number} {sacks_inherited}\n")
```

This version of the code uses built-in Python functions and data structures to accomplish the same goal as the original version that used `numpy`. It reads the input data into a list called `sacks`, calculates the sum of sacks that the youngest son can inherit, finds the inheritance distribution through recursion, sorts the distribution, and finally writes it to the output file. The code should still meet the requirements of being time and memory efficient within the constraints of the challenge.

The result differs from the expected output because the algorithm is incorrect. The algorithm is trying to distribute the inheritance in a way that respects the condition of younger sons not receiving more than the older ones, but it fails to ensure that the youngest son receives the maximum amount possible. The current implementation recursively distributes the inheritance without considering the correct distribution order that maximizes the youngest son's share.

To fix this, we should distribute the inheritance in the following way:
1. The youngest son (son K) should receive as many of the rightmost (and biggest, since they are sorted in ascending order) sacks as possible without exceeding the total sum that any of the older sons receive.
2. Every other son, starting from the one just older than the youngest son and moving up to the oldest, receives one sack at a time since any older son must not inherit less than a younger one.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline()) for _ in range(N)]

# Function to calculate distribution
def calculate_distribution(N, K, sacks):
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]

    # Initialize the dynamic programming table
    for i in range(1, N - K + 2):
        dp[1][i] = sum(sacks[:i])

    # Fill in the DP table
    for i in range(2, K + 1):
        for j in range(i, N - K + i + 1):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + sacks[j-1])

    # Backtrack to find the distribution
    distribution = []
    remaining = N
    for i in range(K, 0, -1):
        while dp[i][remaining] == dp[i][remaining-1]:
            remaining -= 1
        distribution.append((i, remaining - (i - 1)))
        remaining -= (distribution[-1][1] - 1)

    # Reverse to get the order from oldest to youngest son
    distribution.reverse()

    return sum(sacks[-distribution[-1][1]:]), distribution

# Calculate the distribution
max_sum, distribution = calculate_distribution(N, K, sacks)

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_sum}\n")
    for son_number, sacks_inherited in distribution:
        file.write(f"{son_number} {sacks_inherited}\n")
```

This solution uses a dynamic programming approach to find the correct distribution of sacks. The `calculate_distribution` function creates a DP table `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of gold coins that the `i`th son can inherit when considering the first `j` sacks. The algorithm then backtracks from the DP table to get the correct distribution from the oldest to the youngest son.

Upon re-evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it becomes clear that the previous dynamic programming approach did not correctly satisfy the requirements of the problem. The approach did not ensure that the youngest son received the maximum possible number of gold coins while also respecting the constraint that no younger son should inherit more than an older one. The solution distributed the sacks incorrectly, whereby the youngest son did not receive the maximal sum possible.

To meet the requirements, we should implement a greedy strategy that allocates the maximum possible inheritance to the youngest son first and then distributes the remaining sacks to the older sons in such a way that each older son inherits at least as much as the younger one. This can be achieved by allocating sacks from the right end of the array for the youngest son and then working towards the left for the older sons, giving each son at least one sack.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Allocate sacks to sons, starting with the youngest
allocations = [1] * K  # Initially, assign one sack to each son
remaining_sacks = N - K  # Remaining sacks after initial allocation
youngest_son_index = K - 1

# Allocate remaining sacks to the youngest son
while remaining_sacks > 0 and youngest_son_index > 0:
    allocations[youngest_son_index] += 1
    remaining_sacks -= 1
    # Ensure that no younger son inherits more than an older one
    if allocations[youngest_son_index] > allocations[youngest_son_index - 1]:
        youngest_son_index -= 1

# Calculate the sum for the youngest son
youngest_sum = sum(sacks[-allocations[-1]:])

# Prepare output data
output_lines = [f"{youngest_sum}\n"]
sack_index = 0  # To keep track of from which sack we are allocating
for son_index, allocation in enumerate(allocations, start=1):
    output_lines.append(f"{son_index} {allocation}\n")
    sack_index += allocation

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(output_lines)
```

This implementation reads the sacks into a list, initializes an allocation list with one sack per son, and then greedily allocates the remaining sacks to the youngest son while respecting the constraints. It then writes the sum for the youngest son and the allocations for each son to the output file. The result should now match the expected output, ensuring that the youngest son receives the maximum sum of gold coins that respects the constraints.

The output differs from the expected result because the greedy algorithm I used still does not correctly respect the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the algorithm did not manage to give the youngest son (son number 3) the maximum number of sacks (4 in total, with a sum of 10 gold).

A proper approach to solving this problem is to ensure that we maximize the inheritance of the youngest son while also respecting the rule that no younger son receives more than an older one. To achieve this, we should allocate sacks in descending order of their gold content (rightmost sack first) to the youngest son, and then distribute the remaining sacks among the older brothers, ensuring that each of them receives at least as much gold as the younger brother.

Let's implement this algorithm:

```python
# Function to find the best division
def best_division(sacks, N, K):
    low = 0
    high = min(N // K, sacks[-1])  # The maximum that can be given to each child

    # Binary search to find the maximum sum that can be given to the youngest
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        children = K
        total = 0
        for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
            if total + sacks[i] <= mid:
                total += sacks[i]
            else:
                children -= 1
                total = sacks[i]
                if children == 0:
                    break
        if children > 0:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid

    # Now we distribute sacks starting from the youngest
    youngest_sum = low
    children = K
    total = 0
    sacks_needed = 0
    answer = []

    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        if total + sacks[i] <= youngest_sum:
            total += sacks[i]
            sacks_needed += 1
        else:
            answer.append((children, sacks_needed))
            children -= 1
            sacks_needed = 1
            total = sacks[i]
    answer.append((children, sacks_needed))

    return youngest_sum, answer[::-1]  # Reverse to start from the oldest

# Read input from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate the best division
youngest_sum, division = best_division(sacks, N, K)

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{youngest_sum}\n")
    for son in division:
        file.write(f"{son[0]} {son[1]}\n")
```

This algorithm uses a binary search to find the largest sum that can be given to the youngest son while respecting the constraints of the problem. It then distributes the sacks starting from the youngest, ensuring that each son receives at least as much as the younger one. Finally, it writes the results to the output file. The solution should now match the expected output.

It appears that the algorithm still doesn't properly satisfy the problem's constraints, and the implementation of the binary search and subsequent distribution is incorrect. The unexpected negative values in the output and the incorrect sum indicate that the logic for distributing the sacks is flawed.

Let's rework the solution using a different approach. Since we need to ensure that the youngest son receives as much inheritance as possible, we can use a greedy approach to allocate the sacks from the end (largest values) while maintaining the constraint that no younger son receives more than an older one. We do this by first ensuring that each son receives at least one sack and then distributing the remaining sacks starting from the youngest son.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Sort the sacks to ensure we distribute the largest sacks first
sacks.sort()

# Initialize distribution array with zero sacks for each son
distribution = [0] * K

# Each son must receive at least one sack
remaining_sacks = N - K

# Distribute the remaining sacks starting with the youngest son
for i in range(K - 1, -1, -1):
    # Give one sack to the current son
    distribution[i] += 1
    
    # If there are remaining sacks, give as many as possible to the youngest son
    if i == K - 1 and remaining_sacks > 0:
        distribution[i] += remaining_sacks
        remaining_sacks = 0

# Calculate the sum for the youngest son
youngest_sum = sum(sacks[-distribution[-1]:])

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{youngest_sum}\n")
    start_index = 0
    for son_number, sacks_received in enumerate(distribution, start=1):
        file.write(f"{son_number} {sacks_received}\n")
        start_index += sacks_received
```

This solution should now produce the correct output by ensuring that each son receives at least one sack and maximizing the inheritance for the youngest son. The corrected implementation avoids the issues seen in the previous attempts.

The output is still incorrect because the code is not correctly allocating sacks to the sons according to the problem constraints. The youngest son is receiving all the remaining sacks after each son is allocated one, but this does not guarantee that the younger sons do not receive more than the older sons.

To address this problem, we need a better approach that ensures the youngest son receives the maximum sum possible, under the condition that no younger son receives more than an older one. We can achieve this by distributing the sacks in a manner that the youngest son receives the sum that is as large as possible, starting with the largest sacks, while ensuring that each older son receives at least as many sacks as the next younger son. We can use a greedy approach, iterating from the largest sacks and distributing them from the youngest son to the oldest, ensuring the constraints are satisfied.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input from file
with open('mostenire.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    sacks = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Sort the sacks to have the largest sacks at the end
sacks.sort()

# Initialize variables for distributing sacks to sons
# Start by giving one sack to each son
sons = [1] * K
remaining_sacks = N - K # Remaining sacks after giving one to each son
index = K - 1 # Start with the youngest son

# Distribute the remaining sacks, starting from the largest ones
while remaining_sacks > 0:
    sons[index] += 1
    remaining_sacks -= 1
    # Move to the next older son if the current son has as many sacks as the next older son
    if index > 0 and sons[index] >= sons[index - 1]:
        index -= 1
    else:
        # Reset index back to the youngest son
        index = K - 1

# Calculate the sum for the youngest son
youngest_sum = sum(sacks[-sons[-1]:])

# Write output to file
with open('mostenire.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{youngest_sum}\n")
    sack_index = 0
    for son_number, sacks_received in enumerate(sons, start=1):
        file.write(f"{son_number} {sacks_received}\n")
        sack_index += sacks_received
```

In this solution, we start by assigning one sack to each son to satisfy the condition that each son must receive at least one sack. Then, we distribute the remaining sacks starting from the end of the sorted sacks list, which contains the sacks with the largest number of coins. We give the sacks to the youngest son first, moving to older sons as needed, ensuring that the distribution respects the constraints.

The `sons` array keeps track of the number of sacks given to each son, and we loop through the remaining sacks, adjusting the index to maintain the order from youngest to oldest. After the distribution, we calculate the sum of gold coins for the youngest son and write the results to the output file.

This solution should now output the correct distribution that maximizes the youngest son's inheritance while respecting the problem's constraints.
