Fetiţele din grupa mare de la grădiniţă culeg flori şi vor să împletească coroniţe pentru festivitatea de premiere. În grădină sunt mai multe tipuri de flori. Fiecare dintre cele $n$ fetiţe culege un buchet având acelaşi număr de flori, însă nu neapărat de acelaşi tip. Pentru a împleti coroniţele fetiţele se împart în grupe. O fetiţă se poate ataşa unui grup numai dacă are cel puţin o floare de acelaşi tip cu cel puţin o altă fetiţă din grupul respectiv.

# Cerinţă
Fiind dat un număr natural $n$ reprezentând numărul fetiţelor şi numărul natural $k$ reprezentând numărul de flori dintr-un buchet, să se determine grupele care se formează.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `flori.in` conţine pe prima linie, separate printr-un spaţiu, numerele naturale $n$ şi $k$, reprezentând numărul de fetiţe şi respectiv numărul de flori din fiecare buchet. Fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii conţine, pentru fiecare fetiţă, câte $k$ valori separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând tipurile de flori culese.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `flori.out` va conţine pe fiecare linie câte o grupă formată din numerele de ordine ale fetiţelor separate prin câte un spaţiu, în ordine crescătoare, ca în exemplu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $1 \leq n \leq 150$
- $1 \leq k \leq 100$
- Tipul unei flori este un număr întreg din intervalul $[0, 100]$.
- Într-o grupă numerele de ordine ale fetiţelor trebuie date în ordine strict crescătoare.
- În fişierul de ieşire grupele vor fi afişate în ordinea crescătoare a numărului de ordine al primei fetiţe din grupă.

Example:
`flori.in`
```
5 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 9 6
1 1 1 1
2 4 4 3
7 7 7 7
```

`flori.out`
```
1 3 4

# Utility function to find groups of girls who can form a wreath together

    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the flowers and the girls that picked them
    flower_to_girls = {}
    for girl in range(n):
        for flower in flowers[girl]:
            if flower not in flower_to_girls:
                flower_to_girls[flower] = set()
            flower_to_girls[flower].add(girl)

    # Initialize a list to keep track of the groups formed
    groups = []

    # Initialize a set to keep track of girls who are already in a group

            stack = [girl]
            while stack:
                current_girl = stack.pop()
                for flower in flowers[current_girl]:
                    for other_girl in flower_to_girls[flower]:
                        if other_girl not in in_group:
                            group.add(other_girl)
                            in_group.add(other_girl)
                            stack.append(other_girl)
            groups.append(sorted(list(group)))

    return groups

# Read input from flori.in
with open('flori.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    flowers = np.loadtxt(file, dtype=int, ndmin=2)

# Find the groups
groups = find_groups(flowers, n, k)

# Write output to flori.out
with open('flori.out', 'w') as file:
    for group in groups:
        file.write(' '.join(str(girl + 1) for girl in group) + '\n')
```
```

This solution uses NumPy to read the input file efficiently into a matrix, avoiding the use of large amounts of memory by storing only integers. It then processes the data to find groups of girls based on the flowers they have picked. The output is written to a file as specified. The solution pays special attention to memory usage to stay within the 8MB limit.

The provided code snippet is a Python solution that uses depth-first search (DFS) to find connected components in a graph. Each node in the graph represents a girl, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding girls have at least one common flower type. The solution reads input from 'flori.in', processes the data to find connected components, and writes the output to 'flori.out'. The program does not use 'input()' or 'print()' for IO operations, adhering to the specified constraints.

This updated code correctly avoids using `input()` and `print()` for handling I/O, and instead reads from "flori.in" and writes to "flori.out". It uses depth-first search to find the connected components in the graph, representing the groups of girls with at least one common flower type amongst them. The solution is optimized for both memory and speed within the constraints provided.
