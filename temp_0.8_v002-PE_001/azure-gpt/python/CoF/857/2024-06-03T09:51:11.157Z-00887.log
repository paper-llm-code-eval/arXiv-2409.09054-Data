Gigel a primit de ziua lui un joc cu bile. Jocul conține $n$ bile numerotate cu numerele naturale distincte de la $1$ la $n$. Jucându-se, Gigel a amestecat bilele astfel încât acum ele nu mai sunt în ordine. Ca să le pună înapoi în cutia jocului, Gigel ia de pe masă bilele una câte una, și le pune în cutie formând un șir. Însă Gigel se joacă și acum, astfel încât el nu pune bilele la rând, una după alta, ci are o regulă pe care o respectă cu strictețe. Astfel, Gigel încearcă să plaseze fiecare bilă pe care a luat-o de pe masă exact la mijlocul șirului de bile deja format. Dacă acest lucru nu este posibil (șirul are lungime impară), atunci el plasează bila la sfârșitul șirului de bile deja format. După ce toate bilele au fost puse în cutie, Gigel își dă seama că nu a notat ordinea în care a luat bilele de pe masă și, în mod firesc, își pune problema dacă nu cumva poate deduce acest lucru din șirul de bile pe care tocmai l-a format.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se numărul de bile și configurația finală a bilelor în șir să se determine:
1. numărul ultimei bile luate de pe masă;
2. ordinea în care bilele au fost luate de pe masă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ordine.in` conține pe prima linie numărul $n$ de bile. Pe linia a doua a fișierului de intrare se găsesc $n$ numere naturale, cu valori între $1$ și $n$, separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă șirul de bile obținut de Gigel în cutie. Linia a treia conține una dintre valorile $1$ sau $2$ reprezentând cerința $1$, dacă se cere determinarea ultimei bile luate de Gigel de pe masă, respectiv cerința $2$, dacă se cere determinarea ordinii în care Gigel a luat bilele de pe masă.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `ordine.out` va conține pe prima linie o valoarea naturală reprezentând numărul ultimei bile luate de Gigel, dacă cerința a fost $1$, respectiv $n$ numere naturale, cu valori cuprinse între $1$ și $n$, separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă ordinea în care Gigel a luat bilele de pe masă, dacă cerința a fost $2$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 250 \ 000$;
* Pentru cerința $1$ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru cerința $2$ se acordă $70\%$ din punctaj.

This Python code reads input from `ordine.in`, determines the order of the balls as Gigel picked them up, and writes the output to `ordine.out`. The code uses NumPy to hold and manipulate the sequence of balls for memory efficiency and fast array operations, keeping memory usage below the 8MB limit. The `calculate_order` function reconstructs the order by working backwards, inserting balls into their correct positions in the order array. Note that the writing and reading from files are outside of the `calculate_order` function to keep the memory usage optimized.

This updated solution uses numpy for efficient memory management and reads from `ordine.in` while writing to `ordine.out`. The code maintains the memory limit and performs the task as described, either finding the last ball picked (task 1) or the order in which the balls were picked (task 2).

This Python code provides a solution to the challenge by using NumPy for array handling, which is both memory and time-efficient. The function `reconstruct_order` is used to find the order in which balls were picked by reversing the process described in the problem. The program reads from `ordine.in` and writes the result to `ordine.out`, following the constraints and not using `input()` or `print()` functions for I/O operations.

It seems that the code is being run in an environment where the NumPy library is not installed. Since installing external libraries is not an option in this context and we have a memory constraint, I will implement the solution without NumPy, using only built-in Python data structures to ensure compatibility and meet memory limitations.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def reconstruct_order(sequence, n):
    order = [0] * n
    mid_indices = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        mid_indices.append(mid_indices[-1] + (-1 if i % 2 else 1))
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        order[i] = sequence[mid_indices[i]]
    return order

def main():
    with open("ordine.in", "r") as infile:
        n = int(infile.readline())
        sequence = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))
        task = int(infile.readline())
    
    if task == 1:
        last_ball = sequence[(n - 1) // 2]
        result = str(last_ball)
    elif task == 2:
        order = reconstruct_order(sequence, n)
        result = ' '.join(map(str, order))

    with open("ordine.out", "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(result + '\n')

main()
```
This code uses built-in Python lists and should run in any standard Python environment without additional dependencies. The `reconstruct_order` function calculates the order of the balls as Gigel picked them up, and the main function reads the input, calls the appropriate function based on the task, and writes the output to a file.

The differences between the expected and found result indicate a logic error in the `reconstruct_order` function. The function incorrectly uses the `mid_indices` list to track the positions where balls should be inserted in reverse order. Instead, it should carefully insert the balls by alternating between the midpoint and the end, simulating Gigel's process in reverse.

Here's the corrected solution, which ensures the correct reconstruction of the order in which Gigel picked up the balls:

```python
def reconstruct_order(sequence, n):
    order = []
    if n % 2 == 0:
        order.extend(sequence[-2::-2])
        order.extend(sequence[-1::-2])
    else:
        order.extend(sequence[::-2])
        order.extend(sequence[-2::-2])
    return order[::-1]

def main():
    with open("ordine.in", "r") as infile:
        n = int(infile.readline())
        sequence = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))
        task = int(infile.readline())
    
    result = ""
    if task == 1:
        last_ball = sequence[(n - 1) // 2]
        result = str(last_ball)
    elif task == 2:
        order = reconstruct_order(sequence, n)
        result = ' '.join(map(str, order))

    with open("ordine.out", "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(result + '\n')

main()
```

In the `reconstruct_order` function, we use list slicing to reverse the sequence and pick every other ball as Gigel would have placed them. We then combine these two slices and reverse them again to get the original order. The `main` function remains the same, handling file I/O and invoking the `reconstruct_order` function for task 2. This solution should produce the expected output and match Gigel's picking order.

The output from the previous solution is not correct because the algorithm for reversing Gigel's process was implemented incorrectly. The logic for placing the balls in their original order based on Gigel's rule should be carefully implemented to mimic the way he adds balls to the sequence.

In Gigel's process, each new ball is placed in the middle of the sequence if the sequence's length is even, or at the end if it's odd. So, to reverse this, we should start with the last ball and reconstruct the sequence by alternating between placing the next ball in the middle (for even lengths) and placing it at the end (for odd lengths), but in reverse.

Let's implement the correct algorithm to reconstruct the order:

```python
def reconstruct_order(sequence, n):
    order = [0] * n
    mid = (n - 1) // 2
    even = True if n % 2 == 0 else False
    index = mid

    for i in range(n):
        order[index] = sequence[i]
        if even:
            index = mid + (i + 1) // 2
        else:
            index = mid - (i + 1) // 2
        if (i + 1) % 2 == 0:
            even = not even

    return order

def main():
    with open("ordine.in", "r") as infile:
        n = int(infile.readline())
        sequence = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))
        task = int(infile.readline())

    if task == 1:
        last_ball = sequence[-1]
        result = str(last_ball)
    elif task == 2:
        order = reconstruct_order(sequence, n)
        result = ' '.join(map(str, order))

    with open("ordine.out", "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(result + '\n')

main()
```

In this corrected solution, we re-implement `reconstruct_order` using a different approach. We start by determining the middle index and iteratively placing the elements based on the even or odd length of the resultant sequence.

This algorithm should work correctly to reconstruct the order in which Gigel picked up the balls and write the expected output to `ordine.out` when the input is provided in `ordine.in`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result suggests that there is a bug in the code that is meant to determine the last ball picked by Gigel. The expected output indicates that the last ball picked should be `5`, but the found output is `6`. This indicates an error in the logic used to determine the last element according to Gigel's rule.

For task 1, we should be able to find the last ball without reconstructing the entire order. Given the rule that Gigel puts each ball in the middle of the sequence, the last ball will always be the one that was placed last in the middle before the sequence grew to its final size, which is when the sequence had an even number of elements (because if it had an odd number, the ball would be placed at the end).

Let's correct the code to properly find the last ball picked (task 1) and ensure the reconstruction of the order (task 2) is also correct:

```python
def reconstruct_order(sequence, n):
    order = [0] * n
    index = 0
    for i in range(n):
        order[index] = sequence[i]
        # Determine the next index based on Gigel's rule, working backwards.
        if i % 2 == 0:
            index = n - (i // 2) - 1
        else:
            index = i // 2
    return order

def main():
    with open("ordine.in", "r") as infile:
        n = int(infile.readline())
        sequence = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))
        task = int(infile.readline())

    if task == 1:
        # Only reconstruct the order up to the second-to-last ball (n-1) since we know the last ball must be at either end.
        # The sequence must end with the second-to-last ball in the middle, which will be at index n//2 in the reconstructed order.
        second_to_last_order = reconstruct_order(sequence[:-1], n-1)
        last_ball = sequence[-1]
        # Check if the last ball should be placed in the middle or at the end.
        if second_to_last_order[(n-1)//2] != last_ball:
            last_ball = sequence[(n-1)//2]
        result = str(last_ball)
    elif task == 2:
        order = reconstruct_order(sequence, n)
        result = ' '.join(map(str, order))

    with open("ordine.out", "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(result + '\n')

main()
```

The `reconstruct_order` function has been corrected to properly determine the index where each ball should be placed when reconstructing the order in reverse. The `main` function now correctly handles task 1 by reconstructing the order up to the second-to-last ball and then determining the last ball by checking where it should be placed according to Gigel's rule.

This corrected code should now produce the expected results for both tasks when reading from `ordine.in` and writing to `ordine.out`.
