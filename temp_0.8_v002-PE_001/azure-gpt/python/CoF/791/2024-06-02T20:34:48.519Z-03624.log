Se consideră matricea $A$ ale cărei elemente pot avea doar valorile $0$ sau $1$ și în care numerotarea liniilor și numerotarea coloanelor începe de la $1$. Pentru un element oarecare al matricei, definim noțiunea de vecin ca fiind acele elementele din matrice aflate în imediata sa apropiere pe una dintre direcțiile orizontală, verticală sau pe cele două diagonale (vezi figura de mai jos în care s-au marcat cu $x$ vecinii elementului marcat cu $o$). Un vecin bun al elementului $A_{ij}$ este un vecin care are aceeași valoare cu $A_{ij}$.

~[vecini.png]

# Cerință

Dându-se matricea $A$, să se determine numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei precum și numărul de elemente care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `vecini.in` conține pe prima linie trei valori naturale $m \ n \ k$ reprezentând numărul de linii, numărul de coloane și respectiv numărul de valori egale cu $1$ din matricea $A$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii se află două valori $i$ si $j$ cu semnificația $A_{ij}$ este egal cu $1$. Aceste valori sunt date in ordinea parcurgerii matricei pe linii de la linia $1$ la linia $m$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vecini.out` va conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate printr-un singur spațiu: $x$ va reprezenta numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei date, iar $y$ va reprezenta numărul de elemente din matricea dată care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m,n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq k \leq n \cdot m / 2+1$;
* Pentru $30$% dintre teste $2 \leq m,n \leq 200$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        m, n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
        ones_positions = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in f.readlines()]
    return m, n, k, ones_positions

def create_matrix(m, n, ones_positions):
    mat = np.zeros((m+2, n+2), dtype=np.int8)  # Add padding to avoid boundary checking
    for i, j in ones_positions:
        mat[i, j] = 1
    return mat

def find_max_good_neighbors(mat, m, n):
    # Initialize variables to track the maximum number of good neighbors and its frequency
    max_neighbors = 0

                good_neighbors = sum(mat[i+di, j+dj] for di, dj in shifts)
                
                # Update max_neighbors and max_count if necessary
                if good_neighbors > max_neighbors:
                    max_neighbors = good_neighbors
                    max_count = 1
                elif good_neighbors == max_neighbors:
                    max_count += 1

    return max_neighbors, max_count

def write_output(file_name, max_neighbors, max_count):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{max_neighbors} {max_count}\n")

# Read input from the file
m, n, k, ones_positions = read_input('vecini.in')

# Create the matrix and process it
matrix = create_matrix(m, n, ones_positions)
max_neighbors, max_count = find_max_good_neighbors(matrix, m, n)

# Write output to the file
write_output('vecini.out', max_neighbors, max_count)
```

Please note that this code should be placed in a Python file and run outside of an interactive environment since it interacts with the file system directly. Additionally, make sure to have the `vecini.in` file with the appropriate input data in the same directory as the Python script. The script will generate `vecini.out` as output.

The `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the `numpy` library, which the code relies on, is not installed in the environment. Since the problem states that we should use efficient libraries and the memory limit is strict, it seems like using `numpy` was intended. However, if the environment cannot have `numpy` installed, we need to write a solution that does not depend on `numpy` or any other external libraries.

Here is a complete solution that does not use `numpy` or any other external libraries, still optimizing for time and memory usage:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        m, n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
        ones_positions = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in f.readlines()]
    return m, n, k, ones_positions

def find_max_good_neighbors(m, n, k, ones_positions):
    # Initialize a matrix with padding to avoid boundary checking
    mat = [[0] * (n+2) for _ in range(m+2)]
    # Populate the matrix with 1's for given positions
    for i, j in ones_positions:
        mat[i][j] = 1
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum good neighbors
    max_neighbors = 0
    max_count = 0
    
    # Define neighborhood index shifts including diagonals
    shifts = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    # Iterate over elements of the matrix within original boundaries (without padding)
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if mat[i][j] == 1:
                # Calculate the number of good neighbors for the current cell
                good_neighbors = sum(mat[i+di][j+dj] for di, dj in shifts)
                
                # Update maximum good neighbors and their count
                if good_neighbors > max_neighbors:
                    max_neighbors = good_neighbors
                    max_count = 1
                elif good_neighbors == max_neighbors:
                    max_count += 1

    return max_neighbors, max_count

def write_output(file_name, max_neighbors, max_count):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{max_neighbors} {max_count}\n")

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read input from the file
    m, n, k, ones_positions = read_input('vecini.in')
    
    # Find maximum number of good neighbors and how many elements have them
    max_neighbors, max_count = find_max_good_neighbors(m, n, k, ones_positions)
    
    # Write the result to the output file
    write_output('vecini.out', max_neighbors, max_count)
```

This solution creates a matrix with padding and iterates over it using the provided positions of the ones to count the maximum number of good neighbors. It writes the output to a file without using external libraries, respecting the memory limit.

The issue with the current output is that it seems to be counting only the '1' elements when considering good neighbors, but the definition of a good neighbor is an adjacent element that shares the same value, which can be either '0' or '1'. This means the program needs to consider not only the '1' elements but also the surrounding '0' elements and their neighbors.

To correct this, we must check all elements in the matrix for their good neighbors, not only the ones set to '1'. Additionally, we need to correctly populate the padded matrix to allow for correct neighbor counting around the boundary elements.

Let's rewrite the function `find_max_good_neighbors` to fix the issue:

```python
def find_max_good_neighbors(m, n, k, ones_positions):
    # Initialize a matrix with padding to avoid boundary checking
    mat = [[0] * (n+2) for _ in range(m+2)]
    # Populate the matrix with 1's for given positions
    for i, j in ones_positions:
        mat[i][j] = 1
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum good neighbors
    max_neighbors = 0
    max_count = 0
    
    # Define neighborhood index shifts including diagonals
    shifts = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    # Iterate over elements of the matrix within original boundaries (without padding)
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            current_value = mat[i][j]
            # Calculate the number of good neighbors for the current cell
            good_neighbors = sum(mat[i+di][j+dj] == current_value for di, dj in shifts)
            
            # Update maximum good neighbors and their count
            if good_neighbors > max_neighbors:
                max_neighbors = good_neighbors
                max_count = 1
            elif good_neighbors == max_neighbors:
                max_count += 1

    return max_neighbors, max_count

# The rest of the code remains unchanged, just call this updated function in the main execution block
```

With this fix, the code now checks every element for good neighbors, whether it's '0' or '1', and compares them to the current element's value, thereby correctly computing the maximum number of good neighbors and how many elements have that number. The other functions `read_input`, `write_output`, and the main execution block remain the same as in the previous solution.

Apologies for the oversight. Based on the problem statement, the function `find_max_good_neighbors` needs to check all cells in the matrix and count the number of good neighbors for each cell, whether it's a '0' or a '1'. The previous solution failed to do this since it only considered cells with '1's.

Let's rewrite the function `find_max_good_neighbors` to correctly handle both '0' and '1' cells, and ensure the output is written to `vecini.out` without using `print()`:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        m, n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
        ones = {(int(line.split()[0]), int(line.split()[1])) for line in f}
    return m, n, k, ones

def find_max_good_neighbors(m, n, ones):
    # Initialize counters for good neighbors
    neighbors = {}
    max_neighbors = 0
    count = 0

    # Iterate through all 1s to update neighbor counts
    for (i, j) in ones:
        for di in range(-1, 2):
            for dj in range(-1, 2):
                if (di, dj) != (0, 0) and (i + di, j + dj) in ones:
                    neighbors[(i, j)] = neighbors.get((i, j), 0) + 1

    # Find the maximum neighbors and count how many times it occurs
    for (i, j), neighbor_count in neighbors.items():
        if neighbor_count > max_neighbors:
            max_neighbors = neighbor_count
            count = 1
        elif neighbor_count == max_neighbors:
            count += 1

    return max_neighbors, count

def write_output(file_name, max_neighbors, count):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{max_neighbors} {count}\n")

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    m, n, k, ones = read_input('vecini.in')
    max_neighbors, count = find_max_good_neighbors(m, n, ones)
    write_output('vecini.out', max_neighbors, count)
```

This solution calculates the number of good neighbors for '1' cells and finds the maximum number of good neighbors. It then writes the results to `vecini.out` as required. Please note that when using this script, ensure that the `vecini.in` file is placed in the same directory as the script.

Upon reevaluation, the last provided solution still has a mistake because it only counts neighbors for the cells with '1's and does not consider the cells with '0's as potential candidates for having good neighbors. According to the problem statement, we must consider all cells in the matrix and calculate the number of good neighbors (same value neighbors) for each.

Let's implement the solution correctly by iterating over all cells and counting the number of good neighbors; both '0's and '1's need to have their neighbors counted:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        m, n, k = map(int, f.readline().split())
        ones = {(int(line.split()[0]), int(line.split()[1])) for line in f}
    return m, n, k, ones

def find_max_good_neighbors(m, n, ones):
    # Initialize matrix with extra padding to avoid boundary checks
    mat = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]
    for (i, j) in ones:
        mat[i][j] = 1

    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum number of good neighbors
    max_neighbors = 0
    max_count = 0

    # Define neighborhood shifts including diagonals
    shifts = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    # Iterate over elements of the matrix within original boundaries (without padding)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            # Count the number of good neighbors
            good_neighbors = 0
            for di, dj in shifts:
                if mat[i][j] == mat[i + di][j + dj]:
                    good_neighbors += 1

            # Update max_neighbors and max_count
            if good_neighbors > max_neighbors:
                max_neighbors = good_neighbors
                max_count = 1
            elif good_neighbors == max_neighbors:
                max_count += 1

    # Return the maximum number of good neighbors and the count of such cells
    return max_neighbors, max_count

def write_output(file_name, max_neighbors, count):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{max_neighbors} {count}\n")

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    m, n, k, ones = read_input('vecini.in')
    max_neighbors, count = find_max_good_neighbors(m, n, ones)
    write_output('vecini.out', max_neighbors, count)
```

This corrected solution reads from `vecini.in`, calculates the right number of good neighbors considering all cells, and writes the expected output to `vecini.out`. It should now provide the correct output for any valid input consistent with the problem statement.
