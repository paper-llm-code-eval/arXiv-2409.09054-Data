Se consideră matricea $A$ ale cărei elemente pot avea doar valorile $0$ sau $1$ și în care numerotarea liniilor și numerotarea coloanelor începe de la $1$. Pentru un element oarecare al matricei, definim noțiunea de vecin ca fiind acele elementele din matrice aflate în imediata sa apropiere pe una dintre direcțiile orizontală, verticală sau pe cele două diagonale (vezi figura de mai jos în care s-au marcat cu $x$ vecinii elementului marcat cu $o$). Un vecin bun al elementului $A_{ij}$ este un vecin care are aceeași valoare cu $A_{ij}$.

~[vecini.png]

# Cerință

Dându-se matricea $A$, să se determine numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei precum și numărul de elemente care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `vecini.in` conține pe prima linie trei valori naturale $m \ n \ k$ reprezentând numărul de linii, numărul de coloane și respectiv numărul de valori egale cu $1$ din matricea $A$. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii se află două valori $i$ si $j$ cu semnificația $A_{ij}$ este egal cu $1$. Aceste valori sunt date in ordinea parcurgerii matricei pe linii de la linia $1$ la linia $m$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vecini.out` va conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate printr-un singur spațiu: $x$ va reprezenta numărul maxim de vecini buni pe care îi are unul dintre elementele matricei date, iar $y$ va reprezenta numărul de elemente din matricea dată care au acest număr maxim de vecini buni.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m,n \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq k \leq n \cdot m / 2+1$;
* Pentru $30$% dintre teste $2 \leq m,n \leq 200$;

```python
import numpy as np

# Read input data from 'vecini.in'

    m, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = np.zeros((m + 2, n + 2), dtype=int)  # Add padding to simplify neighbor checks
    ones_positions = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Update matrix with ones
for i, j in ones_positions:
    matrix[i, j] = 1

# Initialize variables to count maximum number of good neighbors and its frequency
max_good_neighbors = 0
max_good_neighbors_count = 0

# Define 8 possible neighbor positions relative to the current element
neighbor_positions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),
                      ( 0, -1),          ( 0, 1),
                      ( 1, -1), ( 1, 0), ( 1, 1)]

# Function to count good neighbors
def count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j):
    return sum(matrix[i + dx, j + dy] == matrix[i, j] for dx, dy in neighbor_positions)

# Iterate through all elements with value 1 to find number of good neighbors
for i, j in ones_positions:
    good_neighbors = count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j)
    if good_neighbors > max_good_neighbors:
        max_good_neighbors = good_neighbors
        max_good_neighbors_count = 1
    elif good_neighbors == max_good_neighbors:

# Write output data to 'vecini.out'
with open('vecini.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_good_neighbors} {max_good_neighbors_count}\n")
```
```

This script reads from 'vecini.in', processes the information to find the maximum number of good neighbors and how many elements have that number, then writes the result to 'vecini.out'. The memory consumption is minimized by using numpy arrays, and the time complexity is optimized by only counting good neighbors for elements with value 1.

I apologize for any confusion. Here's the corrected solution that reads from `vecini.in` and writes to `vecini.out` without using `input()` or `print()`. This solution is optimized for memory usage by using NumPy and adheres to the specified memory limit.

```python
import numpy as np

# Read input data from 'vecini.in'
with open('vecini.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = np.zeros((m + 2, n + 2), dtype=int)  # Add padding to avoid boundary checking
    for _ in range(k):
        i, j = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix[i, j] = 1

# Calculate the number of good neighbors for each cell
good_neighbors = np.zeros_like(matrix)
for di in range(-1, 2):
    for dj in range(-1, 2):
        if di == 0 and dj == 0:
            continue
        good_neighbors[1:m+1, 1:n+1] += matrix[1+di:m+1+di, 1+dj:n+1+dj] == matrix[1:m+1, 1:n+1]

# Find the maximum number of good neighbors and the number of cells with this number
max_good_neighbors = np.max(good_neighbors[1:m+1, 1:n+1])
max_good_neighbors_count = np.sum(good_neighbors[1:m+1, 1:n+1] == max_good_neighbors)

# Write output data to 'vecini.out'

The exit code indicates that the environment where the code is running does not have the NumPy library installed, which is required by the script. The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` error clearly states that the issue is with the NumPy import.

To fix this without using NumPy, we can use a list of lists to represent the matrix and manually check the neighboring cells for each element. Here's the updated solution without using NumPy:

```python
# Initialize matrix with zeros
def initialize_matrix(m, n):
    return [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]

# Function to count good neighbors
def count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j, m, n):
    neighbors = 0
    for dx in range(-1, 2):
        for dy in range(-1, 2):
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                continue
            if 1 <= i + dx <= m and 1 <= j + dy <= n:
                neighbors += matrix[i + dx][j + dy] == matrix[i][j]
    return neighbors

# Read input data from 'vecini.in'
with open('vecini.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = initialize_matrix(m, n)
    for _ in range(k):
        i, j = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix[i][j] = 1

# Initialize variables to count maximum number of good neighbors and its frequency
max_good_neighbors = 0
max_good_neighbors_count = 0

# Iterate through all elements with value 1 to find number of good neighbors
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if matrix[i][j] == 1:
            good_neighbors = count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j, m, n)
            if good_neighbors > max_good_neighbors:
                max_good_neighbors = good_neighbors
                max_good_neighbors_count = 1
            elif good_neighbors == max_good_neighbors:
                max_good_neighbors_count += 1

# Write output data to 'vecini.out'
with open('vecini.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_good_neighbors} {max_good_neighbors_count}\n")
```

This code should work in an environment that does not have NumPy installed, as it only uses built-in Python data structures and functions.

The result differs from the expected output because the previous code only counts good neighbors for cells that have a value of 1. However, cells with a value of 0 can also have good neighbors (other 0s around them). This was not accounted for in the previous implementation. 

In the given input, cells with a value of 0 at the edge of the matrix or near a 1 can have up to 3 good neighbors (other 0s), and this also needs to be considered to correctly count the maximum number of good neighbors.

Let's correct the implementation to consider both 1 and 0 values:

```python
# Function to count good neighbors
def count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j):
    neighbors = 0
    for dx in range(-1, 2):
        for dy in range(-1, 2):
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                continue
            if matrix[i + dx][j + dy] == matrix[i][j]:
                neighbors += 1
    return neighbors

# Read input data from 'vecini.in' and initialize matrix
with open('vecini.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]
    for _ in range(k):
        i, j = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix[i][j] = 1

# Initialize variables to count maximum number of good neighbors and its frequency
max_good_neighbors = 0
max_good_neighbors_count = 0

# Iterate through all elements to find the number of good neighbors
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        good_neighbors = count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j)
        if good_neighbors > max_good_neighbors:
            max_good_neighbors = good_neighbors
            max_good_neighbors_count = 1
        elif good_neighbors == max_good_neighbors:
            max_good_neighbors_count += 1

# Write output data to 'vecini.out'
with open('vecini.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_good_neighbors} {max_good_neighbors_count}\n")
```

This code correctly calculates the number of good neighbors for all cells, regardless of their value, and updates the maximum number of good neighbors and its count accordingly. It should now produce the correct output for any given input.

The found output is incorrect because it did not properly account for the fact that for a cell to have good neighbors, it must be surrounded by neighboring cells with the same value. The previous implementation incorrectly considered the padded 0s around the matrix as potential good neighbors, which is not accurate according to the problem definition.

Let's revise the implementation to consider only the valid neighbors by checking within the bounds of the actual matrix (excluding the padding), and correctly calculate the number of good neighbors for cells with value 1 as well as for cells with value 0. We will also add a condition to ensure that we are only considering cells within the original matrix dimensions when counting good neighbors.

Here is the revised code:

```python
# Read input data from 'vecini.in' and initialize matrix
with open('vecini.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [[0 for _ in range(n + 2)] for _ in range(m + 2)]  # Padding with zeros
    for _ in range(k):
        i, j = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix[i][j] = 1

# Function to count good neighbors
def count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j):
    neighbors = 0
    for dx in (-1, 0, 1):
        for dy in (-1, 0, 1):
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                continue  # Skip the cell itself
            # Check if neighbor is within bounds and has the same value
            if matrix[i + dx][j + dy] == matrix[i][j]:
                neighbors += 1
    return neighbors

# Initialize variables to find max number of good neighbors
max_good_neighbors = 0
max_good_neighbors_count = 0

# Iterate over the actual matrix dimensions
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        good_neighbors = count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j)
        if good_neighbors > max_good_neighbors:
            max_good_neighbors = good_neighbors
            max_good_neighbors_count = 1
        elif good_neighbors == max_good_neighbors:
            max_good_neighbors_count += 1

# Write output data to 'vecini.out'
with open('vecini.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_good_neighbors} {max_good_neighbors_count}\n")
```

This code should now accurately consider only the valid neighbors for each cell and produce the correct output based on the problem statement.

There appears to be a misunderstanding in how the good neighbors are counted. The previous solution still incorrectly assumes that all surrounding cells contribute to the good neighbor count, but the problem statement defines a good neighbor based on whether it has the same value as the current cell and is in the immediate vicinity.

The mistake in the previous solution is that it is considering all the cells with 1 to have 7 good neighbors from the padding, which is incorrect. Instead, we should not consider the padding at all when counting good neighbors. We must count the good neighbors for each cell in the original matrix, not including the padding.

Let's correct the implementation to count good neighbors only within the original matrix dimensions and for both cells with value 1 and value 0.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
# Function to count good neighbors
def count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j, m, n):
    neighbor_offsets = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),
                        (0, -1),           (0, 1),
                        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    count = 0
    for dx, dy in neighbor_offsets:
        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
        if 1 <= ni <= m and 1 <= nj <= n and matrix[ni][nj] == matrix[i][j]:
            count += 1
    return count

# Read input data from 'vecini.in' and initialize matrix
with open('vecini.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    matrix = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]
    for _ in range(k):
        i, j = map(int, file.readline().split())
        matrix[i][j] = 1

# Initialize variables to find max number of good neighbors
max_good_neighbors = 0
max_good_neighbors_count = 0

# Iterate over the actual matrix dimensions
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        good_neighbors = count_good_neighbors(matrix, i, j, m, n)
        if good_neighbors > max_good_neighbors:
            max_good_neighbors = good_neighbors
            max_good_neighbors_count = 1
        elif good_neighbors == max_good_neighbors:
            max_good_neighbors_count += 1

# Write output data to 'vecini.out'
with open('vecini.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_good_neighbors} {max_good_neighbors_count}\n")
```

This code properly counts the good neighbors for each cell within the original matrix and updates the maximum number of good neighbors and the count of cells with that maximum number. It should provide the correct output for the given input.
