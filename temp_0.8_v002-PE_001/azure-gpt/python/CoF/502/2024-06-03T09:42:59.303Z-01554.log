Se dă un graf **orientat** cu $n$ noduri și $m$ muchii. Fiecare muchie are costul $1$ (poate fi parcursă într-un minut). Doi „prieteni” (veri) pornesc din nodul $S$. Unul dintre ei vrea să ajungă în nodul $A$, iar celălalt vrea să ajungă în nodul $B$.
\
Cei doi prieteni se vor plimba împreună până când ciclează, adică până când vor ajunge în același nod a doua oară, notat cu $Z$. După ciclare, ei își pot continua drumurile separat. Totuși, dacă vor, pot să meargă amândoi în continuare pe același drum: doar dispare obligația de a merge împreună.

Fiecare dintre ei trebuie să-și termine drumul doar după ciclare, adică după ce nu mai sunt obligați să meargă împreună. Totuși, este în regulă dacă drumul unuia se termină exact în nodul în care au ciclat (adică ciclează în $A$ sau $B$).
\
Care este numărul minim de minute necesar astfel încât să fie posibil ca amândoi să ajungă la destinațiile lor, în timpul alocat, în $A$, respectiv $B$?

Cu alte cuvinte, dacă cei doi veri ciclează pentru prima oară după exact $t$ minute, apoi își continuă drumurile pentru alte $t_A$, respectiv $t_B$ minute, vrem să aflăm valoarea minimă a lui $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$.
\
Există două tipuri de cerințe, reprezentate printr-un număr $c$:
- Dacă $c = 1$, trebuie calculată valoarea minimă a lui $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$.
- Dacă $c = 2$, trebuie afișat un triplet de drumuri care poate fi urmat de cei doi veri (drumul comun din $S$ până în $Z$, drum urmat ulterior de primul văr din $Z$ până în $A$, drum urmat ulterior de al doilea văr din $Z$ până în $B$), astfel încât valoarea asociată drumurilor, adică $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$ să fie minimă. Orice triplet corect cu valoarea asociată minimă poate fi afișat.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsește $c$. Pe a doua linie se găsesc doi întregi $n$ și $m$. Pe a treia linie se găsesc trei întregi $S$, $A$ și $B$.

Pe următoarele $m$ linii se găsesc câte doi întregi $X$ și $Y$, reprezentând că există o muchie direcționată de la nodul $X$ la nodul $Y$, care poate fi parcursă într-un minut (de cost $1$).

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $c = 1$, afișați un singur număr, valoarea minimă a lui $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$.

Dacă $c = 2$, afișati trei drumuri. Primul drum este format de la $S$ până la $Z$. Al doilea drum este format de la $Z$ până la $A$. Al treilea drum este format de la $Z$ până la $B$, unde $S$, $A$, $B$, $Z$ sunt definite anterior.

Fiecare drum se va tipări pe două linii separate:
- Pe prima linie va apărea lungimea drumului, adică numărul de muchii.
- Pe a doua linie vor apărea nodurile drumului, separate prin câte un spațiu.

Valorea asociată drumurilor, adică $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$, trebuie să fie minimă.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq S, A, B, Z \leq n \leq 5\ 000$
- Nodurile sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$.
- $A \neq B$
- $1 \leq m \leq n \times (n-1)$.
- Se garantează că pentru orice test dat spre rezolvare există cel puțin o soluție.
- Nu există muchii de la un nod la el însuși. Există maxim o muchie orientată între oricare două noduri distincte.
- Dacă verii se despart în $A$, primul văr poate să nu mai facă nimic (drumul lui ulterior ar avea $0$ muchii și l-ar conține doar pe $A$; vezi exemplul 3). Analog pentru $B$.
- Pentru fiecare subtask, testele cu $c = 1$ vor conta pentru $60\%$ din punctaj.
- Pentru 30 de puncte, $n \leq 500$, $m = n$ și toate muchiile sunt de forma $i \rightarrow (i\ mod\ n) + 1$, unde $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$.
- Pentru 50 de puncte, $n \leq 500$.
- Pentru 20 de puncte, $n \leq 5\ 000$ și $m \leq 4 \times n$.

This code reads the input from the `veri.in` file, processes the information, finds the shortest paths, and writes the output to the `veri.out` file. The code avoids using `input()` or `print()` statements for I/O as per the problem statement and uses numpy to optimize memory usage and for more efficient computations. The solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest paths from A and B to all other nodes and then constructs the required paths.

The provided program exited with code 1 due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the `numpy` module is not available. Since the challenge requires us to optimize both time and memory usage and adhere to a memory limit, we must use standard Python libraries that do not exceed the memory constraints and are available in the environment.

To fix the program, we will remove the usage of the `numpy` library and instead use standard Python data structures to perform the necessary computations. Here is the revised solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def read_graph(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c = int(file.readline().strip())
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        S, A, B = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        edges = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    
    return c, n, m, S, A, B, edges

def write_output(filename, c, paths):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:

        elif c == 2:
            for length, path in paths:
                file.write(f"{length}\n{' '.join(map(str, path))}\n")

def bfs(graph, start):
    q = deque([start])
    distances = [-1] * len(graph)
    distances[start] = 0
    while q:
        v = q.popleft()
        for u in graph[v]:
            if distances[u] == -1:
                distances[u] = distances[v] + 1
                q.append(u)
    return distances

def find_cycle(graph, S, A, B):
    dist_A = bfs(graph, A)
    dist_B = bfs(graph, B)
    
    min_time = float('inf')
    cycle_node = None
    for node in range(1, len(graph)):
        if dist_A[node] != -1 and dist_B[node] != -1:
            time = max(dist_A[node], dist_B[node])
            if time < min_time:
                min_time = time
                cycle_node = node
    return min_time, cycle_node

def reconstruct_path(pred, start, end):
    path = []
    current = end
    while current != start:
        path.append(current)
        current = pred[current]
    path.append(start)
    path.reverse()
    return path

def main():
    c, n, m, S, A, B, edges = read_graph('veri.in')
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for x, y in edges:
        graph[x].append(y)
    
    min_time, cycle_node = find_cycle(graph, S, A, B)
    
    # We only need the paths if c == 2
    if c == 2:
        pred_A = bfs(graph, cycle_node)
        pred_B = bfs(graph, cycle_node)
        
        path_S_Z = reconstruct_path(pred_A, S, cycle_node)
        path_Z_A = reconstruct_path(pred_A, cycle_node, A)
        path_Z_B = reconstruct_path(pred_B, cycle_node, B)
        
        write_output('veri.out', c, [(len(path_S_Z)-1, path_S_Z), (len(path_Z_A)-1, path_Z_A), (len(path_Z_B)-1, path_Z_B)])
    else:
        write_output('veri.out', c, min_time)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this revised solution, we have removed the dependency on the `numpy` library and instead used lists and queues (from the `collections.deque` class) to build the graph and perform breadth-first searches. The `read_graph` function reads the input file, the `write_output` function writes to the output file, the `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search to compute distances from a given start node, the `find_cycle` function finds the cycle node Z and the minimum time for the cousins to cycle, and the `reconstruct_path` function reconstructs the path from the predecessor list. The `main` function coordinates the reading of the input, finding the cycle node and the minimum time, optionally reconstructing the paths, and writing the output.

The error is a `TypeError` indicating that `NoneType` was used as a list index, which is illegal. This occurred because the `cycle_node` variable was set to `None` when no cycle node was found. This scenario should not happen as per the problem statement, which guarantees at least one solution; however, we should still handle this case correctly in our code.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that `cycle_node` is always an integer before we use it as an index. We can add a condition before reconstructing the paths to ensure that `cycle_node` is not `None`. If it happens to be `None`, we need to handle this case appropriately, perhaps by outputting an error message or taking other corrective measures as dictated by the problem context.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

        write_output('veri.out', c, paths)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected solution:
- I added a condition to check if `cycle_node` is `None` after finding the minimum time. If it is, an exception is raised, as this should never happen according to the problem statement.
- I also fixed the reconstruction of paths to ensure that we are adding the correct predecessors that lead to the correct distances as given by BFS.
- The output writing has been adjusted to accommodate the change in how results are passed to the `write_output` function.

This updated code should now handle the case where `cycle_node` is `None`, although this case should never occur based on the problem's constraints.

The error that caused the exit code 1 is due to an Exception being raised in the program. The exception was added as a safeguard to check the `cycle_node` variable for `None`. However, given that the problem statement guarantees at least one solution, the existence of the exception means that there is a logical error in the way we are trying to identify the cycle node.

On reevaluation, it seems that the logic for finding the cycle node is indeed flawed. The cycle node Z is incorrectly being determined based on the distances from the start node S, and A and B. However, what we should be looking for is the first node that the two friends will cycle at. This will be the node where both distA and distB are the same and the smallest.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

In this corrected version of the program:
- I have adjusted the condition for finding the cycle node to correctly reflect the first node at which both friends cycle.
- The BFS function now also returns the parent array, which is used to reconstruct the path from the cycle node to the start node S and from A and B to the cycle node.
- If the cycle node is `None`, which should never happen according to the problem statement, the program writes "No solution" to the output file.
- The logic for reconstructing paths has been updated to follow the parent pointers from the cycle node to the source node or destination nodes A and B.

This program should now correctly handle the problem and find a solution consistent with the problem's guarantees.

The error is due to a mismatch in the expected format of the result when writing to the output file. The `write_output` function is expecting a list of tuples where each tuple has two elements, but it received a single string "No solution" when `cycle_node` was found to be `None`. This case should not happen according to the problem constraints, but we can add a check to ensure the code doesn't fail if the graph input is incorrect.

Before rewriting the entire solution, I will correct the handling for the "No solution" case to avoid confusion. Since the problem guarantees at least one solution, we will assume the graph input is correct and remove the check that caused the exception. We will assume that the `cycle_node` will always be valid, and we should always find a cycle node according to the problem's constraints.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
from collections import deque

def read_graph(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c = int(file.readline().strip())
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

    while q:
        v = q.popleft()
        for u in graph[v]:
            if distances[u] == -1:
                distances[u] = distances[v] + 1
                parents[u] = v
                q.append(u)
    return distances, parents

def main():
    c, n, m, S, A, B, edges = read_graph('veri.in')

    distS, _ = bfs(graph, S)
    distA, parentA = bfs(graph, A)
    distB, parentB = bfs(graph, B)

    cycle_node = None
    min_dist = float('inf')

    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if distS[node] >= 0 and distA[node] >= 0 and distB[node] >= 0:
            if distA[node] == distB[node] and distA[node] < min_dist:
                min_dist = distA[node]
                cycle_node = node

    min_time = distS[cycle_node] + min_dist

    if c == 1:
        write_output('veri.out', c, min_time)
    else:
        # Reconstructing the paths from A and B to the cycle node Z
        path_Z_A = []
        node = cycle_node
        while node is not None:
            path_Z_A.append(node)
            node = parentA[node]
        path_Z_A.reverse()
        
        path_Z_B = []
        node = cycle_node
        while node is not None:

            node = parentA[node] if parentA[node] is not None else parentB[node]
        path_S_Z.append(S)
        path_S_Z.reverse()

        # Writing the output with the paths
        paths = [(len(path_S_Z)-1, path_S_Z), (len(path_Z_A)-1, path_Z_A), (len(path_Z_B)-1, path_Z_B)]
        write_output('veri.out', c, min_time, paths)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version:
- The `write_output` function has been updated to take an additional `paths` argument, which is only used if `c == 2`. The `min_time` is always written to the file, and if `c == 2`, then the paths are written as well.
- The logic for finding the `cycle_node` now correctly identifies a node that is reachable from S, A, and B and where the distances from A and B are equal and minimal.
- The code no longer checks for the `cycle_node` being `None` because the problem statement guarantees a solution.
- The `main` function has been updated to handle the correct output for both cases (`c == 1` and `c == 2`) as per the problem requirements.

This program should now solve the problem as described without encountering the errors seen previously.

The error is caused due to `cycle_node` being `None` at the point where it's used as an index to access an element in the `distS` list. This suggests that the logic to find the `cycle_node` may still be incorrect or the input data does not adhere to the stated problem guarantees.

Let's fix the logic for finding the cycle node based on a correct understanding of the problem statement. According to the problem, the cycle node is the first node where the paths from S to A and S to B can diverge. This node will be the last common node on the shortest paths from S to A and S to B.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

        for u in graph[v]:
            if distances[u] == -1:
                distances[u] = distances[v] + 1
                parents[u] = v
                q.append(u)
    return distances, parents

    # Find distances and parents from S to all other nodes
    distS, parentS = bfs(graph, S)
    # Find distances from A and B to all other nodes (not using parents here)
    distA, _ = bfs(graph, A)
    distB, _ = bfs(graph, B)

    # The cycle node is the first common ancestor in the BFS tree of A and B
    cycle_node = None
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if distA[node] == distB[node] and distS[node] != -1:
            cycle_node = node
            break

    if cycle_node is None:
        raise Exception("No cycle node found, which should not happen according to the problem statement.")

    min_time = distS[cycle_node] + max(distA[cycle_node], distB[cycle_node])

    if c == 1:
        write_output('veri.out', c, min_time)
    else:
        # Reconstructing the paths from A and B to the cycle node Z
        path_Z_A = []
        node = cycle_node
        while node is not None:
            path_Z_A.append(node)

        path_Z_A.reverse()
        
        path_Z_B = []

        path_S_Z = path_Z_A[:] # Take a copy since we are going to reverse it

        # Writing the output with the paths
        paths = [(len(path_S_Z)-1, path_S_Z), (len(path_Z_A)-1, path_Z_A[1:]), (len(path_Z_B)-1, path_Z_B[1:])]
        write_output('veri.out', c, min_time, paths)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version:
- The BFS function is used to find distances and parents from the start node S to all other nodes. It also finds distances from nodes A and B to all other nodes.
- The cycle node Z is determined as the first common node on the paths from S to A and S to B where the distances from A and B are the same, and there is a path from S.
- The exception for "No cycle node found" is retained because, as per the problem statement, there must be at least one solution, and if we do not find such a node, it indicates a problem with the logic or input data.
- Once Z is found, we can reconstruct the paths from A and B to Z using the parents obtained from the BFS tree rooted at S. Since the path S to Z is common, we don't need to reconstruct it separately; we can use the path from Z to S (which is the same as Z to A since it's the first common node).

This program should now work correctly for all valid inputs according to the problem statement.

The results differ because the logic to find the cycle node is incorrect. The cycle node should be the last shared node on the paths from S to A and S to B or a node where the two cousins meet, not necessarily the first node where the distances from A and B are the same (which may not even exist). Additionally, the output for case 2 is incorrect because we are not correctly reconstructing the paths from the cycle node to A and B, and we are not correctly considering the shared path that the friends take before they cycle.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct approach:

1. Run BFS from S to find the shortest paths to all nodes.
2. Find the shortest distances from A to all other nodes and B to all other nodes using BFS.
3. Determine the last shared node (cycle node) on the paths from S to A and S to B.
4. Calculate the minimum time to reach A and B after cycling, considering the shared path.
5. Reconstruct the shared path and the individual paths from the cycle node to A and B.

Corrected solution:

This corrected solution should now produce the correct output for both cases (`c == 1` and `c == 2`), and the logic for finding the cycle node and reconstructing the paths should adhere to the problem's constraints.
