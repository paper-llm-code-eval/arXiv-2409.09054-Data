Se dă un graf **orientat** cu $n$ noduri și $m$ muchii. Fiecare muchie are costul $1$ (poate fi parcursă într-un minut). Doi „prieteni” (veri) pornesc din nodul $S$. Unul dintre ei vrea să ajungă în nodul $A$, iar celălalt vrea să ajungă în nodul $B$.
\
Cei doi prieteni se vor plimba împreună până când ciclează, adică până când vor ajunge în același nod a doua oară, notat cu $Z$. După ciclare, ei își pot continua drumurile separat. Totuși, dacă vor, pot să meargă amândoi în continuare pe același drum: doar dispare obligația de a merge împreună.

Fiecare dintre ei trebuie să-și termine drumul doar după ciclare, adică după ce nu mai sunt obligați să meargă împreună. Totuși, este în regulă dacă drumul unuia se termină exact în nodul în care au ciclat (adică ciclează în $A$ sau $B$).
\
Care este numărul minim de minute necesar astfel încât să fie posibil ca amândoi să ajungă la destinațiile lor, în timpul alocat, în $A$, respectiv $B$?

Cu alte cuvinte, dacă cei doi veri ciclează pentru prima oară după exact $t$ minute, apoi își continuă drumurile pentru alte $t_A$, respectiv $t_B$ minute, vrem să aflăm valoarea minimă a lui $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$.
\
Există două tipuri de cerințe, reprezentate printr-un număr $c$:
- Dacă $c = 1$, trebuie calculată valoarea minimă a lui $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$.
- Dacă $c = 2$, trebuie afișat un triplet de drumuri care poate fi urmat de cei doi veri (drumul comun din $S$ până în $Z$, drum urmat ulterior de primul văr din $Z$ până în $A$, drum urmat ulterior de al doilea văr din $Z$ până în $B$), astfel încât valoarea asociată drumurilor, adică $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$ să fie minimă. Orice triplet corect cu valoarea asociată minimă poate fi afișat.

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie se găsește $c$. Pe a doua linie se găsesc doi întregi $n$ și $m$. Pe a treia linie se găsesc trei întregi $S$, $A$ și $B$.

Pe următoarele $m$ linii se găsesc câte doi întregi $X$ și $Y$, reprezentând că există o muchie direcționată de la nodul $X$ la nodul $Y$, care poate fi parcursă într-un minut (de cost $1$).

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $c = 1$, afișați un singur număr, valoarea minimă a lui $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$.

Dacă $c = 2$, afișati trei drumuri. Primul drum este format de la $S$ până la $Z$. Al doilea drum este format de la $Z$ până la $A$. Al treilea drum este format de la $Z$ până la $B$, unde $S$, $A$, $B$, $Z$ sunt definite anterior.

Fiecare drum se va tipări pe două linii separate:
- Pe prima linie va apărea lungimea drumului, adică numărul de muchii.
- Pe a doua linie vor apărea nodurile drumului, separate prin câte un spațiu.

Valorea asociată drumurilor, adică $max(t + t_A, t + t_B)$, trebuie să fie minimă.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 \leq S, A, B, Z \leq n \leq 5\ 000$
- Nodurile sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$.
- $A \neq B$
- $1 \leq m \leq n \times (n-1)$.
- Se garantează că pentru orice test dat spre rezolvare există cel puțin o soluție.
- Nu există muchii de la un nod la el însuși. Există maxim o muchie orientată între oricare două noduri distincte.
- Dacă verii se despart în $A$, primul văr poate să nu mai facă nimic (drumul lui ulterior ar avea $0$ muchii și l-ar conține doar pe $A$; vezi exemplul 3). Analog pentru $B$.
- Pentru fiecare subtask, testele cu $c = 1$ vor conta pentru $60\%$ din punctaj.
- Pentru 30 de puncte, $n \leq 500$, $m = n$ și toate muchiile sunt de forma $i \rightarrow (i\ mod\ n) + 1$, unde $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$.
- Pentru 50 de puncte, $n \leq 500$.
- Pentru 20 de puncte, $n \leq 5\ 000$ și $m \leq 4 \times n$.

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                path[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return dist, path

# A function to backtrack and find the path from end node to start node using path array
def get_path(end: int, path: List[int]) -> List[int]:

    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for _ in range(m):
        X, Y = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        graph[X].append(Y)

# Invoke BFS from S, A, and B respectively
distance_from_S, path_from_S = bfs(S, graph, n)
distance_from_A, _ = bfs(A, graph, n)
distance_from_B, _ = bfs(B, graph, n)

# Find the minimum time to cycle Z (the lowest common ancestor in BFS trees of A and B)
min_time = np.inf
for Z in range(1, n+1):
    if distance_from_A[Z] != -1 and distance_from_B[Z] != -1:
        time = distance_from_S[Z] + max(distance_from_A[Z], distance_from_B[Z])
        if time < min_time:
            min_time = time
            best_Z = Z

# Prepare the output
if c == 1:
    with open('veri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{min_time}\n")
else:
    path_to_Z = get_path(best_Z, path_from_S)
    path_Z_to_A = get_path(A, path_from_S)
    path_Z_to_B = get_path(B, path_from_S)
    # Adjust the path from Z if A or B is Z itself
    if path_Z_to_A[-1] == best_Z:
        path_Z_to_A.pop()

        file.write(f"{len(path_Z_to_B)}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, path_Z_to_B)) + '\n')
```

This code is an efficient solution to the stated problem. It uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest paths from the starting node S to all other nodes and separately from nodes A and B to all other nodes. It then determines the lowest common ancestor Z in the BFS trees from A and B such that the total time to cycle at Z and then proceed to A and B is minimized. For the output, it backtracks the paths to produce the required sequences when needed.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since numpy is not essential for this task and keeping in mind the memory constraints, I will rewrite the solution using only built-in Python libraries to ensure it does not exceed the memory limits.

This code does not use numpy and is thus free from dependencies that could cause import issues. It uses the built-in `collections.deque` for efficient queue operations during BFS and writes the results to 'veri.out' as required.

The error is caused by an attempt to use the variable `best_Z` without defining it in the case where no such Z is found that minimizes the time. This can happen if the initialization of `best_Z` is placed inside the loop and the conditions to set this variable are never met. To fix this, we should ensure that `best_Z` is initialized to a valid value before the loop, or handle the case where no valid Z is found.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from collections import deque

# A function to perform a BFS and return distances from a starting node
def bfs(start, graph):
    dist = [-1] * len(graph)
    queue = deque([start])
    dist[start] = 0

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                parents[neighbor] = node
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1

            best_Z = Z

```

This updated solution ensures that `best_Z` is initialized before the loop and checks after the loop to ensure that a valid value has been set. If no valid `best_Z` is found (which shouldn't happen with the stated guarantees in the problem), an error is raised. Paths to A and B are adjusted if A or B is the same as Z.

The error indicates that the condition to find a valid `best_Z` was never met, which caused the program to raise a `ValueError`. However, the problem statement guarantees that for any given test, there is at least one solution. This means that `best_Z` should always get a valid value during the loop, assuming the graph is constructed correctly and the BFS is implemented correctly.

Given that the error occurred, it's possible that there's a mistake in the code logic. Upon reviewing the code, I should not raise an error if a valid `best_Z` isn't found because the problem statement guarantees that a solution exists. Instead, I should revise the way the BFS is set up, particularly how the path reconstruction is handled, because if `best_Z` remains `-1`, it implies that the BFS did not find a valid path from `S` to either `A` or `B`. 

Let's revise the code to ensure that the BFS is correctly finding paths to `A` and `B`, and that `best_Z` is always assigned a value from the intersection of the sets of reachable nodes from `A` and `B`. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from collections import deque

# A function to perform a BFS and return distances and parents from a starting node
def bfs_with_parents(start, graph):
    dist = [-1] * len(graph)
    parents = [-1] * len(graph)
    queue = deque([start])
    dist[start] = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                parents[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return dist, parents

# Function to reconstruct the path from a destination node to a start node using parents
def reconstruct_path(parents, start, destination):
    path = []
    if destination == start:
        return [start]
    while destination != -1:
        path.append(destination)
        destination = parents[destination]
    return list(reversed(path))

    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for _ in range(m):
        X, Y = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        graph[X].append(Y)

# Perform BFS from S, A, and B
dist_S, parents_S = bfs_with_parents(S, graph)
dist_A, _ = bfs_with_parents(A, graph)
dist_B, _ = bfs_with_parents(B, graph)

# Find Z that minimizes the max(t + t_A, t + t_B)
min_time = float('inf')
best_Z = None
for Z in range(1, n+1):
    if dist_S[Z] != -1 and dist_A[Z] != -1 and dist_B[Z] != -1:
        time = dist_S[Z] + max(dist_A[Z], dist_B[Z])
        if time < min_time:
            min_time = time
            best_Z = Z

# If best_Z is not found, then it's guaranteed that A or B is the same as S
if best_Z is None:
    best_Z = S

# Write output data
with open('veri.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        file.write(str(min_time) + '\n')
    else:
        # Reconstruct paths
        path_to_Z = reconstruct_path(parents_S, S, best_Z)
        path_from_Z_to_A = reconstruct_path(parents_S, best_Z, A) if A != best_Z else [A]
        path_from_Z_to_B = reconstruct_path(parents_S, best_Z, B) if B != best_Z else [B]
        # Write the paths to the output file
        file.write(f"{len(path_to_Z)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_to_Z))}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(path_from_Z_to_A)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_from_Z_to_A))}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(path_from_Z_to_B)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_from_Z_to_B))}\n")
```

I've made adjustments to the BFS and path reconstruction functions to ensure they handle edge cases properly and that `best_Z` is assigned the value of `S` if no other meeting point is found. This is because `S` is a guaranteed point of convergence for both friends as they start from there. The assumption is that since there is a guaranteed solution, either there is a common ancestor Z different from S, or S itself is the point where the friends can split, i.e., one of them doesn't need to move.

The issue with the initial solution arises because it doesn't correctly account for the fact that the two friends can split after reaching a common point Z. The BFS implementation needs to track the paths leading to the meeting point and differentiate between the paths to A and B once the friends have split.

In the expected output, it is clear that the friends meet at node 5 and then move to their respective destinations, A (3) and B (4), separately. However, the found output suggests that they split immediately, which is incorrect.

To correct the solution, we need to find the shortest distance from S to all nodes for the common path, and then separately find the shortest distances from all nodes to both A and B to figure out where they should split (Z). After finding this splitting point, we can reconstruct the full paths for both friends.

Let's revise and rewrite the code with the correct logic:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, graph):
    dist = [-1] * len(graph)
    parents = [-1] * len(graph)
    queue = deque([start])
    dist[start] = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                parents[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return dist, parents

def reconstruct_path(parents, node):
    path = []
    while node != -1:
        path.append(node)
        node = parents[node]
    return path[::-1]

# Read input data
with open('veri.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    S, A, B = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for _ in range(m):
        X, Y = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        graph[X].append(Y)

# Perform BFS from S, A, and B to find the best splitting point
dist_S, parents_S = bfs(S, graph)
dist_A, _ = bfs(A, graph)
dist_B, _ = bfs(B, graph)

# Find the best node Z to split at
min_time = float('inf')
best_Z = -1
for Z in range(1, n+1):
    if dist_S[Z] != -1 and dist_A[Z] != -1 and dist_B[Z] != -1:
        time = dist_S[Z] + max(dist_A[Z], dist_B[Z])
        if time < min_time:
            min_time = time
            best_Z = Z

# Reconstruct the paths
path_to_Z = reconstruct_path(parents_S, best_Z)
path_Z_to_A = reconstruct_path(parents_S, A)[len(path_to_Z)-1:]  # Removing the common part
path_Z_to_B = reconstruct_path(parents_S, B)[len(path_to_Z)-1:]  # Removing the common part

# Write output data
with open('veri.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        file.write(f"{min_time}\n")
    else:
        file.write(f"{len(path_to_Z)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_to_Z))}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(path_Z_to_A)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_Z_to_A))}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(path_Z_to_B)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_Z_to_B))}\n")
```

This revised solution performs a BFS from S to identify the common path. It then performs individual BFS searches from A and B to find the best node to split at (Z). After identifying Z, it reconstructs the paths from Z to A and B, ensuring that the common path is not duplicated. Finally, it writes the appropriate output based on whether it's the first or second type of query.

Upon reviewing the expected and found output, the primary issue with the previous implementation is the incorrect reconstruction of the separate paths from Z to A and Z to B. The common path is calculated correctly, but the separate paths are not starting from Z. They need to be calculated from A to Z and B to Z, not the other way around.

Moreover, the reconstruction function was incorrectly called with the entire path from S to A and S to B, which includes the common path that the friends traveled together. The separate paths should start from Z (after the common path) to A and B.

Let's correct the solution by modifying the BFS to calculate distances and parents correctly, adjusting the reconstruction of separate paths from Z to A and Z to B, and ensuring the correct output format.

Here is the revised and corrected solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, graph):
    dist = [-1] * len(graph)
    parents = [-1] * len(graph)
    queue = deque([start])
    dist[start] = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                parents[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return dist, parents

def reconstruct_path(parents, node):
    if node == -1:
        return []
    path = [node]
    while parents[node] != -1:
        node = parents[node]
        path.append(node)
    return path[::-1]

# Read input data
with open('veri.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    S, A, B = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for _ in range(m):
        X, Y = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        graph[X].append(Y)

# Perform BFS from S, A, and B
dist_S, parents_S = bfs(S, graph)
dist_A, parents_A = bfs(A, graph)
dist_B, parents_B = bfs(B, graph)

# Find the best node Z to split at
min_time = float('inf')
best_Z = -1
for Z in range(1, n+1):
    if dist_S[Z] != -1 and dist_A[Z] != -1 and dist_B[Z] != -1:
        time = dist_S[Z] + max(dist_A[Z], dist_B[Z])
        if time < min_time:
            min_time = time
            best_Z = Z

# Reconstruct the paths
path_to_Z = reconstruct_path(parents_S, best_Z)
path_Z_to_A = reconstruct_path(parents_A, best_Z)
path_Z_to_B = reconstruct_path(parents_B, best_Z)

# Write output data
with open('veri.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        file.write(f"{min_time}\n")
    else:
        # Write the common path
        file.write(f"{len(path_to_Z) - 1}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_to_Z))}\n")
        # Write the path from Z to A
        if A != best_Z:
            path_Z_to_A = path_Z_to_A[:-1]  # Exclude Z itself for the path Z to A
        file.write(f"{len(path_Z_to_A)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_Z_to_A))}\n")
        # Write the path from Z to B
        if B != best_Z:
            path_Z_to_B = path_Z_to_B[:-1]  # Exclude Z itself for the path Z to B
        file.write(f"{len(path_Z_to_B)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path_Z_to_B))}\n")
```

This solution carefully reconstructs the paths to ensure that the separate paths from Z to A and Z to B are calculated correctly, and the common path is written correctly excluding Z for the separate paths. This fix should produce the expected output.

The issue with the current solution is that it still does not properly reconstruct the separate paths from the common split point Z to the destinations A and B. The reconstruction should consider that after splitting at Z, the friends can take entirely different paths to their destinations, which are not necessarily the reverse of the BFS paths from A and B to Z.

We need to perform BFS from A and B to determine the shortest path from Z to A and Z to B after the split and not include Z in the paths to A and B unless Z is equal to A or B. Additionally, we should ensure that the output formatting is correct, especially the lengths of the paths.

Let's correct the solution with the proper logic:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, graph):
    dist = [-1] * len(graph)
    parents = [-1] * len(graph)
    queue = deque([start])
    dist[start] = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                parents[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return dist, parents

def reconstruct_path(parents, start, end):
    path = []
    while end != start:
        path.append(end)
        end = parents[end]
    path.append(start)
    return path[::-1]

# Read input data
with open('veri.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    S, A, B = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for _ in range(m):
        X, Y = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        graph[X].append(Y)

# Perform BFS from S, A, and B
dist_S, parents_S = bfs(S, graph)
dist_A, parents_A = bfs(A, graph)
dist_B, parents_B = bfs(B, graph)

# Find the best node Z to split at
best_Z = -1
min_time = float('inf')
for Z in range(1, n+1):
    if dist_S[Z] != -1 and dist_A[Z] != -1 and dist_B[Z] != -1:
        max_time = max(dist_S[Z] + dist_A[Z], dist_S[Z] + dist_B[Z])
        if max_time < min_time:
            best_Z = Z
            min_time = max_time

# Reconstruct the paths
path_to_Z = reconstruct_path(parents_S, S, best_Z)

# Path from Z to A and B must be reconstructed separately
path_Z_to_A = reconstruct_path(parents_A, best_Z, A) if A != best_Z else [A]
path_Z_to_B = reconstruct_path(parents_B, best_Z, B) if B != best_Z else [B]

# Output the result
with open('veri.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        file.write(f"{min_time}\n")
    else:
        file.write(f"{len(path_to_Z)-1}\n")  # Exclude Z itself
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, path_to_Z)) + '\n')
        file.write(f"{len(path_Z_to_A)}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, path_Z_to_A)) + '\n')
        file.write(f"{len(path_Z_to_B)}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, path_Z_to_B)) + '\n')
```

In this corrected solution, BFS is used to find distances and parents from S, A, and B. It then finds the best Z, which is the node where the paths from S to A and S to B intersect and gives the minimum max time for both friends to reach their destinations. After finding Z, we reconstruct the path from S to Z. Then we separately reconstruct the paths from Z to A and Z to B, if Z is not the same as A or B. Finally, we write the correct output with the path lengths and nodes. This logic should now correctly handle the problem requirements and produce the expected output.
