Considerăm un număr întreg $N$ și un șir de $M$ cifre zecimale nenule. Să se determine dacă numărul $N$ poate fi rezultatul unei expresii aritmetice simple (fără paranteze), formată exclusiv din cifrele șirului citit și din operatorii aritmetici desemnați pentru operațiile de adunare și scădere ($+, -$).

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care citește numerele $N$ și $M$ de pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare și șirul de $M$ cifre de pe linia următoare și determină și afișează expresia găsită sau valoarea 0 în cazul în care nu există soluție.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `adunscad.in` conține pe prima linie numerele întregi $N \ M$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând valoarea ce trebuie obținută la evaluarea expresiei și numărul de cifre din șir. Linia a doua a fișierului de intrare conține șirul celor $M$ cifre nenule, separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `adunscad.out` va conține pe prima linie expresia determinată, în cazul în care există soluție, sau valoarea $0$ în cazul în care nu există soluție.

# Restricții și precizări

* $-180 \leq N \leq 180$;
* $2 \leq M \leq 20$;
* În șirul citit cifrele se pot repeta.
* Toate cifrele din șir trebuie să apară și în expresia aritmetică, în aceeași ordine în care au fost citite.
* În expresia aritmetică, orice cifră trebuie să fie precedată de un operator; în cazul în care prima cifră este precedată de operatorul + acesta nu se pune în expresie. În expresia aritmetică nu există spații.
* În cazul în care soluția nu este unică se va afișa o soluție corectă.

This Python code snippet efficiently solves the given problem by first reading the input from `adunscad.in`, finding all possible operator combinations between the digits, and then evaluating each combination to see if it equals the target number N. If such a combination is found, the corresponding expression is constructed and written to `adunscad.out`.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the task requires us to optimize both time and memory usage, and there is a memory constraint, it's better to avoid using `numpy` since the task can be accomplished with built-in modules.

Let's rewrite the entire solution without `numpy` and optimize it further to ensure that it uses minimal memory:

```python
from itertools import product

# Function to check if the expression can be evaluated to N
def can_evaluate_to_N(digits, operators, N):
    expression = "".join(d + o for d, o in zip(digits, operators)) + digits[-1]
    return eval(expression) == N

# Read the input from adunscad.in
with open("adunscad.in", "r") as file:
    N, M = map(int, file.readline().split())
    # We can store digits as a string to avoid separate space allocation for each digit
    digits = file.readline().strip().replace(" ", "")

# Generate all possible combinations of + and - of length M-1
possible_operators = product("+-", repeat=M-1)

# Find a valid expression
expression_found = False
for ops in possible_operators:
    if can_evaluate_to_N(digits, ops, N):
        # Construct the expression with the found operators
        expression = digits[0]
        for i in range(M - 1):
            expression += ops[i] + digits[i + 1]
        expression_found = True
        break

# Write the output to adunscad.out
with open("adunscad.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(expression if expression_found else "0")
```

This script does the following:
1. Reads from `adunscad.in` without using `numpy`.
2. Utilizes `itertools.product` to generate combinations of operators.
3. Uses built-in Python functions to check if an expression evaluates to N.
4. Writes to `adunscad.out` with the found expression, or "0" if no expression is found.

By storing digits as a single string and avoiding additional memory usage via `numpy`, we should remain within the ~8MB memory constraint.

Upon reviewing the results, the provided solution failed to produce the correct output for the given input. The issue lies with how the `can_evaluate_to_N` function handles negative target numbers (N) and the order of concatenation of digits with operators.

The `eval` function correctly evaluates the expressions with the chosen operator combinations, but our approach to construct the expression did not consider that a negative target value (`-1` in the given input) requires the entire expression to start with a minus sign, unless the first digit can be subtracted from the sum of the others to reach the target. This is an edge case that our initial solution did not cover.

Here's how we can fix the issue:

1. We will check for a valid expression that evaluates to the target N by trying all possible combinations of '+' and '-' operators between the digits.
2. The combination process should also account for the possibility of starting with a negative number if the target N is negative and the first digit is greater than the target.
3. We will iterate through all combinations and use the `eval` function to check if the current combination results in the target N.

Here is the updated solution:

```python
from itertools import product

# Function to generate the expression string based on digits and operators
def generate_expression(digits, operators):
    return "".join(d + o for d, o in zip(digits, operators)) + digits[-1]

# Function to check if the expression can be evaluated to N
def can_evaluate_to_N(expression, N):
    try:
        return eval(expression) == N
    except SyntaxError:
        return False

# Read the input from adunscad.in
with open("adunscad.in", "r") as file:
    N, M = map(int, file.readline().split())
    digits = file.readline().strip().split()

# Generate all possible combinations of + and - of length M-1
possible_operators = product("+-", repeat=M-1)

# Find a valid expression
expression = "0"
for ops in possible_operators:
    exp = generate_expression(digits, ops)
    if can_evaluate_to_N(exp, N):
        expression = exp.lstrip('+')  # Remove leading '+' if any
        break

# Write the output to adunscad.out
with open("adunscad.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(expression)
```

The updated solution should work correctly for both positive and negative target values. It constructs each possible expression and checks if it evaluates to the target N, including expressions that begin with a minus sign.

The provided solution still fails to produce the correct output because it does not correctly handle the possibility of a negative starting digit if the target number N is negative. We need to modify the approach to handle this case correctly.

The problem lies in the `generate_expression` function, which we assumed would always concatenate the digits and operators correctly. However, for a negative N, the first digit might need to be negative, which is not taken into account by the `generate_expression` function.

We need to adjust the algorithm to consider the first digit as potentially negative and generate expressions accordingly. Here's how we can do this:

- We can prepend a '+' or a '-' to the sequence of operators, effectively considering the first digit as positive or negative.
- We will iterate through all combinations of operators, including the possibility of the first digit being negative.
- For each combination, we will generate the expression string and use `eval` to check if it results in the target N.

Here is the updated solution that takes this into account:

```python
from itertools import product

# Function to generate the expression string based on digits and operators
def generate_expression(digits, operators):
    return "".join(d + o for d, o in zip(digits, operators))

# Function to check if the expression can be evaluated to N
def can_evaluate_to_N(expression, N):
    try:
        return eval(expression) == N
    except SyntaxError:
        return False

# Read the input from adunscad.in
with open("adunscad.in", "r") as file:
    N, M = map(int, file.readline().split())
    digits = file.readline().strip().split()

# Prepare for generating all possible operator combinations
# Including an extra slot for the potential negative sign at the start if N is negative
if N < 0 and int(digits[0]) > abs(N):
    possible_operators = product("+-", repeat=M)
    digits = ["0"] + digits  # Prepend a dummy zero to align operators with digits
else:
    possible_operators = product("+-", repeat=M-1)

# Find a valid expression
expression = "0"
for ops in possible_operators:
    # Generate the expression for the current combination of operators
    exp = generate_expression(digits, ops)
    if can_evaluate_to_N(exp, N):
        expression = exp.lstrip('+')  # Remove leading '+' if any
        break

# Write the output to adunscad.out
with open("adunscad.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(expression)
```

This solution now correctly handles the case where the target number N is negative, and the first digit needs to be negative to achieve the correct result. It should now give the correct output for inputs like `-1 4 1 2 3 5`, resulting in `-1+2+3-5`.

The solution is still not producing the correct result, and the problem lies within the way we are generating operator combinations and constructing the expressions. We were not careful enough to ensure that we could start with the first digit being positive without an explicit '+' operator, which is allowed according to the problem conditions.

We need to adjust the approach to ensure the first digit can naturally be considered positive without an operator, or explicitly negative if the operator is a '-'.

We will write a new solution that:

1. Iterates through all possible combinations of operators, including an optional negative sign at the start.
2. Constructs the expression carefully, taking into account the rules regarding the leading '+' being optional.
3. Evaluates the expression to check if it equals the target number N.
4. Writes the first found valid expression to the output, or "0" if no valid expression is found.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
from itertools import product

# Function to generate the expression string based on digits and operators
def generate_expression(digits, operators):
    # Include an operator only if it's not a leading '+'
    return "".join(d + (o if i != 0 or o == '-' else '') for i, (d, o) in enumerate(zip(digits, operators)))

# Function to check if the expression can be evaluated to N
def can_evaluate_to_N(expression, N):
    try:
        return eval(expression) == N
    except SyntaxError:
        return False

# Read the input from adunscad.in
with open("adunscad.in", "r") as file:
    N, M = map(int, file.readline().split())
    digits = file.readline().strip().split()

# Generate all possible combinations of + and - of length M
possible_operators = product("+-", repeat=M)

# Find a valid expression
expression = "0"
for ops in possible_operators:
    # Generate the expression for the current combination of operators
    # We skip the first operator if it is a '+', but not if it is a '-'
    exp = generate_expression(digits, ops)
    if can_evaluate_to_N(exp, N):
        expression = exp
        break

# Write the output to adunscad.out
with open("adunscad.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(expression)
```

This revised solution should now properly account for the rules of the problem, correctly generate all possible expressions, and output the first one that evaluates to the target value N. It should work for all test cases, including both the failing case and the original example.

The previous solution still did not produce the correct result because it generated combinations for M operators when we only need M-1 operators (since we have M digits and only need an operator between each pair of digits). Also, the code incorrectly placed operators before every digit, but the problem specifies that operators should only be placed between digits.

According to the problem statement, the expression should not start with an operator unless it starts with a minus sign. The first digit does not need an operator before it (unless it's negative), and the number of operators should be M-1 for M digits.

Here is an updated solution that should address these issues:

```python
from itertools import product

# Function to try inserting operators between digits and evaluate the expression
def find_expression(digits, target):
    # Generate all possible combinations of '-' and '+' of length M-1
    for operators in product('+-', repeat=len(digits)-1):
        # Construct an expression string by interleaving digits with operators
        expression = digits[0]
        for digit, operator in zip(digits[1:], operators):
            expression += operator + digit
        
        # Evaluate the expression to see if it meets the target
        if eval(expression) == target:
            return expression
    return None

# Read the input from adunscad.in
with open("adunscad.in", "r") as file:
    target, M = map(int, file.readline().split())
    digits = file.readline().strip().split()

# Attempt to find a valid expression that evaluates to the target
expression = find_expression(digits, target)

# Write the output to adunscad.out
with open("adunscad.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(expression if expression else "0")
```

This solution iterates through each possible combination of '+' and '-' operators, correctly placing them between the digits. If it finds a combination that evaluates to the target number, it writes that expression to "adunscad.out". If no such expression is found, it writes "0". This solution should work for the given input as well as other test cases.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not consider the fact that the target number can be negative, and in such cases, the expression can start with a negative sign. Therefore, we need to adjust the solution to handle this case explicitly.

To fix this, we need to extend the operator combinations to include the possibility that the first digit could be negative. We do this by prepending a negative sign to the first digit and then trying all combinations of the remaining operators.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from itertools import product

# Function to insert operators between digits and evaluate the expression
def find_expression(digits, target):
    # Generate all possible combinations of '-' and '+' of length M-1
    for operators in product('+-', repeat=len(digits)-1):
        # Check the expression without modifying the first digit
        expression = digits[0]
        for digit, operator in zip(digits[1:], operators):
            expression += operator + digit
        if eval(expression) == target:
            return expression
        
        # Check the expression with a negative first digit if the target is negative
        if target < 0 and int(digits[0]) > abs(target):
            expression = '-' + digits[0]
            for digit, operator in zip(digits[1:], operators):
                expression += operator + digit
            if eval(expression) == target:
                return expression
    return None

# Read the input from adunscad.in
with open("adunscad.in", "r") as file:
    target, M = map(int, file.readline().split())
    digits = file.readline().strip().split()

# Attempt to find a valid expression that evaluates to the target
expression = find_expression(digits, target)

# Write the output to adunscad.out
with open("adunscad.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(expression if expression else "0")
```

This solution considers both possibilities: when the first digit is part of a positive number and when the first digit is negative. It checks for both cases only if the target number is negative and the first digit is greater than the absolute value of the target. This way the solution considers all possibilities and should produce the correct output.
