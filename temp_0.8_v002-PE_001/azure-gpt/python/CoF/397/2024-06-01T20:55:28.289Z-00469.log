Să considerăm ecuaţii de gradul I, de forma: `expresie_1=expresie_2`. Expresiile specificate sunt constituite dintr-o succesiune de operanzi, între care există semnul `+` sau semnul `-` (cu semnificaţia binecunoscută de adunare, respectiv scădere). Fiecare operand este fie un număr natural, fie un număr natural urmat de litera `x` (litera `x` reprezentând necunoscuta), fie doar litera `x` (ceea ce este echivalent cu `1x`).

De exemplu: `2x-5+10x+4=20-x`. Observaţi că în ecuaţiile noastre nu apar paranteze şi necunoscuta este întotdeauna desemnată de litera mică `x`.

# Cerința

Scrieţi un program care să rezolve ecuaţii de gradul I, în formatul specificat în enunţul problemei.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ecuatii.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de ecuaţii din fişier. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii este scrisă câte o ecuaţie.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ecuatii.out` va conține $n$ linii, câte una pentru fiecare ecuaţie din fişierul de intrare. Pe linia $i$ va fi scrisă soluţia ecuaţiei de pe linia $i+1$ din fişierul de intrare.

Dacă soluţia ecuaţiei este un număr real, atunci acesta se va scrie cu 4 zecimale. Răspunsul este considerat corect dacă diferenţa în valoare absolută dintre soluţia corectă şi soluţia concurentului este < 0.001.

În cazul în care ecuaţia admite o infinitate de soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `infinit` (cu litere mici).

Dacă ecuaţia nu admite soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `imposibil` (de asemenea cu litere mici).

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 10$;
* Lungimea unei ecuaţii nu depăşeşte 255 caractere;
* Ecuaţiile nu conţin spaţii;
* Numerele naturale care intervin în ecuaţii sunt $\leq 1000$.

solutions = [solve_equation(eq) for eq in equations]

with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as outfile:
    for solution in solutions:
        outfile.write(solution + '\n')
```

This code snippet parses the equations, calculates the coefficients for x and the constant terms, checks for special cases (infinite solutions or no solutions), and writes the results to an output file. It uses regular expressions to efficiently parse the equations and standard file I/O operations for reading and writing files. This should meet the requirements for time and memory efficiency, as well as the input/output specifications.

The program has exited with code 1 due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'numpy'. This indicates that the numpy library is not installed or not found in the execution environment. However, analyzing the program, it appears that numpy is not actually used in the provided code snippet, so we can simply remove the import statement for numpy to fix the program.

Here is the revised solution without the numpy import:

```python
import re

# Function to parse each equation and solve it
def solve_equation(equation):
    # Split the equation into its two sides
    left_side, right_side = equation.split("=")
    
    # Function to parse sides of the equation
    def parse_side(side):
        # Find all the x terms and constants
        x_terms = [int(match[:-1]) if match[-1] == "x" else int(match + "1") for match in re.findall(r"[\+\-]?\d*x", side)]
        constants = [int(match) for match in re.findall(r"[\+\-]?\d+(?![x])", side)]
        
        # Sum x terms and constants separately
        return (sum(x_terms), sum(constants))
    
    # Parse both sides
    left_x, left_const = parse_side(left_side)
    right_x, right_const = parse_side(right_side)

    # Calculate the net coefficients for x and constant
    net_x_coef = left_x - right_x
    net_const = right_const - left_const

    # Check for infinite solutions or no solution
    if net_x_coef == 0:
        if net_const == 0:
            return "infinit"
        else:
            return "imposibil"
    
    # Calculate and return the solution
    return f"{net_const / net_x_coef:.4f}"

# Read equations from file, solve them, and write solutions to file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as infile:
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    equations = [infile.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

solutions = [solve_equation(eq) for eq in equations]

with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as outfile:
    for solution in solutions:
        outfile.write(solution + '\n')
```

This revised solution removes the unnecessary import of numpy and should run without any import-related errors. It still efficiently solves the equations by parsing and solving them while adhering to the memory constraints. It reads from 'ecuatii.in' and writes the results to 'ecuatii.out', as per the original requirements.

The program is exiting with code 1 because of a `ValueError`. The error is occurring due to an incorrect attempt to convert an empty string to an integer. This happens when the regular expression finds a term with 'x' but without a preceding coefficient, like 'x' itself, which should be interpreted as '1x'.

To fix this, we need to modify the list comprehension inside the `parse_side` function to correctly handle terms with 'x' that do not have a visible coefficient. If the term ends with 'x' and the part before 'x' is an empty string, we should use '1' as the coefficient. Also, note that if we have a negative sign followed by 'x', this should be interpreted as '-1x'.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
import re

# Function to parse each equation and solve it
def solve_equation(equation):
    # Split the equation into its two sides
    left_side, right_side = equation.split("=")
    
    # Function to parse sides of the equation
    def parse_side(side):
        # Find all the x terms and constants
        x_terms = [int(match[:-1]) if match[:-1] else 1 for match in re.findall(r"[\+\-]?\d*x", side)]
        constants = [int(match) for match in re.findall(r"[\+\-]?\d+(?![x])", side)]
        
        # Sum x terms and constants separately
        return (sum(x_terms), sum(constants))
    
    # Parse both sides
    left_x, left_const = parse_side(left_side)
    right_x, right_const = parse_side(right_side)

    # Calculate the net coefficients for x and constant
    net_x_coef = left_x - right_x
    net_const = right_const - left_const

    # Check for infinite solutions or no solution
    if net_x_coef == 0:
        if net_const == 0:
            return "infinit"
        else:
            return "imposibil"
    
    # Calculate and return the solution
    return f"{net_const / net_x_coef:.4f}"

# Read equations from file, solve them, and write solutions to file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as infile:
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    equations = [infile.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

solutions = [solve_equation(eq) for eq in equations]

with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as outfile:
    for solution in solutions:
        outfile.write(solution + '\n')
```

This corrected version handles the case where 'x' appears without a coefficient by assuming the coefficient to be 1, and it also handles the case with a negative sign, interpreting it as '-1'. This should resolve the `ValueError` and allow the program to run successfully.

The problem is due to the incorrect handling of the sign before 'x' in the regular expression matches. When a match contains just '+x' or '-x', the `int(match[:-1])` will fail because it tries to convert '+' or '-' to an integer, which is invalid. We need to correctly interpret '+x' as '1' and '-x' as '-1'.

Let's fix the list comprehension to handle the sign properly:

```python
import re

# Function to parse each equation and solve it
def solve_equation(equation):
    # Split the equation into its two sides
    left_side, right_side = equation.split("=")
    
    # Function to parse sides of the equation
    def parse_side(side):
        # Find all the x terms and constants
        x_terms = [int(match[:-1]) if match[:-1] not in ('', '+', '-') else (1 if match[-2:] != '-x' else -1) for match in re.findall(r"[\+\-]?\d*x", side)]
        constants = [int(match) for match in re.findall(r"[\+\-]?\d+(?![x])", side)]
        
        # Sum x terms and constants separately
        return (sum(x_terms), sum(constants))
    
    # Parse both sides
    left_x, left_const = parse_side(left_side)
    right_x, right_const = parse_side(right_side)

    # Calculate the net coefficients for x and constant
    net_x_coef = left_x - right_x
    net_const = right_const - left_const

    # Check for infinite solutions or no solution
    if net_x_coef == 0:
        if net_const == 0:
            return "infinit"
        else:
            return "imposibil"
    
    # Calculate and return the solution
    return f"{net_const / net_x_coef:.4f}"

# Read equations from file, solve them, and write solutions to file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as infile:
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    equations = [infile.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

solutions = [solve_equation(eq) for eq in equations]

with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as outfile:
    for solution in solutions:
        outfile.write(solution + '\n')
```

In this corrected code, we now check if the section before 'x' is empty, '+', or '-', and correctly interpret the coefficient as 1 or -1 based on the sign. This should properly handle all the cases and avoid the `ValueError`. The program should now run successfully and solve the equations.
