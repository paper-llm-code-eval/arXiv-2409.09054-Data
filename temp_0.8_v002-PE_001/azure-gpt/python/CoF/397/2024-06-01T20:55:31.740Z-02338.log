Să considerăm ecuaţii de gradul I, de forma: `expresie_1=expresie_2`. Expresiile specificate sunt constituite dintr-o succesiune de operanzi, între care există semnul `+` sau semnul `-` (cu semnificaţia binecunoscută de adunare, respectiv scădere). Fiecare operand este fie un număr natural, fie un număr natural urmat de litera `x` (litera `x` reprezentând necunoscuta), fie doar litera `x` (ceea ce este echivalent cu `1x`).

De exemplu: `2x-5+10x+4=20-x`. Observaţi că în ecuaţiile noastre nu apar paranteze şi necunoscuta este întotdeauna desemnată de litera mică `x`.

# Cerința

Scrieţi un program care să rezolve ecuaţii de gradul I, în formatul specificat în enunţul problemei.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ecuatii.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de ecuaţii din fişier. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii este scrisă câte o ecuaţie.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ecuatii.out` va conține $n$ linii, câte una pentru fiecare ecuaţie din fişierul de intrare. Pe linia $i$ va fi scrisă soluţia ecuaţiei de pe linia $i+1$ din fişierul de intrare.

Dacă soluţia ecuaţiei este un număr real, atunci acesta se va scrie cu 4 zecimale. Răspunsul este considerat corect dacă diferenţa în valoare absolută dintre soluţia corectă şi soluţia concurentului este < 0.001.

În cazul în care ecuaţia admite o infinitate de soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `infinit` (cu litere mici).

Dacă ecuaţia nu admite soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `imposibil` (de asemenea cu litere mici).

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 10$;
* Lungimea unei ecuaţii nu depăşeşte 255 caractere;
* Ecuaţiile nu conţin spaţii;
* Numerele naturale care intervin în ecuaţii sunt $\leq 1000$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np
import re

def solve_equation(equation):
    # Regular expressions to find all occurrences of terms with 'x' and constants

    # Split the equation into left and right parts
    left_side, right_side = equation.split('=')

    # Find all x terms and constant terms separately for both sides
    left_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(left_side)
    left_const_terms = pattern_const.findall(left_side)
    right_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(right_side)

        const = sum(int(term) for term in const_terms)
        return x_coeff, const

    # Simplify both sides of the equation
    left_x, left_const = simplify_terms(left_x_terms, left_const_terms)
    right_x, right_const = simplify_terms(right_x_terms, right_const_terms)

    # Move all x terms to the left side and all constant terms to the right side of the equation
    x_coeff = left_x - right_x
    const_sum = right_const - left_const

    # If the x coefficient is zero, check if we have infinite solutions or no solution
    if x_coeff == 0:
        if const_sum == 0:
            return "infinit"
        else:
            return "imposibil"
    else:
        # Otherwise, find the solution by dividing the constants sum by the x coefficient
        return f"{const_sum / x_coeff:.4f}"

# Read input data from file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    equations = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Open the output file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    # Solve each equation and write the solution to the output file
    for eq in equations:
        solution = solve_equation(eq)
        file.write(solution + '\n')
```

This script solves the challenge by defining a function that takes an equation as input, processes it with regex to separate terms, simplifies each side, and then finds the solution. It reads from the `ecuatii.in` file and writes to the `ecuatii.out` file. The script optimizes for memory usage by avoiding unnecessary storage of intermediate values and sticking to simple data types and operations.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the code is running. However, `numpy` is not actually needed for solving this problem, as the problem can be solved using standard Python libraries.

Here is the fixed solution without the `numpy` import:

```python
import re

def solve_equation(equation):
    # Regular expressions to find all occurrences of terms with 'x' and constants
    pattern_x = re.compile(r'([+-]? *\d*x)')
    pattern_const = re.compile(r'([+-]? *\d+)(?!x)')

    # Split the equation into left and right parts
    left_side, right_side = equation.split('=')

    # Find all x terms and constant terms separately for both sides
    left_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(left_side)
    left_const_terms = pattern_const.findall(left_side)
    right_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(right_side)
    right_const_terms = pattern_const.findall(right_side)

    # Function to simplify the terms by summing all the coefficients with 'x' and all the constants
    def simplify_terms(x_terms, const_terms):
        x_coeff = sum(int(term.replace('x', '1' if term[:-1].strip() == '' else term[:-1])) for term in x_terms)
        const = sum(int(term) for term in const_terms)
        return x_coeff, const

    # Simplify both sides of the equation
    left_x, left_const = simplify_terms(left_x_terms, left_const_terms)
    right_x, right_const = simplify_terms(right_x_terms, right_const_terms)

    # Move all x terms to the left side and all constant terms to the right side of the equation
    x_coeff = left_x - right_x
    const_sum = right_const - left_const

    # If the x coefficient is zero, check if we have infinite solutions or no solution
    if x_coeff == 0:
        if const_sum == 0:
            return "infinit"
        else:
            return "imposibil"
    else:
        # Otherwise, find the solution by dividing the constants sum by the x coefficient
        return f"{const_sum / x_coeff:.4f}"

# Read input data from file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    equations = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Open the output file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    # Solve each equation and write the solution to the output file
    for eq in equations:
        solution = solve_equation(eq)
        file.write(solution + '\n')
```

This solution should work within the given memory constraints and without the use of `numpy`.

Based on the error message, the program is failing because the `int` conversion is being attempted on a string that contains non-numeric characters like `+`. This could occur if the regex pattern is not capturing terms correctly or if the string manipulation in the list comprehension is not handling the terms correctly.

We can fix the regex pattern or improve the string manipulation in the list comprehension to ensure only valid integers are passed to the `int` function. Here is the revised solution:

```python
import re

def solve_equation(equation):
    # Regular expressions to find all occurrences of terms with 'x' and constants
    pattern_x = re.compile(r'([+-]?\d*)x')
    pattern_const = re.compile(r'([+-]?\d+)(?![x\d])')

    # Split the equation into left and right parts
    left_side, right_side = equation.split('=')

    # Find all x terms and constant terms separately for both sides
    left_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(left_side)
    left_const_terms = pattern_const.findall(left_side)
    right_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(right_side)
    right_const_terms = pattern_const.findall(right_side)

    # Function to simplify the terms by summing all the coefficients with 'x' and all the constants
    def simplify_terms(x_terms, const_terms):
        x_coeff = sum(int(term if term and term != '+' and term != '-' else '1' if term == '+' else '-1') for term in x_terms)
        const = sum(int(term) for term in const_terms)
        return x_coeff, const

    # Simplify both sides of the equation
    left_x, left_const = simplify_terms(left_x_terms, left_const_terms)
    right_x, right_const = simplify_terms(right_x_terms, right_const_terms)

    # Move all x terms to the left side and all constant terms to the right side of the equation
    x_coeff = left_x - right_x
    const_sum = right_const - left_const

    # If the x coefficient is zero, check if we have infinite solutions or no solution
    if x_coeff == 0:
        if const_sum == 0:
            return "infinit"
        else:
            return "imposibil"
    else:
        # Otherwise, find the solution by dividing the constants sum by the x coefficient
        return f"{const_sum / x_coeff:.4f}"

# Read input data from file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    equations = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Open the output file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    # Solve each equation and write the solution to the output file
    for eq in equations:
        solution = solve_equation(eq)
        file.write(solution + '\n')
```

The changes I've made include improving the regex patterns to correctly capture terms with and without 'x', and also adjusting the list comprehension in the `simplify_terms` function to handle cases where the term is just a sign (e.g., '+' or '-') which is equivalent to '+1' or '-1'. This solution should handle the parsing more robustly and prevent similar errors.

The difference in the expected and found output is due to the second equation "x+2=2+x", which has infinite solutions. The correct output should be "infinit", but the current solution incorrectly gives "-0.0000".

The issue comes from the way we are handling equations with equal coefficients for 'x' on both sides. Our current check for infinite solutions is not sufficient, as it only checks if both the x coefficient and the constants sum to zero. The correct check should be if the x coefficient is zero, then we look at the constant sum to determine if the equation has no solution or infinite solutions.

We need to adjust the logic in the `solve_equation` function to handle this case properly.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
import re

def solve_equation(equation):
    # Regular expressions to find all occurrences of terms with 'x' and constants
    pattern_x = re.compile(r'([+-]? *\d*)x')
    pattern_const = re.compile(r'([+-]? *\d+)(?![x\d])')

    # Split the equation into left and right parts
    left_side, right_side = equation.split('=')

    # Find all x terms and constant terms separately for both sides
    left_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(left_side)
    left_const_terms = pattern_const.findall(left_side)
    right_x_terms = pattern_x.findall(right_side)
    right_const_terms = pattern_const.findall(right_side)

    # Function to simplify the terms by summing all the coefficients with 'x' and all the constants
    def simplify_terms(x_terms, const_terms):
        x_coeff = sum(int(term.strip() + '1' if 'x' in term else term.strip()) for term in x_terms if term.strip() != '')
        const = sum(int(term) for term in const_terms)
        return x_coeff, const

    # Simplify both sides of the equation
    left_x, left_const = simplify_terms(left_x_terms, left_const_terms)
    right_x, right_const = simplify_terms(right_x_terms, right_const_terms)

    # Move all x terms to the left side and all constant terms to the right side of the equation
    x_coeff = left_x - right_x
    const_sum = right_const - left_const

    # If the x coefficient is zero, check if we have infinite solutions or no solution
    if x_coeff == 0:
        if const_sum == 0:
            return "infinit"
        else:
            return "imposibil"
    else:
        # Otherwise, find the solution by dividing the constants sum by the x coefficient
        return f"{const_sum / x_coeff:.4f}"

# Read input data from file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    equations = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Open the output file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    # Solve each equation and write the solution to the output file
    for eq in equations:
        solution = solve_equation(eq)
        file.write(solution + '\n')
```

This revised solution should correctly identify infinite solutions for equations with an x coefficient of zero and a constant sum of zero, and output "infinit" in those cases, as expected.
