Să considerăm ecuaţii de gradul I, de forma: `expresie_1=expresie_2`. Expresiile specificate sunt constituite dintr-o succesiune de operanzi, între care există semnul `+` sau semnul `-` (cu semnificaţia binecunoscută de adunare, respectiv scădere). Fiecare operand este fie un număr natural, fie un număr natural urmat de litera `x` (litera `x` reprezentând necunoscuta), fie doar litera `x` (ceea ce este echivalent cu `1x`).

De exemplu: `2x-5+10x+4=20-x`. Observaţi că în ecuaţiile noastre nu apar paranteze şi necunoscuta este întotdeauna desemnată de litera mică `x`.

# Cerința

Scrieţi un program care să rezolve ecuaţii de gradul I, în formatul specificat în enunţul problemei.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ecuatii.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de ecuaţii din fişier. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii este scrisă câte o ecuaţie.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ecuatii.out` va conține $n$ linii, câte una pentru fiecare ecuaţie din fişierul de intrare. Pe linia $i$ va fi scrisă soluţia ecuaţiei de pe linia $i+1$ din fişierul de intrare.

Dacă soluţia ecuaţiei este un număr real, atunci acesta se va scrie cu 4 zecimale. Răspunsul este considerat corect dacă diferenţa în valoare absolută dintre soluţia corectă şi soluţia concurentului este < 0.001.

În cazul în care ecuaţia admite o infinitate de soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `infinit` (cu litere mici).

Dacă ecuaţia nu admite soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `imposibil` (de asemenea cu litere mici).

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 10$;
* Lungimea unei ecuaţii nu depăşeşte 255 caractere;
* Ecuaţiile nu conţin spaţii;
* Numerele naturale care intervin în ecuaţii sunt $\leq 1000$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# We start by importing the NumPy library which will help us in handling arrays efficiently
import numpy as np

# Function to parse the equation into a format that can be easily worked with
def parse_equation(equation):
    # Separate the equation into left and right parts
    left_side, right_side = equation.split('=')
    
    # Normalize by bringing everything to one side of the equation
    normalized_eq = left_side + '-(' + right_side + ')'
    
    # Replace '--' with '+' to simplify further processing
    normalized_eq = normalized_eq.replace('--', '+')
    
    # Split the equation into terms
    terms = normalized_eq.replace('-', '+-').split('+')
    
    # Initialize coefficients for 'x' and the constant term
    x_coefficient, constant = 0, 0
    
    # Loop over each term to calculate the coefficients
    for term in terms:
        if 'x' in term:
            # If 'x' is present, it's either 'x' or 'nx' where n is a number
            if term == 'x':
                x_coefficient += 1
            else:
                x_coefficient += int(term[:-1])
        elif term:
            # It's a constant term
            constant += int(term)
    
    return x_coefficient, constant

# Function to solve the equation
def solve_equation(x_coefficient, constant):
    if x_coefficient == 0 and constant == 0:
        return 'infinit'
    elif x_coefficient == 0:
        return 'imposibil'
    else:
        return f"{-constant / x_coefficient:.4f}"

# Open the input file and read the equations
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    # Read the number of equations
    num_equations = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Read each equation and solve it
    solutions = [solve_equation(*parse_equation(file.readline().strip())) for _ in range(num_equations)]

# Write the solutions to the output file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(solution + '\n' for solution in solutions)
```

This code reads the number of equations from the input file, then for each equation, it normalizes it by bringing all terms to one side and replaces '--' with '+'. Next, it calculates the coefficients for 'x' and the constant and solves the equation accordingly. If the equation has infinite solutions or is impossible, it prints the respective message. Otherwise, it prints the solution with four decimal places. The solutions are then written to the output file.

Please save this script and the given `ecuatii.in` in the same directory and run the script to produce the `ecuatii.out` file with the correct solutions.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which means it is not installed in the environment where the script is being run. However, since the script I provided doesn't actually use `numpy` and does not make heavy computations that require `numpy`, we can simply remove the import statement for `numpy` as it is unnecessary.

Here is the corrected version of the script, without the import statement for `numpy`:

```python
# Function to parse the equation into a format that can be easily worked with
def parse_equation(equation):
    # Separate the equation into left and right parts
    left_side, right_side = equation.split('=')
    
    # Normalize by bringing everything to one side of the equation
    normalized_eq = left_side + '-(' + right_side + ')'
    
    # Replace '--' with '+' to simplify further processing
    normalized_eq = normalized_eq.replace('--', '+')
    
    # Split the equation into terms
    terms = normalized_eq.replace('-', '+-').split('+')
    
    # Initialize coefficients for 'x' and the constant term
    x_coefficient, constant = 0, 0
    
    # Loop over each term to calculate the coefficients
    for term in terms:
        if 'x' in term:
            # If 'x' is present, it's either 'x' or 'nx' where n is a number
            if term == 'x':
                x_coefficient += 1
            else:
                x_coefficient += int(term[:-1])
        elif term:
            # It's a constant term
            constant += int(term)
    
    return x_coefficient, constant

# Function to solve the equation
def solve_equation(x_coefficient, constant):
    if x_coefficient == 0 and constant == 0:
        return 'infinit'
    elif x_coefficient == 0:
        return 'imposibil'
    else:
        return f"{-constant / x_coefficient:.4f}"

# Open the input file and read the equations
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    # Read the number of equations
    num_equations = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Read each equation and solve it
    solutions = [solve_equation(*parse_equation(file.readline().strip())) for _ in range(num_equations)]

# Write the solutions to the output file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(solution + '\n' for solution in solutions)
```

Now the script does not include any unnecessary module imports and should work correctly in an environment without `numpy`. Just make sure to save this script in the same directory as the `ecuatii.in` file and run it to produce the correct `ecuatii.out` file.

The issue in the code is caused by attempting to convert a string that contains non-numeric characters to an integer. Specifically, the string `'-('` is being passed to the `int()` function because the normalization step that converts the right-hand side of the equation into a subtraction is incorrect. The code is not correctly handling the parentheses, which are meant to reverse the signs of the terms on the right-hand side of the equation.

Instead of using parentheses, we should simply reverse the signs of the terms on the right-hand side. We can do this by prepending a minus sign to each term after splitting the right-hand side.

Here is the corrected version of the script, which now properly normalizes the equation by reversing the signs of the right-hand side:

```python
# Function to parse the equation into a format that can be easily worked with
def parse_equation(equation):
    # Separate the equation into left and right parts
    left_side, right_side = equation.split('=')
    
    # Normalize by bringing everything to one side of the equation
    # Reverse the signs on the right side
    right_side = right_side.replace('-', '+-')
    right_side = right_side.replace('+', '-')[1:] if right_side[0] != '-' else '+' + right_side[1:]
    
    # Combine the left and right sides
    normalized_eq = left_side + '+' + right_side
    
    # Replace '--' with '+' to simplify further processing
    normalized_eq = normalized_eq.replace('--', '+')
    
    # Split the equation into terms
    terms = normalized_eq.split('+')
    
    # Initialize coefficients for 'x' and the constant term
    x_coefficient, constant = 0, 0
    
    # Loop over each term to calculate the coefficients
    for term in terms:
        if 'x' in term:
            # If 'x' is present, it's either 'x' or 'nx' where n is a number
            num = term[:-1]
            x_coefficient += int(num) if num else 1
        elif term:
            # It's a constant term
            constant += int(term)
    
    return x_coefficient, constant

# Function to solve the equation
def solve_equation(x_coefficient, constant):
    if x_coefficient == 0 and constant == 0:
        return 'infinit'
    elif x_coefficient == 0:
        return 'imposibil'
    else:
        return f"{-constant / x_coefficient:.4f}"

# Open the input file and read the equations
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    # Read the number of equations
    num_equations = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Read each equation and solve it
    solutions = []
    for _ in range(num_equations):
        x_coefficient, constant = parse_equation(file.readline().strip())
        solutions.append(solve_equation(x_coefficient, constant))

# Write the solutions to the output file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(solution + '\n' for solution in solutions)
```

This script should now work as expected. It reads the input file, parses each equation to calculate the coefficients, solves the equations, and writes the solutions to the output file, correctly handling the sign reversal for the right-hand side terms.
