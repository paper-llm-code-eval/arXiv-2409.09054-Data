Să considerăm ecuaţii de gradul I, de forma: `expresie_1=expresie_2`. Expresiile specificate sunt constituite dintr-o succesiune de operanzi, între care există semnul `+` sau semnul `-` (cu semnificaţia binecunoscută de adunare, respectiv scădere). Fiecare operand este fie un număr natural, fie un număr natural urmat de litera `x` (litera `x` reprezentând necunoscuta), fie doar litera `x` (ceea ce este echivalent cu `1x`).

De exemplu: `2x-5+10x+4=20-x`. Observaţi că în ecuaţiile noastre nu apar paranteze şi necunoscuta este întotdeauna desemnată de litera mică `x`.

# Cerința

Scrieţi un program care să rezolve ecuaţii de gradul I, în formatul specificat în enunţul problemei.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ecuatii.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de ecuaţii din fişier. Pe fiecare dintre următoarele $n$ linii este scrisă câte o ecuaţie.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ecuatii.out` va conține $n$ linii, câte una pentru fiecare ecuaţie din fişierul de intrare. Pe linia $i$ va fi scrisă soluţia ecuaţiei de pe linia $i+1$ din fişierul de intrare.

Dacă soluţia ecuaţiei este un număr real, atunci acesta se va scrie cu 4 zecimale. Răspunsul este considerat corect dacă diferenţa în valoare absolută dintre soluţia corectă şi soluţia concurentului este < 0.001.

În cazul în care ecuaţia admite o infinitate de soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `infinit` (cu litere mici).

Dacă ecuaţia nu admite soluţii, se va scrie mesajul `imposibil` (de asemenea cu litere mici).

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 10$;
* Lungimea unei ecuaţii nu depăşeşte 255 caractere;
* Ecuaţiile nu conţin spaţii;
* Numerele naturale care intervin în ecuaţii sunt $\leq 1000$.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. However, looking at the problem statement and the solution, there is no need for `numpy` or any other external library as the solution uses only Python's standard library. 

The corrected solution without using `numpy` and with the correct parsing logic is as follows:

```python
import re

# Function to parse the equation and calculate the coefficients for x and the constant terms
def parse_equation(equation):
    # Regular expression to capture the coefficients and constants
    # Pattern will match parts like '2x', '-4', '+x', 'x', etc.
    pattern = re.compile(r'([+-]?\d*x?)')
    parts = pattern.findall(equation.replace('-', '+-'))  # Replace '-' with '+-' for easier split

    # Initialize coefficients and constants
    x_coeff = 0
    const = 0
    left_side = True  # Indicates if we are on the left side of the equation

    # Iterate over each part of the equation
    for part in parts:
        if part == '=':  # Switch to the right side of the equation
            left_side = False
            continue

        # Check if part contains the variable 'x'
        if 'x' in part:
            # Normalize part to ensure it has the format '+nx' or '-nx'
            if part == 'x' or part == '+x':
                part = '+1x'
            elif part == '-x':
                part = '-1x'

            coeff = int(part[:-1])
            if left_side:
                x_coeff += coeff
            else:
                x_coeff -= coeff
        else:
            value = int(part)
            if left_side:
                const -= value
            else:
                const += value

    return x_coeff, const

# Function to solve the equation after parsing
def solve_equation(coeffs):
    a, b = coeffs
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            return 'infinit'
        else:

with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    for equation in equations:
        coeffs = parse_equation(equation)
        result = solve_equation(coeffs)
        file.write(result + '\n')
```

This version doesn't import `numpy` and should work with Python's standard library, while also providing correct parsing and solving of the linear equations in the format specified.

The error message indicates that there is an attempt to convert an invalid literal, specifically `'+'`, into an integer, which is not possible. The problem lies in the regular expression pattern and the subsequent handling of the parts. We need to adjust the pattern to correctly match numbers and optionally the 'x' character, and handle signs properly.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import re

# Function to parse the equation and calculate the coefficients for x and the constant terms
def parse_equation(equation):
    # Regular expression to capture the coefficients and constants
    pattern = re.compile(r'([+-]?)(\d*)(x?)')
    left_x_coeff = 0
    left_const = 0
    right_x_coeff = 0
    right_const = 0
    left_side = True  # Indicates if we are on the left side of the equation

    for match in pattern.finditer(equation):
        sign, num, x = match.groups()
        # Determine the sign of the term
        sign = -1 if sign == '-' else 1
        # Convert num to integer if it's not empty, otherwise use 1 (for cases like 'x' or '+x')
        num = int(num) if num else 1
        if x:  # If the term contains 'x'
            if left_side:
                left_x_coeff += sign * num
            else:
                right_x_coeff += sign * num
        else:  # If the term is a constant
            if left_side:
                left_const += sign * num
            else:
                right_const += sign * num

        # Check if we've reached the right side of the equation
        if match.end() < len(equation) and equation[match.end()] == '=':
            left_side = False

    # Combine the coefficients and constants to form the simplified equation Ax + B = 0
    return left_x_coeff - right_x_coeff, right_const - left_const

# Function to solve the equation after parsing
def solve_equation(coeffs):
    a, b = coeffs
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            return 'infinit'
        else:
            return 'imposibil'
    else:
        return f'{-b / a:.4f}'

# Read equations from file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    equations = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Solve each equation and write the results to the file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    for equation in equations:
        coeffs = parse_equation(equation)
        result = solve_equation(coeffs)
        file.write(result + '\n')
```

This code should work correctly, as it properly captures numbers with their signs and the presence of 'x'. It also correctly distinguishes between the left and right sides of the equation when the '=' sign is encountered, and it calculates the coefficients for 'x' and the constants appropriately. The solution is then outputted with the required precision.

The results differ from the expected output due to a bug in the sign handling for the constant term in the `solve_equation` function. The sign of `b` should not be negated when calculating the solution. Additionally, the regular expression for parsing the coefficients of `x` did not account for the fact that the sign should be applied to the subsequent number or `x` term.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import re

# Function to parse the equation and calculate the coefficients for x and the constant terms
def parse_equation(equation):
    terms = re.split(r'(\+|-|=)', equation)  # Split by +, -, and =
    terms = [term for term in terms if term]  # Remove empty strings
    x_coeff = 0
    const = 0
    side = 1  # +1 for left side, -1 for right side

    for term in terms:
        if term == '=':
            side = -1  # Switch to right side
        elif term in '+-':
            sign = 1 if term == '+' else -1
        else:
            if 'x' in term:
                value = term.replace('x', '')
                value = sign * (int(value) if value else 1)
                x_coeff += value * side
            else:
                const += sign * int(term) * side
    
    return x_coeff, const

# Function to solve the equation after parsing
def solve_equation(coeffs):
    a, b = coeffs
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            return 'infinit'
        else:
            return 'imposibil'
    else:
        return f'{b / a:.4f}'

# Read equations from file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    equations = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Solve each equation and write the results to the file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    for equation in equations:
        coeffs = parse_equation(equation)
        result = solve_equation(coeffs)
        file.write(result + '\n')
```

This corrected solution splits the equation on '+', '-', and '=' to properly handle the sign for each term, and ensures the correct side of the equation is being processed. With this fix, the output should now match the expected results.

The issue is caused by the variable `sign` not being initialized before being used to multiply with the parsed `value`. We need to ensure that `sign` is properly initialized for each term in the equation. The code should initialize `sign` to +1 at the beginning of the loop and update it whenever a '+' or '-' sign is encountered.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import re

# Function to parse the equation and calculate the coefficients for x and the constant terms
def parse_equation(equation):
    # Split the equation into parts with signs and equal sign separated
    parts = re.split(r'([+-]|=)', equation)
    x_coeff = 0
    const = 0
    sign = 1  # Initial sign for the first term
    left_side = True  # Indicates if we are on the left side of the equation

    for part in parts:
        if part in '+-':
            sign = 1 if part == '+' else -1
        elif part == '=':
            left_side = False  # Switch sides when '=' is encountered
            sign = 1  # Reset sign for the right side
        elif 'x' in part:
            num = part[:-1] if part[:-1] else '1'
            if left_side:
                x_coeff += sign * int(num)
            else:
                x_coeff -= sign * int(num)
        elif part:
            # It's a constant number
            if left_side:
                const -= sign * int(part)
            else:
                const += sign * int(part)

    return x_coeff, const

# Function to solve the equation after parsing
def solve_equation(coeffs):
    a, b = coeffs
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            return 'infinit'
        else:
            return 'imposibil'
    else:
        return f'{b / a:.4f}'

# Read equations from file
with open('ecuatii.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    equations = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Solve each equation and write the results to the file
with open('ecuatii.out', 'w') as file:
    for equation in equations:
        coeffs = parse_equation(equation)
        result = solve_equation(coeffs)
        file.write(result + '\n')
```

This solution initializes `sign` at the start of the `for` loop and updates it whenever a '+' or '-' is encountered. When '=' is encountered, it switches sides and resets the `sign` to 1 for the right side of the equation. This should fix the `UnboundLocalError` and produce the correct results.
