Păcală a primit, aşa cum era învoiala, un petec de teren de pe moşia boierului. Terenul este împrejmuit complet cu segmente drepte de gard ce se sprijină la ambele capete de câte un par zdravăn. La o nouă prinsoare, Păcală iese iar in câştig şi primeşte dreptul să strămute nişte pari, unul câte unul, cum i-o fi voia, astfel încât să-şi extindă suprafaţa de teren. Dar învoiala prevede că fiecare par poate fi mutat în orice direcţie, dar nu pe o distanţă mai mare decât o valoare dată (scrisă pe fiecare par) şi fiecare segment de gard, fiind cam şubred, poate fi rotit şi prelungit de la un singur capăt, celălalt rămânând nemişcat.

Cunoscând poziţiile iniţiale ale parilor şi valoarea înscrisă pe fiecare par, se cere suprafaţa maximă cu care poate să-şi extindă Păcală proprietatea. Se ştie că parii sunt daţi într-o ordine oarecare, poziţiile lor iniţiale sunt date prin numere întregi de cel mult $3$ cifre, distanţele pe care fiecare par poate fi deplasat sunt numere naturale strict pozitive şi figura formată de terenul iniţial este un poligon neconcav,

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `mosia.in` conţine $n+1$ linii cu următoarele valori:
$n$				    – numărul de pari
$x_1  y_1  d_1$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $1$
$x_2  y_2  d_2$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $2$
...
$x_n  y_n  d_n$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $n$

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `mosia.out` se scrie un număr real cu $4$ zecimale ce reprezintă suprafaţa maximă cu care se poate mări moşia.

# Restricţii şi observaţii:
* $3 < N ≤ 200$ număr natural
* $–1 \ 000 < x_i,y_i < 1 \ 000$ numere întregi
* $0 < d_i ≤ 20$ numere întregi
* poligonul neconcav se defineşte ca un poligon convex cu unele vârfuri coliniare
* poziţiile parilor sunt date într-o ordine oarecare
* poligonul obţinut după mutarea parilor poate fi concav
* poziţiile finale ale parilor nu sunt in mod obligatoriu numere naturale

        x, y, d = map(int, line.strip().split())
        posts.append((x, y, d))
    return n, np.array(posts)

def calculate_area(points):
    # Calculate the area of a polygon given its corner points (x, y)

def move_post(post, d):

    x, y, d = post
    return np.array([x + d, y]), np.array([x - d, y]), np.array([x, y + d]), np.array([x, y - d])

def optimize_area(n, posts):

        original = posts[i, :2].copy()
        distances = posts[i, 2]
        for dx, dy in [(distances, 0), (-distances, 0), (0, distances), (0, -distances)]:

Please note that this code will not be executed in the current environment. To test the solution, you would need to create an input file named `mosia.in` with the appropriate format, run the code in an environment where you have file system access, and then check the `mosia.out` file for the output. This code assumes that the input data is well-formed and does not contain any error handling for malformed input.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in your environment. Since we have a strict memory limit and the task requires reading and writing from files without using `numpy` or any other external libraries that are not part of the standard Python distribution, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy`.

Here's a pure Python solution that reads from `mosia.in`, computes the maximum possible extension of the area, and writes to `mosia.out`:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        posts = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]
    return n, posts

def calculate_area(points):
    # Calculate the area using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    n = len(points)
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += points[i][0] * points[j][1]
        area -= points[i][1] * points[j][0]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def move_post(post, d):
    x, y, _ = post
    return [(x + d, y), (x - d, y), (x, y + d), (x, y - d)]

def optimize_area(n, posts):
    max_area = calculate_area([post[:2] for post in posts])
    for i in range(n):
        original = posts[i]
        distances = posts[i][2]
        for post in move_post(original, distances):
            temp_posts = posts[:i] + [post] + posts[i+1:]
            temp_area = calculate_area([p[:2] for p in temp_posts])
            max_area = max(max_area, temp_area)
    return max_area

def write_output(filename, max_area):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{max_area:.4f}\n")

# The main logic of the program
n, posts = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = optimize_area(n, posts)
write_output('mosia.out', max_area)
```

This code is now using only built-in Python libraries, adhering to the memory constraints given in the problem statement.

Please ensure that the input file `mosia.in` is formatted correctly and that the output file `mosia.out` is writable in your environment.

Again, please note that this code has to be executed in your local environment as the current environment does not provide access to the file system.

Upon reviewing the previous implementation, it seems there is an issue with how the area is being maximized when moving the posts. The naive approach simply moves each post in all four cardinal directions by the maximum distance allowed, but this does not necessarily maximize the area. To find the true maximum area, we must consider moving each post along the direction that would indeed maximize the area of the polygon.

The area of a polygon can be maximized by moving a vertex in the direction perpendicular to the line that connects its adjacent vertices, effectively pushing the side outwards. This requires calculating the direction in which to move each post, which is more complex than simply moving the posts in the cardinal directions.

Let's re-implement the solution with a correct approach.

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        posts = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]
    return n, posts

def calculate_area(points):
    area = 0
    n = len(points)
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += points[i][0] * points[j][1] - points[j][0] * points[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def move_post(post, prev_post, next_post, d):
    # Move the post to the location that maximizes the area.
    # Find the direction perpendicular to the line from prev_post to next_post.
    direction = (next_post[1] - prev_post[1], prev_post[0] - next_post[0])
    length = (direction[0]**2 + direction[1]**2)**0.5
    
    # Normalize the direction.
    if length == 0:
        return post
    direction = (direction[0] / length, direction[1] / length)
    
    # Move the post by distance d in the normalized direction.
    return (post[0] + direction[0] * d, post[1] + direction[1] * d)

def optimize_area(n, posts):
    max_area = calculate_area([post[:2] for post in posts])
    for i in range(n):
        d = posts[i][2]
        prev_post = posts[(i - 1 + n) % n][:2]
        next_post = posts[(i + 1) % n][:2]
        new_post = move_post(posts[i][:2], prev_post, next_post, d)
        
        # Replace the current post with the new post and calculate the new area.
        new_posts = posts[:i] + [(new_post[0], new_post[1], d)] + posts[i+1:]
        temp_area = calculate_area([p[:2] for p in new_posts])
        max_area = max(max_area, temp_area)
    return max_area

def write_output(filename, max_area):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{max_area:.4f}\n")

# The main logic of the program
n, posts = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = optimize_area(n, posts)
write_output('mosia.out', max_area)
```

This code should maximize the area correctly by moving each post outward perpendicular to the edge it's connected to. The `move_post` function has been updated to compute the direction that maximizes the area increase when the post is moved. Please run this updated solution in your local environment, as this environment does not support file operations.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output seems to be due to an incorrect assumption in the algorithm used to move the posts. The corrected algorithm should consider the following:

- Each post can be moved by its distance in any direction, not just along the perpendicular bisector of the line formed by its adjacent vertices. This means we should check all possible positions the post can be moved to within the distance `d`.

Let's fix the solution by checking all possible positions within the circle of radius `d` around each post:

```python
from math import cos, sin, pi

def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        posts = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]
    return n, posts

def calculate_area(points):
    area = 0
    n = len(points)
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += points[i][0] * points[j][1] - points[j][0] * points[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def optimize_area(n, posts):
    max_area = calculate_area([post[:2] for post in posts])
    for i in range(n):
        x, y, d = posts[i]
        # Check positions around the post within distance d
        for angle in range(0, 360):
            radians = pi * angle / 180.0
            new_x = x + d * cos(radians)
            new_y = y + d * sin(radians)
            new_posts = posts[:i] + [(new_x, new_y, d)] + posts[i+1:]
            temp_area = calculate_area([p[:2] for p in new_posts])
            max_area = max(max_area, temp_area)
    return max_area

def write_output(filename, max_area):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{max_area:.4f}\n")

# The main logic of the program
n, posts = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = optimize_area(n, posts)
write_output('mosia.out', max_area)
```

In this corrected solution, we loop over all possible angles from 0 to 359 degrees to consider all potential positions to which a post could be moved within its allowed distance. The area is recalculated for each new configuration and the maximum area is updated accordingly.

Please note that this approach might not be the most efficient in terms of computation time, as it checks multiple positions for each post, but it should find the correct maximum area. If performance is an issue, further optimizations can be applied, such as checking fewer positions or using a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the best direction to move each post.

Please run this updated solution in your local environment.
