Păcală a primit, aşa cum era învoiala, un petec de teren de pe moşia boierului. Terenul este împrejmuit complet cu segmente drepte de gard ce se sprijină la ambele capete de câte un par zdravăn. La o nouă prinsoare, Păcală iese iar in câştig şi primeşte dreptul să strămute nişte pari, unul câte unul, cum i-o fi voia, astfel încât să-şi extindă suprafaţa de teren. Dar învoiala prevede că fiecare par poate fi mutat în orice direcţie, dar nu pe o distanţă mai mare decât o valoare dată (scrisă pe fiecare par) şi fiecare segment de gard, fiind cam şubred, poate fi rotit şi prelungit de la un singur capăt, celălalt rămânând nemişcat.

Cunoscând poziţiile iniţiale ale parilor şi valoarea înscrisă pe fiecare par, se cere suprafaţa maximă cu care poate să-şi extindă Păcală proprietatea. Se ştie că parii sunt daţi într-o ordine oarecare, poziţiile lor iniţiale sunt date prin numere întregi de cel mult $3$ cifre, distanţele pe care fiecare par poate fi deplasat sunt numere naturale strict pozitive şi figura formată de terenul iniţial este un poligon neconcav,

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `mosia.in` conţine $n+1$ linii cu următoarele valori:
$n$				    – numărul de pari
$x_1  y_1  d_1$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $1$
$x_2  y_2  d_2$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $2$
...
$x_n  y_n  d_n$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $n$

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `mosia.out` se scrie un număr real cu $4$ zecimale ce reprezintă suprafaţa maximă cu care se poate mări moşia.

# Restricţii şi observaţii:
* $3 < N ≤ 200$ număr natural
* $–1 \ 000 < x_i,y_i < 1 \ 000$ numere întregi
* $0 < d_i ≤ 20$ numere întregi
* poligonul neconcav se defineşte ca un poligon convex cu unele vârfuri coliniare
* poziţiile parilor sunt date într-o ordine oarecare
* poligonul obţinut după mutarea parilor poate fi concav
* poziţiile finale ale parilor nu sunt in mod obligatoriu numere naturale

    write_output('mosia.out', max_area)

Please note that due to the memory constraint, using NumPy might be avoided if necessary, and we could simply use Python's built-in product function from itertools. However, the code above uses NumPy's `product` function for brevity. The product function is assumed to be a placeholder for whatever method used to create the Cartesian product of all possible post positions.

The error message suggests that the `numpy` module is not installed or not available in the execution environment. It's possible that the challenge expects the solution to work without relying on any external libraries such as `numpy` to ensure the memory constraints are met.

Given that, I'll rewrite the solution without using `numpy` and instead utilize Python's standard library, particularly the `itertools.product` function to generate the Cartesian product of all possible post positions.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
import itertools

def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        n = int(f.readline().strip())
        coords_distances = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in f]
    return n, coords_distances

def move_post(x, y, d):
    return [(x+d, y), (x, y+d)]

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1]
        area -= vertices[i][1] * vertices[j][0]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(n, coords_distances):
    all_positions = [move_post(x, y, d) for x, y, d in coords_distances]
    max_area = 0
    for combination in itertools.product(*all_positions):
        # Flattening the list of tuples into a single list of vertices
        vertices = [vertex for position in combination for vertex in position]
        area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
    return max_area

def write_output(file_path, max_area):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{max_area:.4f}\n")

def main():
    n, coords_distances = read_input('mosia.in')
    max_area = maximize_area(n, coords_distances)
    write_output('mosia.out', max_area)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code should satisfy the constraints and is optimized to use minimal memory by avoiding external libraries and heavy data structures. Please ensure that your execution environment has the appropriate permissions and the input file `mosia.in` is in the correct directory from where the script is executed.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `shoelace_formula` function: an 'int' object is not subscriptable. This suggests that the `vertices` list is not structured correctly when passed to the `shoelace_formula` function. It seems that I mistakenly attempted to flatten the list of tuples into a single list of vertices in the `maximize_area` function, which caused the wrong data structure to be sent to the `shoelace_formula`.

I will correct the mistake by ensuring that `vertices` is a list of tuples, each tuple representing a vertex of the polygon.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import itertools

def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        n = int(f.readline().strip())
        coords_distances = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in f]
    return n, coords_distances

def move_post(x, y, d):
    return [(x+d, y), (x, y+d)]

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1]
        area -= vertices[i][1] * vertices[j][0]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(n, coords_distances):
    all_positions = [move_post(x, y, d) for x, y, d in coords_distances]
    max_area = 0
    for combination in itertools.product(*all_positions):
        area = shoelace_formula(combination)
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
    return max_area

def write_output(file_path, max_area):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{max_area:.4f}\n")

def main():
    n, coords_distances = read_input('mosia.in')
    max_area = maximize_area(n, coords_distances)
    write_output('mosia.out', max_area)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This corrected code should now correctly pass the vertices as a list of tuples to the `shoelace_formula` function and calculate the maximum area without encountering the `TypeError`. Ensure again that the input file `mosia.in` is properly placed in the directory from where the script is running.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests that the algorithm is not correctly maximizing the area of the polygon formed by moving the posts. The initial implementation only considers moving each post up or to the right by its maximum allowed distance, which does not guarantee maximizing the area of the resulting polygon.

To ensure that we maximize the area, we need to consider all combinations of moving each post to any point within its maximum distance. For each post, we have a circle of radius equal to the maximum distance the post can be moved. The new position of the post should lie on the boundary of this circle to maximize the area.

Here is the revised solution, using a more appropriate approach that considers all boundary points for each post:

```python
import itertools
import math

def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        n = int(f.readline().strip())
        coords_distances = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in f]
    return n, coords_distances

def generate_boundary_points(x, y, d):
    # Generate a set of boundary points for the circle with radius d around (x, y)
    points = []
    # We'll approximate the circle by using a set number of points on its boundary
    num_points = 100  # Increase for higher precision
    for i in range(num_points):
        angle = 2 * math.pi * i / num_points
        new_x = x + d * math.cos(angle)
        new_y = y + d * math.sin(angle)
        points.append((new_x, new_y))
    return points

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1]
        area -= vertices[i][1] * vertices[j][0]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(n, coords_distances):
    all_positions = [generate_boundary_points(x, y, d) for x, y, d in coords_distances]
    max_area = 0
    # Generate all possible polygons by taking one boundary point per post
    for combination in itertools.product(*all_positions):
        area = shoelace_formula(combination)
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
    return max_area

def write_output(file_path, max_area):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{max_area:.4f}\n")

def main():
    n, coords_distances = read_input('mosia.in')
    max_area = maximize_area(n, coords_distances)
    write_output('mosia.out', max_area)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution approximates the boundary of the circle for each post by generating a fixed number of points around the circle. By increasing the number of points, we can get a better approximation, at the cost of increased computation time and memory usage. However, we must also ensure we stay within the memory limit of ~8MB. If the program still exceeds memory usage or does not provide the correct answer, further optimizations or a different approach will be needed.
