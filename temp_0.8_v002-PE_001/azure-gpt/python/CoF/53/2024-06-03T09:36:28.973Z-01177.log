Păcală a primit, aşa cum era învoiala, un petec de teren de pe moşia boierului. Terenul este împrejmuit complet cu segmente drepte de gard ce se sprijină la ambele capete de câte un par zdravăn. La o nouă prinsoare, Păcală iese iar in câştig şi primeşte dreptul să strămute nişte pari, unul câte unul, cum i-o fi voia, astfel încât să-şi extindă suprafaţa de teren. Dar învoiala prevede că fiecare par poate fi mutat în orice direcţie, dar nu pe o distanţă mai mare decât o valoare dată (scrisă pe fiecare par) şi fiecare segment de gard, fiind cam şubred, poate fi rotit şi prelungit de la un singur capăt, celălalt rămânând nemişcat.

Cunoscând poziţiile iniţiale ale parilor şi valoarea înscrisă pe fiecare par, se cere suprafaţa maximă cu care poate să-şi extindă Păcală proprietatea. Se ştie că parii sunt daţi într-o ordine oarecare, poziţiile lor iniţiale sunt date prin numere întregi de cel mult $3$ cifre, distanţele pe care fiecare par poate fi deplasat sunt numere naturale strict pozitive şi figura formată de terenul iniţial este un poligon neconcav,

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `mosia.in` conţine $n+1$ linii cu următoarele valori:
$n$				    – numărul de pari
$x_1  y_1  d_1$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $1$
$x_2  y_2  d_2$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $2$
...
$x_n  y_n  d_n$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $n$

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `mosia.out` se scrie un număr real cu $4$ zecimale ce reprezintă suprafaţa maximă cu care se poate mări moşia.

# Restricţii şi observaţii:
* $3 < N ≤ 200$ număr natural
* $–1 \ 000 < x_i,y_i < 1 \ 000$ numere întregi
* $0 < d_i ≤ 20$ numere întregi
* poligonul neconcav se defineşte ca un poligon convex cu unele vârfuri coliniare
* poziţiile parilor sunt date într-o ordine oarecare
* poligonul obţinut după mutarea parilor poate fi concav
* poziţiile finale ale parilor nu sunt in mod obligatoriu numere naturale

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    n = int(lines[0])
    stakes = np.zeros((n, 3), dtype=int)
    for i in range(n):
        x, y, d = map(int, lines[i + 1].split())
        stakes[i] = [x, y, d]
    return stakes

def cross_product(p1, p2, p3):
    return (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])

def calculate_area(stakes):
    n = len(stakes)
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += stakes[i][0] * stakes[j][1]
        area -= stakes[j][0] * stakes[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(stakes):
    stakes = np.array(sorted(stakes, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])))
    lower_hull = []
    upper_hull = []

    for stake in stakes:
        while len(lower_hull) >= 2 and cross_product(lower_hull[-2], lower_hull[-1], stake) <= 0:
            lower_hull.pop()
        lower_hull.append(stake)

    for stake in stakes[::-1]:
        while len(upper_hull) >= 2 and cross_product(upper_hull[-2], upper_hull[-1], stake) <= 0:
            upper_hull.pop()
        upper_hull.append(stake)
    
    convex_hull = np.array(lower_hull[:-1] + upper_hull[:-1])

    original_area = calculate_area(convex_hull[:, :2])
    max_area = original_area

    for i, stake in enumerate(convex_hull):
        max_move = stake[2]
        prev_point = convex_hull[i - 1][:2]
        next_point = convex_hull[(i + 1) % len(convex_hull)][:2]
        direction = np.array(next_point) - np.array(prev_point)
        direction = direction / np.linalg.norm(direction) * max_move
        new_point = stake[:2] + direction
        convex_hull[i][:2] = new_point
        area = calculate_area(convex_hull[:, :2])
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
        convex_hull[i][:2] = stake[:2]  # Reset to original after checking

    return max_area

stakes = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = maximize_area(stakes)
with open('mosia.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_area:.4f}\n')
```

This code should read the input file `mosia.in`, calculate the maximum area by moving the stakes according to the rules, and write the result to the output file `mosia.out`. Note that this code is just an initial attempt and might require further optimization to fit within the memory constraint.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which suggests that `numpy` is not installed in the environment where the program is being executed, or that the environment doesn't support third-party modules like `numpy`.

Given the constraints of the problem, including the memory limit and the error message, we need to write a solution that does not rely on `numpy` or any other third-party library. I will now rewrite the solution using only the standard Python library to handle the calculations.

Here's the rewritten solution:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    n = int(lines[0])
    stakes = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    return stakes

def cross_product(o, a, b):
    return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])

def calculate_area(stakes):
    n = len(stakes)
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += stakes[i][0] * stakes[j][1]
        area -= stakes[j][0] * stakes[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(stakes):
    stakes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
    original_area = calculate_area([s[:2] for s in stakes])
    max_area = original_area

    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        par = stakes[i]
        dist = par[2]
        
        # Only consider the edge cases (max distance in any direction)
        for dx in [-dist, dist]:
            for dy in [-dist, dist]:
                new_x, new_y = par[0] + dx, par[1] + dy
                tmp_x, tmp_y = stakes[i][0], stakes[i][1]
                stakes[i][0], stakes[i][1] = new_x, new_y

                potential_area = calculate_area([s[:2] for s in stakes])
                if potential_area > max_area:
                    max_area = potential_area

                stakes[i][0], stakes[i][1] = tmp_x, tmp_y

    return max_area

# Read input, calculate the maximum area, and write output.
stakes = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = maximize_area(stakes)
with open('mosia.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_area:.4f}\n')
```

This solution reads the input file, calculates the area, and writes the output without using any external libraries. It utilizes the standard Python sort method and simple arithmetic to achieve the desired result. The `calculate_area` function computes the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula. The `maximize_area` function tries moving each stake to each corner of its allowed distance box and checks if this move increases the area. This solution should meet the memory constraints provided.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found output indicates that the solution is not correctly maximizing the area of the polygon. The earlier solution attempted to move each stake to the corners of its allowed distance box, but this method does not guarantee finding the optimal positions for the stakes that result in the maximum area. We must consider moving the stakes along the vectors that are normal to each edge of the polygon since this is the direction that will maximize the area gain for each edge.

Let's reimplement the solution with consideration for the fact that each edge can be extended in the direction normal to the edge by the amount specified for each stake:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    n = int(lines[0])
    stakes = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    return stakes

def calculate_area(stakes):
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(stakes)
        area += stakes[i][0] * stakes[j][1] - stakes[j][0] * stakes[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def normalize(vector):
    norm = (vector[0]**2 + vector[1]**2)**0.5
    return (vector[0] / norm, vector[1] / norm)

def find_normal_vector(a, b):
    edge = (b[0] - a[0], b[1] - a[1])
    normal = (-edge[1], edge[0])
    return normalize(normal)

def move_stake(stake, direction, distance):
    return (stake[0] + direction[0] * distance, stake[1] + direction[1] * distance)

stakes = read_input('mosia.in')

# Move each stake to its possible furthest position along the normal vector of each edge.
for i, (x, y, d) in enumerate(stakes):
    prev_stake = stakes[i - 1] if i > 0 else stakes[-1]
    next_stake = stakes[i + 1] if i < len(stakes) - 1 else stakes[0]

    # Find normals for both adjacent edges
    normal_prev = find_normal_vector(prev_stake, (x, y))
    normal_next = find_normal_vector((x, y), next_stake)

    # Move the stake along the bisector of the normals
    bisector = normalize((normal_prev[0] + normal_next[0], normal_prev[1] + normal_next[1]))
    stakes[i] = move_stake(stakes[i], bisector, d)

max_area = calculate_area([(x, y) for x, y, _ in stakes])

# Write the result to the output file.
with open('mosia.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_area:.4f}\n')
```

In this solution, each stake is moved in the direction that bisects the normals to the adjacent edges. This direction maximizes the area that can be added by moving the stake. The `find_normal_vector` function calculates the normal vector to an edge (in a counterclockwise direction), and the `move_stake` function moves the stake in a given direction by a specified distance. Finally, we calculate the area of the new polygon and write the result to the output file `mosia.out`. This approach should give us the correct maximum area.

The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in tuple unpacking while trying to calculate the area. The code is expecting a tuple with three elements, but it's only getting two. This happens because the stakes list was modified to only contain tuples with two elements (x, y) instead of three (x, y, d).

Let's fix the issue by not overriding the stakes list and instead using a separate list to store the updated coordinates. Additionally, in the previous code, there is an assumption that moving the stake along the bisector of the normals will always maximize the area, which might not be true, especially if the initial polygon is not convex. We should actually calculate the potential position by moving the stake in the direction normal to its corresponding edge and then decide which direction gives the maximum increase in the area.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    n = int(lines[0])
    stakes = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    return stakes

def calculate_area(stakes):
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(stakes)
        area += stakes[i][0] * stakes[j][1] - stakes[j][0] * stakes[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def find_normal_vector(a, b):
    edge_vector = (b[0] - a[0], b[1] - a[1])
    normal_vector = (-edge_vector[1], edge_vector[0])
    length = (normal_vector[0] ** 2 + normal_vector[1] ** 2) ** 0.5
    return (normal_vector[0] / length, normal_vector[1] / length)

def maximize_area(stakes):
    original_area = calculate_area([stake[:2] for stake in stakes])
    max_area = original_area
    new_stakes = stakes[:]

    for i, stake in enumerate(stakes):
        # Calculate the normal vector of the preceding edge
        prev = stakes[i - 1]
        prev_normal = find_normal_vector(prev[:2], stake[:2])

        # Calculate the normal vector of the following edge
        next = stakes[(i + 1) % len(stakes)]
        next_normal = find_normal_vector(stake[:2], next[:2])

        # Calculate potential new positions by moving the stake along the normals
        for normal in [prev_normal, next_normal]:
            new_x = stake[0] + normal[0] * stake[2]
            new_y = stake[1] + normal[1] * stake[2]
            new_stakes[i] = (new_x, new_y)

            # Calculate the area of the polygon with the stake moved
            new_area = calculate_area([s[:2] for s in new_stakes])
            if new_area > max_area:
                max_area = new_area

            # Reset the stake position
            new_stakes[i] = stake

    return max_area

stakes = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = maximize_area(stakes)

with open('mosia.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_area:.4f}\n')
```

This corrected solution keeps the original stakes list intact and uses a new list called `new_stakes` for the temporary updated coordinates. For each stake, we calculate the normal vectors for the two edges it belongs to and consider two potential new positions by moving the stake along each normal vector. We then calculate the area for each potential position and keep track of the maximum area found. Finally, we write the maximum area to the output file `mosia.out`. This approach ensures that we don't lose the distance information (`d`) for each stake and correctly calculates the area after each potential move.

The discrepancy between the expected result and the found result indicates that the solution is still not correctly finding the optimal stake positions to maximize the area. The issue lies in the way we are moving the stakes. In the previous attempt, we tried moving stakes along the normals of the adjacent edges, which may not always produce the maximum area. We should consider that each stake can be moved within a circle defined by its distance, and we need to find the optimal point on this circle that maximizes the area of the polygon.

To correct the implementation, we can approach the problem as follows:
- For each stake, compute the circle center based on its current position and the distance it can be moved.
- For each edge of the polygon, find the optimal point on the circle that maximizes the area when the stake at one end of the edge is moved.

Here's how we can implement the revised solution:

```python
import math

def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    n = int(lines[0])
    stakes = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    return stakes

def calculate_area(stakes):
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(stakes)
        area += stakes[i][0] * stakes[j][1] - stakes[j][0] * stakes[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(stakes):
    original_area = calculate_area([stake[:2] for stake in stakes])
    max_area = original_area

    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        # Current stake and its distance
        x, y, d = stakes[i]

        # Calculate the angles of vectors from the current stake to its neighbors
        prev_stake = stakes[i - 1]
        next_stake = stakes[(i + 1) % len(stakes)]
        angle_prev = math.atan2(prev_stake[1] - y, prev_stake[0] - x)
        angle_next = math.atan2(next_stake[1] - y, next_stake[0] - x)

        # Calculate angle delta for sampling points on the circle
        angle_delta = math.pi / 180  # 1 degree in radians

        # Sample points on the circle and calculate the area
        for angle in np.arange(angle_prev, angle_next, angle_delta):
            new_x = x + d * math.cos(angle)
            new_y = y + d * math.sin(angle)
            new_stakes = stakes[:]
            new_stakes[i] = [new_x, new_y, d]

            new_area = calculate_area([s[:2] for s in new_stakes])
            max_area = max(max_area, new_area)

    return max_area

stakes = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = maximize_area(stakes)

with open('mosia.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_area:.4f}\n')
```

In this solution, we sample points on the circle defined by each stake's distance. We then compute the area of the polygon resulting from moving the stake to each sampled point and update the maximum area accordingly.

Please note that the above code includes the `numpy` library only for the `np.arange()` function, which can be replaced with a Python built-in range function if `numpy` cannot be used. We're also using `math.atan2()` to calculate angles and `math.cos()` and `math.sin()` to compute the coordinates of the sampled points on the circle.

However, since `numpy` was not allowed as per the instructions, here is the modified part without using `numpy`:

```python
        # Sample points on the circle and calculate the area
        angle = angle_prev
        while angle < angle_next:
            new_x = x + d * math.cos(angle)
            new_y = y + d * math.sin(angle)
            new_stakes = stakes[:]
            new_stakes[i] = [new_x, new_y, d]

            new_area = calculate_area([s[:2] for s in new_stakes])
            max_area = max(max_area, new_area)
            
            angle += angle_delta
```

This should ensure a solution that complies with the constraints and achieves the correct result.

The error comes from the fact that we are trying to use `np.arange()`, which is a function from the `numpy` library that I mistakenly left in the solution despite stating that we should remove it to comply with the constraints of not using third-party libraries. Let's eliminate the use of `numpy` and rewrite the part of the code that samples points on the circle using a standard Python `while` loop.

Here is the corrected solution without using any third-party libraries:

```python

def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    n = int(lines[0])
    stakes = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    return stakes

def calculate_area(stakes):
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(stakes)
        area += stakes[i][0] * stakes[j][1] - stakes[j][0] * stakes[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(stakes):
    original_area = calculate_area([stake[:2] for stake in stakes])
    max_area = original_area

    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        # Current stake and its distance
        x, y, d = stakes[i]

        # Calculate the angles of vectors from the current stake to its neighbors
        prev_stake = stakes[i - 1]
        next_stake = stakes[(i + 1) % len(stakes)]
        angle_prev = math.atan2(prev_stake[1] - y, prev_stake[0] - x)
        angle_next = math.atan2(next_stake[1] - y, next_stake[0] - x)

        # Make sure angle_next is greater than angle_prev

This solution should work correctly, sampling points at 1-degree intervals around the circle that defines each stake's movement range, incrementing the angle using a while loop, and updating the maximum area. It should also strictly conform to the constraints by not using any third-party libraries.

The issue with the previous solution is that we're not correctly finding the optimal new position for each stake to maximize the area of the polygon. Sampling points on a circle at 1-degree intervals is a brute-force approach and does not guarantee finding the optimal solution, especially if the optimal point does not fall exactly on one of the sampled angles.

The correct approach is to move each stake to the furthest position possible along the line that is perpendicular to the edge of the polygon that the stake is a part of. This will ensure that the side length of the polygon is maximized in the direction where it can increase the area the most. 

Given that the input polygons are not necessarily convex, we need to handle the case where the optimal position for a stake is not along the normal to its adjacent edges. The most efficient way to handle this is to consider the contribution of each stake to the polygon's area individually. This means for each stake, we need to find the furthest position it can be moved to increase the area of the polygon formed by the remaining stakes (excluding the one being considered).

Let's implement this new approach:

```python
import math

def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    n = int(lines[0])
    stakes = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]]
    return stakes

def calculate_area(stakes):
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(stakes)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(stakes)
        area += stakes[i][0] * stakes[j][1] - stakes[j][0] * stakes[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def maximize_area(stakes):
    max_area = calculate_area([stake[:2] for stake in stakes])
    for i, (x, y, d) in enumerate(stakes):
        prev_stake = stakes[i - 1][:2] if i > 0 else stakes[-1][:2]
        next_stake = stakes[(i + 1) % len(stakes)][:2]
        
        # Calculate the direction vector of the edge and its normal
        edge_vector = (next_stake[0] - prev_stake[0], next_stake[1] - prev_stake[1])
        edge_length = math.hypot(edge_vector[0], edge_vector[1])
        normal = (-edge_vector[1] / edge_length, edge_vector[0] / edge_length)
        
        # Calculate the stake's furthest positions along the normal
        new_positions = [
            (x + normal[0] * d, y + normal[1] * d),
            (x - normal[0] * d, y - normal[1] * d)
        ]
        
        for new_pos in new_positions:
            new_stakes = list(stakes)
            new_stakes[i] = new_pos + (d,)
            new_area = calculate_area([s[:2] for s in new_stakes])
            max_area = max(max_area, new_area)
        
    return max_area

stakes = read_input('mosia.in')
max_area = maximize_area(stakes)

with open('mosia.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{max_area:.4f}\n')
```

In this solution, for each stake, we determine the edge to which the stake is connected. We then calculate the normal to that edge and move the stake along this normal in both directions to the maximum distance it can be moved. We calculate the area for both potential new positions and update the maximum area accordingly. This solution ensures that each stake is being utilized to its full potential in terms of increasing the polygon's area. 

This approach is a significant improvement over the previous sampling-based method and should provide the correct maximum area for the given input.
