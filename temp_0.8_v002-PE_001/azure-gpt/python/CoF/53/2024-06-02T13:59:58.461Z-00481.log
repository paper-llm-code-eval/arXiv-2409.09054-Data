Păcală a primit, aşa cum era învoiala, un petec de teren de pe moşia boierului. Terenul este împrejmuit complet cu segmente drepte de gard ce se sprijină la ambele capete de câte un par zdravăn. La o nouă prinsoare, Păcală iese iar in câştig şi primeşte dreptul să strămute nişte pari, unul câte unul, cum i-o fi voia, astfel încât să-şi extindă suprafaţa de teren. Dar învoiala prevede că fiecare par poate fi mutat în orice direcţie, dar nu pe o distanţă mai mare decât o valoare dată (scrisă pe fiecare par) şi fiecare segment de gard, fiind cam şubred, poate fi rotit şi prelungit de la un singur capăt, celălalt rămânând nemişcat.

Cunoscând poziţiile iniţiale ale parilor şi valoarea înscrisă pe fiecare par, se cere suprafaţa maximă cu care poate să-şi extindă Păcală proprietatea. Se ştie că parii sunt daţi într-o ordine oarecare, poziţiile lor iniţiale sunt date prin numere întregi de cel mult $3$ cifre, distanţele pe care fiecare par poate fi deplasat sunt numere naturale strict pozitive şi figura formată de terenul iniţial este un poligon neconcav,

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `mosia.in` conţine $n+1$ linii cu următoarele valori:
$n$				    – numărul de pari
$x_1  y_1  d_1$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $1$
$x_2  y_2  d_2$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $2$
...
$x_n  y_n  d_n$		– coordonatele iniţiale şi distanţa pe care poate fi mutat parul $n$

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `mosia.out` se scrie un număr real cu $4$ zecimale ce reprezintă suprafaţa maximă cu care se poate mări moşia.

# Restricţii şi observaţii:
* $3 < N ≤ 200$ număr natural
* $–1 \ 000 < x_i,y_i < 1 \ 000$ numere întregi
* $0 < d_i ≤ 20$ numere întregi
* poligonul neconcav se defineşte ca un poligon convex cu unele vârfuri coliniare
* poziţiile parilor sunt date într-o ordine oarecare
* poligonul obţinut după mutarea parilor poate fi concav
* poziţiile finale ale parilor nu sunt in mod obligatoriu numere naturale

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here is the Python solution according to the requirements. It's an efficient algorithm that uses the numpy library for numerical calculations. The code reads the input from 'mosia.in', computes the maximum area increase, and writes the result to 'mosia.out'.

```python
import numpy as np

# Function to compute the area of a polygon given by a list of points
def polygon_area(points):
    x = points[:, 0]
    y = points[:, 1]
    return 0.5 * np.abs(np.dot(x, np.roll(y, 1)) - np.dot(y, np.roll(x, 1)))

# Read input
with open('mosia.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    data = np.array([list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)])

# Extract initial positions and distances
positions = data[:, :2]
distances = data[:, 2]

# Initialize array for maximum positions after moving the poles
max_positions = np.copy(positions)

# For each pole, find the most distant point it can be moved to in the direction
# that maximizes the area of the polygon. This is always along the line of one
# of the adjacent sides.
for i in range(n):
    p = positions[i]
    d = distances[i]

    # Previous and next point indices
    prev_idx = (i - 1) % n
    next_idx = (i + 1) % n

    # Vectors for the sides adjacent to the current point
    prev_vector = positions[prev_idx] - p
    next_vector = positions[next_idx] - p

    # Normalize the vectors to unit length
    prev_unit = prev_vector / np.linalg.norm(prev_vector)
    next_unit = next_vector / np.linalg.norm(next_vector)

    # The most distant point can be along the bisector of the angle between the two sides
    bisector = prev_unit + next_unit
    bisector /= np.linalg.norm(bisector)

    # Move the pole along the bisector by the allowed distance
    max_positions[i] = p + bisector * d

# Compute the initial area of the polygon
initial_area = polygon_area(positions)

# Compute the maximum area of the polygon after moving the poles
max_area = polygon_area(max_positions)

# Compute the area difference
area_difference = max_area - initial_area

# Write output
with open('mosia.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{area_difference:.4f}\n')
```

This solution assumes that moving each pole along the bisector of the angle between its adjacent sides results in the maximum area. However, for more complex polygons, this might not always be true. The solution above provides a good approximation for convex or near-convex polygons but may not provide the absolute maximum area for highly concave or irregular shapes. Adjustments might be necessary for a more accurate solution in such cases.

The error you are encountering indicates that the numpy module is not installed in your Python environment. Since using numpy would be ideal for performance, you would typically install it via the package manager pip. However, considering the constraints of this challenge, we need to write a solution that does not rely on third-party libraries like numpy.

Here is a pure Python solution that should fit the memory constraints and not rely on numpy:

```python
# Function to compute the area of a polygon given by a list of points
def polygon_area(points):
    area = 0
    n = len(points)
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += points[i][0] * points[j][1] - points[j][0] * points[i][1]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

# Function to normalize a vector
def normalize(v):
    norm = (v[0]**2 + v[1]**2)**0.5
    return (v[0] / norm, v[1] / norm)

# Function to find the most distant point a pole can be moved to
def distant_point(p, d, prev_p, next_p):
    prev_vector = (prev_p[0] - p[0], prev_p[1] - p[1])
    next_vector = (next_p[0] - p[0], next_p[1] - p[1])
    prev_unit = normalize(prev_vector)
    next_unit = normalize(next_vector)
    bisector = (prev_unit[0] + next_unit[0], prev_unit[1] + next_unit[1])
    bisector_norm = normalize(bisector)
    return (p[0] + bisector_norm[0] * d, p[1] + bisector_norm[1] * d)

# Read input
with open('mosia.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    poles = [tuple(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize list for maximum positions after moving the poles
max_positions = [None] * n

# For each pole, find the most distant point it can be moved to along the bisector
for i in range(n):
    p = poles[i][:2]
    d = poles[i][2]
    prev_idx = (i - 1) % n
    next_idx = (i + 1) % n
    max_positions[i] = distant_point(p, d, poles[prev_idx][:2], poles[next_idx][:2])

# Compute the initial area of the polygon
initial_area = polygon_area([p[:2] for p in poles])

# Compute the maximum area of the polygon after moving the poles
max_area = polygon_area(max_positions)

# Compute the area difference
area_difference = max_area - initial_area

# Write output
with open('mosia.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{area_difference:.4f}\n')
```

This code defines functions that replace the functionality provided by numpy, such as area computation and vector normalization. It then proceeds as before to calculate the maximum area after moving the poles, and write the answer to 'mosia.out'.

The previous program is incorrectly computing the new positions of the poles. It tries to move each pole along the bisector of its adjacent sides, which may not always lead to an increase in the area of the polygon. Instead, we need to consider the movement in a direction that is perpendicular to the side extending from that pole to ensure an increase in area.

I will revise the algorithm to take into account that each pole can be moved in any direction but within a limited distance (d_i). For each pole, we have to find a new position that maximizes the area. Since the solution space is bounded and discrete (distances are integer values), we can attempt to move the pole in various directions and compute the area for each possible new position, keeping the one that results in the largest area.

Let's revise the code to implement this approach:

```python
# Function to compute the area of a polygon given by a list of points
def polygon_area(points):
    area = 0.0
    n = len(points)
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += points[i][0] * points[j][1]
        area -= points[i][1] * points[j][0]
    return abs(area) / 2.0

# Euclidean distance between two points
def distance(p1, p2):
    return ((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)**0.5

# Read input
with open('mosia.in', 'r') as infile:
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    poles = [tuple(map(int, infile.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the initial area
initial_area = polygon_area([pole[:2] for pole in poles])

# Try moving each pole within its allowed distance and calculate the area
max_area = initial_area
for i in range(n):
    x, y, d = poles[i]
    for dx in range(-d, d + 1):
        for dy in range(-d, d + 1):
            # If the movement is within the pole's distance limit
            if dx**2 + dy**2 <= d**2:
                new_pole = (x + dx, y + dy)
                new_poles = poles[:i] + [new_pole + (d,)] + poles[i+1:]
                new_area = polygon_area([pole[:2] for pole in new_poles])
                max_area = max(max_area, new_area)

# The area increase is the difference between the maximum and initial areas
area_increase = max_area - initial_area

# Write output
with open('mosia.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{area_increase:.4f}\n')
```

This code iterates through each pole, tests all potential new positions within the allowed distance, and calculates the area of the resulting polygon. The new position that results in the largest area is used to determine the maximum possible area increase. The result is then written to 'mosia.out', formatted to four decimal places as required.
