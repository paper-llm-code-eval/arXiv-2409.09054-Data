_Cif-Oji6_ este o imprimantă matriceală numită și imprimantă cu ace, deoarece tipărirea se realizează prin impactul acelor capului de imprimare pe o bandă cu tuș. Acele sunt aranjate într-o grilă dreptunghiulară formată din $5$ rânduri de ace, pe fiecare rând aflându-se la distanțe egale câte $3$ ace, așa cum se observă în figura următoare.

~[imprimanta-1.png]

Prin acționarea diferitelor combinații de ace din grilă, se definește forma fiecărei cifre ce permite tipărirea acesteia prin puncte, în felul următor:

~[imprimanta-2.png]

De exemplu, cifra $2$ va fi tipărită prin $11$ puncte ca rezultat al acționării a $11$ ace din grilă: din primul rând de ace al grilei se vor acționa toate cele $3$ ace, din următorul rând doar acul din dreapta, apoi de pe următorul rând toate cele $3$ ace, apoi acul din stânga de pe penultimul rând iar din ultimul rând toate cele $3$ ace.

# Cerință

1. Știind că imprimanta Cif-Oji6 a tipărit numărul $N$, determinați care este cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
2. Știind că imprimanta mai are tuș pe bandă doar pentru imprimarea a $K$ puncte, determinați **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin **exact $K$ puncte**.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `imprimanta.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ și $K$ separate printr-un spațiu, unde $N$ reprezintă numărul tipărit de imprimantă iar $K$ numărul de puncte pentru care imprimanta mai are tuș.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `imprimanta.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă cea mai mare cifră a numărul $N$ pentru care s-a acționat un număr minim de ace ale grilei.
* pe cea de-a doua linie a fișierului se va scrie **cel mai mare număr natural** ce poate fi tipărit prin $K$ puncte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $10 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$;
* $14 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $30$% din punctajul fiecărui test iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $70$% din punctajul fiecărui test.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Since the environment does not have the `numpy` library installed and we have a memory constraint, we will avoid using it and use regular Python lists and loops instead. Here is the revised solution:

```python

The output for the second part of the problem does not match the expected result because the implemented algorithm adds the highest possible digit that can be printed with the remaining points until all points are used up. However, we should be maximizing the digit value, not just the count. This means we should prioritize printing '8' as often as possible since it uses 7 points, which is the highest number of points for a single digit, and then use the remaining points to print the highest possible digit that fits.

Let us rewrite the solution to correctly implement the logic for the second part:

```python
# Define the number of pins activated for each digit from 0 to 9
pins = [6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]

# Read the input data
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Solve task 1 by finding the digit with the minimum number of pins
# that has the maximum value
def largest_digit_min_pins(n):
    min_pins = float('inf')
    largest_digit = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        n //= 10
        if pins[digit] < min_pins or (pins[digit] == min_pins and digit > largest_digit):
            min_pins = pins[digit]
            largest_digit = digit
    return largest_digit

# Solve task 2 by finding the largest number that can be printed with K points
def largest_number_with_K_points(k):
    result = ''
    # Use as many '8's as possible since it has the highest pin count of 7
    num_of_8s = k // 7
    k %= 7
    # Use the remaining ink for the largest digit possible
    additional_digit = ''
    if k > 0:
        for i in range(9, -1, -1):
            if pins[i] == k:
                additional_digit = str(i)
                break
    result = additional_digit + '8' * num_of_8s
    return result

# Compute the answers for both tasks
answer1 = largest_digit_min_pins(N)
answer2 = largest_number_with_K_points(K)

# Write the output data
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{answer1}\n{answer2}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly identify the most significant digit with the minimum number of pins activated and construct the largest possible number with K points by prioritizing '8's and then using the highest-value digit that can be printed with any remaining points.

I apologize for the oversight. The expected output indicates that when there is a choice to be made between using a larger digit (like '7') that uses fewer points or a smaller digit (like '8') that uses more points, we should prioritize the larger digit even if it results in fewer total printed digits.

I will fix the bug in the second part of the problem. Rather than always starting with '8's, we will evaluate if it's better to start with '7' and then follow with '8's or just use '8's based on the total points `K`.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Define the number of pins activated for each digit from 0 to 9
pins = [6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]

# Solve task 1 by finding the digit with the minimum number of pins
# that has the maximum value
def largest_digit_min_pins(n):
    min_pins = float('inf')
    largest_digit = 0
    for digit in map(int, str(n)):
        if pins[digit] < min_pins or (pins[digit] == min_pins and digit > largest_digit):
            min_pins = pins[digit]
            largest_digit = digit
    return largest_digit

# Solve task 2 by finding the largest number that can be printed with K points
def largest_number_with_K_points(k):
    # We start with '7' if it leads to a greater first digit than starting with '8'
    # otherwise, we fill with '8's and then add the largest possible last digit
    result = ''
    if k % 7 == 0:
        # We can fill the number solely with '8's
        result = '8' * (k // 7)
    else:
        # Check if starting with '7' is a better option
        if k % 7 == 1 or (k % 7 == 6 and k // 7 > 1):
            result = '7' + '8' * ((k-4) // 7)
        else:
            # Fill with '8's and find the largest digit for the remainder
            num_of_8s = (k // 7) - 1
            remainder = k - (num_of_8s * 7)
            for i in range(9, -1, -1):
                if pins[i] <= remainder:
                    result = str(i) + '8' * num_of_8s
                    break
    return result

# Compute the answers for both tasks
answer1 = largest_digit_min_pins(N)
answer2 = largest_number_with_K_points(K)

# Write the output data
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{answer1}\n{answer2}\n")
```

This corrected version should print '74' for the second part of the problem, which is the largest possible number that can be printed with exactly 16 points. It checks if it's better to start with '7' instead of using only '8's. If starting with '7' is not better, it fills the result with '8's and finds the largest digit for any remaining points.

The previous solution still did not produce the expected result because it did not correctly calculate the optimal use of points to maximize the value of the printed number. The optimal strategy for printing the largest number with K points is to use as many '7's as possible after using '8's, as they use fewer points and have a higher value than '8'.

The algorithm should:
1. Use '8's as much as possible (since '8' uses 7 points).
2. Use a '7' if any points are left (since '7' uses 3 points).
3. If there are points left after that, continuously add '1's (since '1' uses 2 points) until no points are left.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct algorithm:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Define the number of pins activated for each digit from 0 to 9
pins = [6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]

# Solve task 1 by finding the digit with the minimum number of pins

def largest_digit_min_pins(n):
    min_pins = float('inf')
    largest_digit = 0
    for digit in map(int, str(n)):
        if pins[digit] < min_pins or (pins[digit] == min_pins and digit > largest_digit):
            min_pins = pins[digit]
            largest_digit = digit
    return largest_digit

# Solve task 2 by finding the largest number that can be printed with K points
def largest_number_with_K_points(k):
    result = ''
    while k >= 7:
        result += '8'
        k -= 7
    if k >= 3:
        result = '7' + result
        k -= 3
    result = '1' * (k // 2) + result
    return result

# Compute the answers for both tasks
answer1 = largest_digit_min_pins(N)
answer2 = largest_number_with_K_points(K)

# Write the output data
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{answer1}\n{answer2}\n")
```

This solution should correctly identify '5' as the digit requiring the least pins in the number '2852' and should correctly calculate '74' as the largest number that can be printed with 16 points.

I apologize for the confusion. The error in my previous response was that I did not correctly prioritize printing the number '7' after '8's when there are enough points left to do so. 

Let's fix the solution by adjusting the algorithm to correctly insert '7' when it's beneficial:

```python
# Define the number of pins activated for each digit from 0 to 9
pins = [6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]

# Read the input data
with open('imprimanta.in', 'r') as file:
    N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Solve task 1 by finding the digit with the minimum number of pins
# that has the maximum value
def largest_digit_min_pins(n):
    min_pins = float('inf')
    largest_digit = 0
    for digit in map(int, str(n)):
        if pins[digit] < min_pins or (pins[digit] == min_pins and digit > largest_digit):
            min_pins = pins[digit]
            largest_digit = digit
    return largest_digit

# Solve task 2 by finding the largest number that can be printed with K points
def largest_number_with_K_points(k):
    result = ''
    # Prioritize '7' if it allows us to use the remaining points more efficiently
    if k % 7 == 1 or (k > 7 and k % 7 == 6):
        result = '7'
        k -= 3
    # Use '8's to fill up as much of the remaining K points as possible
    number_of_8s = k // 7
    result += '8' * number_of_8s
    k -= number_of_8s * 7
    # Add '1' if we have 2 points left
    if k == 2:
        result = '1' + result
    return result

# Compute the answers for both tasks
answer1 = largest_digit_min_pins(N)
answer2 = largest_number_with_K_points(K)

# Write the output data
with open('imprimanta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{answer1}\n{answer2}\n")
```

This solution should correctly calculate '5' as the largest digit with the minimum number of pins in the number '2852', and '74' as the largest number that can be printed with 16 points. The updated algorithm now takes into account the specific cases where beginning with '7' makes better use of the points than just printing '8's.
