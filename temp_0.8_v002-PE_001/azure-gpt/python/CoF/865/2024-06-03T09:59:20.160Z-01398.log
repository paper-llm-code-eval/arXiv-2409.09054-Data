Alex s-a angajat în vacanța de vară ca barman. Pentru că îi place să transforme munca la bar într-un spectacol, uneori aranjează mai multe pahare identice ca formă și dimensiune, dar de capacități diferite, sub forma unei stive.

~[0.png|align=right|width=30em]
Un pahar din stivă, cu excepția celor de la bază, se sprijină pe exact două pahare din rândul de mai jos. Paharele sunt numerotate ca în imaginea alăturată. Nivelurile din stivă sunt de asemenea numerotate, începând cu $1$, de la vârf, adică paharul $1$ se află pe nivelul $1$, paharele $2$ și $3$ pe nivelul $2$, paharele $4$, $5$ și $6$ sunt pe nivelul $3$, ș.a.m.d.
\
Alex toarnă în fiecare secundă câte un mililitru de apă (o picătură) în paharul numărul $1$. Paharele au o proprietate ciudată atunci când sunt pline: primul mililitru care ajunge într-un pahar plin se va scurge instantaneu în paharul aflat imediat în stânga sa pe rândul de dedesubt, următorul mililitru se va scurge instantaneu în paharul aflat imediat în dreapta sa pe rândul de dedesubt și tot așa, alternativ câte o picătură în cele două pahare.

De exemplu, când paharul $2$ este plin, primul mililitru ce va ajunge în el se va scurge în paharul $4$, următorul mililitru se scurge în paharul $5$, al treilea mililitru se va scurge din nou în paharul $4$, ș.a.m.d.

Atunci când într-un pahar plin aflat la baza stivei ajunge un nou mililitru de apă, acesta se scurge instantaneu pe masă.

# Cerinţă
Cunoscând numărul de pahare din rândul de la baza stivei și faptul că stiva este completă (toate rândurile conțin numărul maxim de pahare ce se pot așeza după regula de mai sus, iar pe cel mai de sus rând se găsește un singur pahar), să se scrie un program care determină:
1. Care este nivelul minim (cel mai de sus) care are suma capacităților tuturor paharelor de pe nivel maximă?
2. Care este numărul minim de secunde necesar pentru a umple toate paharele folosind procedeul descris mai sus și câți mililitri de apă se risipesc (se scurg pe masă) în acest caz?

# Date de intrare
Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `pic.in` se găsește un număr natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.

Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsește un singur număr natural $N$ reprezentând numărul de pahare din rândul de la baza stivei.

Pe a treia linie a fișierului de intrare se găsesc $M = \frac{N \cdot (N+1)}{2}$ numere naturale $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_M$ separate prin câte un spațiu, $C_i$ reprezentând capacitatea (în mililitri) a paharului cu numărul $i$ din stivă.

# Date de ieşire
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire `pic.out` va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de ordine al nivelului minim (cel mai de sus) care are suma capacităților tuturor paharelor de pe nivel maximă.
Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie două numere naturale separate printr-un singur spațiu reprezentând numărul minim de secunde scurse până când toate paharele din stivă sunt pline și respectiv numărul de mililitri de apă risipiți (ajunși pe masă) în acel moment.

# Restricţii și precizări
- $2 \leq N \leq 50$
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea valoarea $V = 2$.
- $35\%$ din teste vor avea $N \leq 17$, iar $65\%$ din teste vor avea $N > 17$.
- $1 \leq C_i \leq 25$, pentru orice $1 \leq i \leq M$.

This Python script carefully manages memory by using Numpy for array operations and being conscious of the memory limit of ~8MB. It defines functions to read input, compute the required results, and write output, without using `input()` or `print()`. The script should be run in a Python environment with Numpy installed and will read from `pic.in` and write to `pic.out`.

The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the system where the program is running. Since the problem statement requires the use of highly efficient libraries and the solution should optimize both time and memory usage, it's likely that `numpy` was intended to be used.

However, given the error message and the constraint of not being able to install additional libraries in the system, we need to write a solution that doesn't rely on `numpy` or any other third-party libraries. We will instead use only built-in Python libraries, which are available by default.

Here's a revised version of the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
def read_input(filename="pic.in"):

                time += 1
            else:

                    current_glass += next_level_glass_offset + 1
                    left = True

    return time, waste

def write_output(result, filename="pic.out"):

        else:

This code uses built-in functions and manages lists manually to perform the calculations required. It should be within the constraints of the 8MB memory limit and will work on a system that does not have any third-party modules installed.

The difference between the expected and found result indicates that there is a bug in the calculation of the minimum level with the maximum capacity. The expected output is `2`, which means that the level with the sum of capacities being maximal is the second level, while the program output is `3`. This discrepancy suggests that the calculation of levels or the sum of capacities at each level is incorrect.

Upon reviewing the code, I see the algorithm designed to calculate the levels is flawed. The way it tries to reconstruct the levels from the capacities list is not correct.

Let's fix it by iterating through the capacities and assigning them to the correct level:

```python
def calculate_levels(N, capacities):
    levels = [[] for _ in range(N)]
    index = 0
    for level in range(N):
        for _ in range(level+1):
            levels[level].append(capacities[index])
            index += 1
    return levels

def compute_min_level_with_max_capacity(levels):
    max_capacity = 0
    min_level = 0
    for i, level in enumerate(levels):
        level_capacity = sum(level)
        if level_capacity > max_capacity:
            max_capacity = level_capacity
            min_level = i + 1
    return min_level

def compute_time_and_waste(N, capacities):
    levels = calculate_levels(N, capacities)
    time = 0
    waste = 0
    remaining = capacities[:]
    current_glass = 0
    left = True

    while any(rem > 0 for rem in remaining):
        if remaining[current_glass] > 0:
            remaining[current_glass] -= 1
            time += 1
        else:
            if current_glass >= N*(N-1)//2:
                waste += 1
                time += 1
            else:
                if left:
                    current_glass += N - (current_glass - sum(len(level) for level in levels[:N-1]))
                else:
                    current_glass += N + 1 - (current_glass - sum(len(level) for level in levels[:N-1]))
                left = not left

    return time, waste

def main():
    V, N, capacities = read_input()
    levels = calculate_levels(N, capacities)
    if V == 1:
        result = compute_min_level_with_max_capacity(levels)
    else:
        result = compute_time_and_waste(N, capacities)
    write_output(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation should provide the correct results, as it properly constructs the levels from the capacities list and then calculates the sum of capacities for each level to find the minimum level with the maximum capacity. The algorithm for computing time and waste has also been adjusted to better navigate through the pyramid of glasses.

The error message indicates that the `read_input` function is not defined. This is happening because I attempted to fix only a part of the program and provided an incomplete code snippet that does not include all the necessary functions.

Let's define all the necessary functions, including `read_input`, and rewrite the complete solution. Additionally, I'll correct the logic for computing the time to fill all the glasses and the amount of water wasted, as it seems to be incorrect as well.

Here's the full rewritten solution:

```python
def read_input(filename="pic.in"):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        V = int(file.readline().strip())
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        capacities = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    return V, N, capacities

def calculate_levels(N, capacities):
    levels = [[] for _ in range(N)]
    index = 0
    for level in range(N):
        for _ in range(level + 1):
            levels[level].append(capacities[index])
            index += 1
    return levels

def compute_min_level_with_max_capacity(levels):
    max_capacity = 0
    min_level = 0
    for i, level in enumerate(levels):
        level_capacity = sum(level)
        if level_capacity > max_capacity:
            max_capacity = level_capacity
            min_level = i + 1
    return min_level

def compute_time_and_waste(N, capacities):
    levels = calculate_levels(N, capacities)
    time = 0
    waste = 0
    remaining_capacities = capacities[:]
    for i in range(N * (N + 1) // 2):
        if remaining_capacities[i] == 0:
            continue
        while remaining_capacities[i] > 0:
            remaining_capacities[i] -= 1
            time += 1
            if i >= N * (N - 1) // 2:  # If it's in the bottom row
                waste += 1
            else:
                # Determine the left and right child glasses
                left_child = i + N - i // N
                right_child = left_child + 1
                # Alternate between left and right child
                i = left_child if (time // capacities[i]) % 2 == 0 else right_child

    return time, waste

def write_output(result, filename="pic.out"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            file.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{result}\n")

def main():
    V, N, capacities = read_input()
    levels = calculate_levels(N, capacities)
    if V == 1:
        result = compute_min_level_with_max_capacity(levels)
    else:
        result = compute_time_and_waste(N, capacities)
    write_output(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code should work correctly, as it defines all the necessary functions, fixes the computation of levels, and corrects the logic for computing the time and water waste. The error message should no longer appear, and the program should produce the expected output.

The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` in the `compute_time_and_waste` function, which means that the code is trying to access an index that is out of range for the `remaining_capacities` list. This suggests an issue with the logic used to alternate between the left and right child glasses.

To fix the error, we need to correctly handle the water flow from the glasses when they overflow. The water should alternate between the left and right child glasses in the level below, and we must make sure that we don't go beyond the bounds of the `remaining_capacities` list.

Let's correct the logic in the `compute_time_and_waste` function:

```python
def compute_time_and_waste(N, capacities):
    levels = calculate_levels(N, capacities)
    time = waste = 0
    glass_fill = [0] * len(capacities)  # Fill state of each glass
    level = 0  # Start with the top level
    glass = 0  # Start with the top glass
    while glass < len(capacities):
        if glass_fill[glass] < capacities[glass]:
            glass_fill[glass] += 1
            time += 1
            glass = 0  # Reset to the top glass after each drip
        else:
            # The glass is full, so the water overflows to the next level
            left_child = glass + level + 1
            right_child = left_child + 1
            level += 1  # Move to the next level
            if left_child < len(capacities):  # Left child exists
                if glass_fill[left_child] < capacities[left_child]:
                    glass = left_child
                elif right_child < len(capacities):  # Right child exists
                    glass = right_child
            else:  # Water overflows out of the pyramid
                waste += 1
                glass = 0  # Reset to the top glass after each waste
                level = 0  # Reset to the top level
    return time, waste

# Rest of the code remains unchanged...

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the revised `compute_time_and_waste` function, we simulate pouring water into the top glass, and if it overflows, we direct the water to the appropriate child glasses in the level below. We keep track of the fill state of each glass to ensure that we don't overflow a glass that is already full. If the water reaches the bottom level and overflows, we increment the `waste` counter and restart from the top glass.

This solution should now handle the water flow correctly and avoid any index out-of-range errors, providing the correct time and waste calculations.

The error message indicates that the `main` function is not defined, which suggests that the script is missing a `main` function altogether. This function is expected to be the entry point of the script where the main logic is orchestrated. As per the problem description, the primary logic includes reading input from a file, processing the data based on the task (either task `V=1` or `V=2`), and writing output to a file.

Let's rewrite the complete solution, ensuring that all necessary functions are defined and the `main` function is included:

```python

In this solution, we define all the necessary functions, including `main`, which reads the input from `pic.in`, processes it according to the value of `V`, and writes the result to `pic.out`. The `compute_time_and_waste` function has been modified to simulate pouring water until all the glasses are filled and then calculate the wasted water. This should work correctly according to the problem statement.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests that the logic for simulating the pouring of water and calculating the time and waste is incorrect. Specifically, the expected output indicates that it should take 18 seconds to fill all the glasses, with 4 milliliters of water wasted. However, the program output is 14 seconds and 0 milliliters wasted, which means the simulation of water flow is not accounting for the overflow and alternation between left and right children glasses properly.

To fix the issue, let's reimplement the `compute_time_and_waste` function with the correct logic. We need to simulate how water overflows from a full glass to its two child glasses in the row below, alternating between them. When the water reaches the base level, it should overflow out of the pyramid, which is considered as wasted water.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def compute_time_and_waste(N, capacities):
    # Calculate the total number of glasses
    total_glasses = N * (N + 1) // 2
    # Initialize the fill level of each glass to 0
    fill_levels = [0] * total_glasses
    # Start pouring water into the first glass
    current_glass = 0
    time = 0
    waste = 0
    
    # Continue pouring until all glasses are full
    while fill_levels[-N:] != capacities[-N:]:
        # Pour water into the current glass
        fill_levels[current_glass] += 1
        time += 1
        # If the current glass overflows
        if fill_levels[current_glass] > capacities[current_glass]:
            # Calculate overflown water
            overflown = fill_levels[current_glass] - capacities[current_glass]
            fill_levels[current_glass] = capacities[current_glass]
            # If it's the bottom level, water is wasted
            if current_glass >= total_glasses - N:
                waste += overflown
            else:
                # Otherwise, distribute the water to the left and right child glasses
                left_child = current_glass + N - (current_glass * (current_glass + 1) // 2)
                right_child = left_child + 1
                fill_levels[left_child] += overflown // 2
                fill_levels[right_child] += overflown // 2
                # If there's an odd amount of overflow, alternate the extra drop
                if overflown % 2 == 1:
                    if time % 2 == 1:
                        fill_levels[left_child] += 1
                    else:
                        fill_levels[right_child] += 1
            # Reset to the first glass
            current_glass = 0
        else:
            # Move to the next glass
            current_glass += 1
            
    return time, waste

# Rest of the code remains unchanged...

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution updates the `compute_time_and_waste` function to correctly handle the overflown water by distributing it to the left and right child glasses or counting it as waste if it overflows from the bottom row. Additionally, it alternates the extra drop if there's an odd amount of overflow. This should now give the correct result according to the problem statement.
