Mihai a primit de ziua lui un joc de puzzle. Jocul are $N$ piese confecționate prin lipirea unor bucăți de dimensiune $1 \cdot 1$ (ilustrate în figurile de mai jos prin `X`); aceste bucăți le vom numi în continuare, pe scurt, `X`-uri. Pentru confecționarea unei piese se respectă următoarele reguli:

* `X`-urile sunt așezate unul peste altul, formând coloane ce pot avea înălțimi diferite, apoi coloanele se aliniază în partea de jos și se lipesc între ele, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta;
* Pe o coloană sunt cel mult $9$ `X`-uri;
* Toate piesele au același număr de coloane.

~[puzzle.jpg|align=center]

În figurile $1, 2, 3, 4$ sunt piese de puzzle care respectă regulile descrise, iar în figura $5$ și în figura $6$ **NU** sunt piese de puzzle, pentru că nu pot fi obținute prin lipirea unor coloane de $X$-uri, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta.
Fiind mic, Mihai nu poate rezolva puzzle-ul, dar poate face o singură operație: alege două piese și le îmbină în dreptul laturilor de sus, răsturnând una dintre piese sus-jos (fără să o rotească sau să o răstoarne stânga-dreapta). Dacă în urma acestei operații el obține un dreptunghi format din coloane complete de $X$-uri, toate coloanele având aceeași înălțime, este mulțumit. De exemplu, piesa din figura $1$ și cea din figura $2$ pot fi îmbinate în modul descris.
În figura $7$ este piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos. În figura $8$ este ilustrat dreptunghiul care se obține din piesa din figura $1$ și piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos.
Observați că, dacă am roti piesa din figura $4$, am putea să o îmbinăm cu piesa din figura $1$, dar rotația nu este permisă.
Vom codifica o piesă printr-un număr natural, fiecare cifră din număr reprezentând (în ordine de la stânga la dreapta) câte $X$-uri se află pe coloana corespunzătoare din piesă.
De exemplu:
- piesa din figura $1$ este codificată $4232$;
- piesa din figura $2$ este codificată $1323$;
- piesa din figura $3$ este codificată $4444$;
- piesa din figura $4$ este codificată $3231$.

# Cerință

Determinați care este numărul de moduri în care Mihai poate alege câte două piese dintre cele $N$ pentru a face o operație în modul descris mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `puzzle.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă numărul de piese din joc. Pe linia a doua se găsesc $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, reprezentând codificările celor $N$ piese.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `puzzle.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris numărul cerut.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$;
* Numerele care reprezintă codificările pieselor au același număr de cifre (cel mult $5$) și nu conțin cifra $0$.
* Într-o operație nu contează care dintre piese este răsturnată, ca urmare perechea formată din piesa $a$ și piesa $b$ este considerată ca fiind aceeași cu perechea formată din piesa $b$ și piesa $a$.
* Dreptunghiul obținut în urma unei operații poate avea înălțimea mai mare decât $9$.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $N \leq 1 \ 000$.

```
This script reads the puzzle pieces from `puzzle.in`, calculates the number of combinations using the `calculate_combinations` function, and writes the result to `puzzle.out`. It uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each piece's height profile (after converting the heights to differences from the maximum possible height) and then calculates the number of valid combinations. The script is optimized for both time and memory usage and should fall within the specified constraints.

The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` indicates that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the script is being run. Since the problem statement asks for an efficient solution and allows the use of efficient libraries, it's important to have access to `numpy`. However, in this case, we can revise the solution to not use `numpy`, as its functionality is not essential for this specific problem.

Here's the revised solution without the use of `numpy`:

```python
# Function to read puzzle pieces from file and return them as a list of integers
def read_pieces(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pieces = [int(piece) for piece in file.readline().split()]
        return n, pieces

        # Convert piece to string to iterate through its digits
        heights = [max_height - int(x) for x in str(piece)]
        key = tuple(heights)
        counter[key] = counter.get(key, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the number of combinations
    combinations = 0
    for key in counter:
        # The opposite heights should match with current heights
        opposite_key = tuple(max_height - h for h in key)
        if opposite_key in counter:
            if key == opposite_key:
                # If the piece can be combined with itself, calculate combinations differently
                combinations += counter[key] * (counter[key] - 1) // 2
            else:
                combinations += counter[key] * counter[opposite_key]
    return combinations

# Read the input file, calculate the result and write to the output file
N, pieces = read_pieces('puzzle.in')
result = calculate_combinations(pieces)
write_result('puzzle.out', result)
```

This revised solution does not use the `numpy` library and instead relies only on standard Python functionality. It should compile and run correctly within the memory and time constraints provided. The logic remains the same as the previously provided code.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it becomes clear that the current implementation is not processing the pairs of pieces correctly. The issue lies in the logic of how we determine whether two pieces can form a complete rectangle (all columns having the same height after flipping one piece). The current implementation incorrectly counts combinations by trying to match the height deficits from the maximum height, which does not match the problem description.

To fix this, we need to change our approach. Instead of working with height deficits, we can directly work with heights. We can represent the heights of each column of a puzzle piece as a tuple, and the heights of the flipped piece as the complement to the maximum possible height for each column. By doing this, we can count the occurrences of each tuple representation and then calculate the valid combinations by matching each piece with its complement.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to read puzzle pieces from file and return them as a list of integers
def read_pieces(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pieces_str = file.readline().strip().split()
        pieces = [[int(height) for height in piece_str] for piece_str in pieces_str]
        return n, pieces

# Function to write the result to a file
def write_result(file_path, result):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Function to calculate the number of ways to combine pieces
def calculate_combinations(pieces):
    max_height = 9
    counter = {}

    # Count the number of pieces for each possible height profile
    for heights in pieces:
        key = tuple(heights)
        counter[key] = counter.get(key, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the number of combinations
    combinations = 0
    for heights in pieces:
        flipped = tuple(max_height - h for h in heights)
        if flipped in counter:
            combinations += counter[flipped]
            if flipped == tuple(heights):
                combinations -= 1  # Avoid counting the piece with itself

    return combinations // 2  # Each pair is counted twice

# Read the input file, calculate the result and write to the output file
N, pieces = read_pieces('puzzle.in')
result = calculate_combinations(pieces)
write_result('puzzle.out', result)
```

This solution reads the pieces into a list of lists of integers, representing the height of each column. It then computes a dictionary (`counter`) that maps each piece's height profile to the number of occurrences of that profile. When computing combinations, it increments the count for each piece by the number of its complementary pieces. Since each pair is counted twice (once for each piece in the pair), we divide the total count by 2 at the end. This corrected algorithm should provide the correct output for the given problem.

The results differ from the expected output because the current implementation incorrectly assumes that the height profile of a piece and its flipped version are complements with respect to the maximum height (in this case, 9 for each column). However, according to the problem statement, flipping a piece simply reverses the order of the columns, not their height with reference to the maximum height. We need to correct the logic to account for this.

The correct implementation should reverse the order of the heights to simulate flipping the piece upside down. We will use the same logic of counting the frequency of each height profile (represented as a tuple), but we will compare the original and reversed profiles to find pairs that can be combined into a complete rectangle.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
# Function to read puzzle pieces from file and return them as a list of integers
def read_pieces(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pieces_str = file.readline().strip().split()
        pieces = [[int(height) for height in piece_str] for piece_str in pieces_str]
        return n, pieces

# Function to write the result to a file

# Function to calculate the number of ways to combine pieces
def calculate_combinations(pieces):
    counter = {}

    # Count the number of pieces for each possible height profile
    for heights in pieces:
        key = tuple(heights)
        counter[key] = counter.get(key, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the number of combinations
    combinations = 0
    for heights in pieces:
        # Create the reversed tuple to simulate flipping the piece
        flipped = tuple(reversed(heights))
        if flipped in counter:
            combinations += counter[flipped]
            if flipped == tuple(heights):
                combinations -= 1  # Avoid counting the piece with itself

    return combinations // 2  # Each pair is counted twice

# Read the input file, calculate the result and write to the output file
N, pieces = read_pieces('puzzle.in')
result = calculate_combinations(pieces)
write_result('puzzle.out', result)
```

This solution reads the pieces into a list of lists of integers, representing the height of each column. It then computes a dictionary (`counter`) that maps each piece's height profile to the number of occurrences of that profile. When computing combinations, it increments the count for each piece by the number of its flipped versions (found by reversing the tuple of heights). Since each pair is counted twice (once for each piece in the pair), we divide the total count by 2 at the end. This corrected algorithm should provide the correct output for the given problem.

The difference between the expected and found result stems from an incorrect count of combinations in the solution. The issue in the last submission is that the code reduces the count by 1 whenever it finds a key that is equal to its flipped version without considering that there may be multiple occurrences of such a key. The reduction should only happen once for each piece when it is compared with itself, not once per occurrence.

Another issue is that the solution incorrectly calculates combinations for pieces that have an identical height profile to their flipped version. In this scenario, each piece can form a complete rectangle with any other piece of the same profile, except with itself. The count needs to be incremented considering `(count - 1)` for such pieces, as one cannot be combined with itself.

Let's fix these issues in the solution:

```python
# Function to read puzzle pieces from file and return them as a list of integers
def read_pieces(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pieces_str = file.readline().strip().split()
        pieces = [piece_str for piece_str in pieces_str]  # Store pieces as strings
        return n, pieces

# Function to write the result to a file
def write_result(file_path, result):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Function to calculate the number of ways to combine pieces
def calculate_combinations(pieces):
    counter = {}

    # Count the number of pieces for each possible height profile
    for piece in pieces:
        # Convert the piece into a tuple of integers representing its height profile
        heights = tuple(map(int, piece))
        # Increment the count for this height profile in the counter
        counter[heights] = counter.get(heights, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the number of combinations
    combinations = 0
    for piece in pieces:
        # Create the reversed tuple to simulate flipping the piece
        flipped = tuple(reversed(map(int, piece)))
        if flipped in counter:
            # If the piece profile is the same as its flipped version, avoid counting it with itself
            if piece == piece[::-1]:  # Check if piece profile is symmetric
                combinations += counter[flipped] * (counter[flipped] - 1)
            else:
                combinations += counter[flipped]
                
    # Each non-symmetric pair is counted twice (once for each piece), symmetric ones are handled inside the loop
    return combinations // 2

# Read the input file, calculate the result and write to the output file
N, pieces = read_pieces('puzzle.in')
result = calculate_combinations(pieces)
write_result('puzzle.out', result)
```

This solution should now properly account for all possible combinations, including the special case where a piece's height profile is symmetric, and it can be combined with any other piece with the same profile, except itself. After fixing these issues, the solution should provide the correct output.

The error message `TypeError: 'map' object is not reversible` indicates that we are trying to reverse a `map` object, which is not possible directly. The `map` function returns an iterator, which doesn't support being reversed. To fix this, we should first convert the `map` object into a list or tuple before reversing it. 

Here is the corrected solution that addresses this issue:

```python
# Function to read puzzle pieces from file and return them as a list of strings
def read_pieces(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())

        return n, pieces

# Function to write the result to a file

# Function to calculate the number of ways to combine pieces
def calculate_combinations(pieces):
    counter = {}

    # Count the number of pieces for each possible height profile
    for piece in pieces:
        # Convert the piece into a tuple of integers representing its height profile
        heights = tuple(map(int, piece))
        # Increment the count for this height profile in the counter
        counter[heights] = counter.get(heights, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the number of combinations
    combinations = 0
    for piece in pieces:
        # Create the reversed tuple to simulate flipping the piece
        flipped = tuple(reversed(list(map(int, piece))))
        # Increment the count of combinations
        if flipped in counter:
            # If the piece profile is the same as its flipped version, it should not be counted with itself
            if piece == piece[::-1]:  # Check if piece profile is symmetric
                combinations += counter[flipped] * (counter[flipped] - 1)
            else:
                combinations += counter[flipped]

    # Each non-symmetric pair is counted twice (once for each piece), symmetric ones are handled inside the loop
    return combinations // 2

# Read the input file, calculate the result and write to the output file
N, pieces = read_pieces('puzzle.in')
result = calculate_combinations(pieces)
write_result('puzzle.out', result)
```

This solution should now correctly reverse the height profile of the puzzle pieces and count the combinations correctly. It converts the `map` object to a list before reversing it, thus fixing the `TypeError`. After applying this fix, the solution should provide the correct output.

Apologies for the confusion. The issue with the previous solutions was in the calculation of valid combinations. The code did not properly account for the fact that each piece can be combined with any other piece once, and it incorrectly tried to handle symmetric pieces separately, which was unnecessary and introduced the error in the result.

Let's fix the code by removing the unnecessary check for symmetric pieces and ensuring that each piece is combined with each other piece exactly once.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to read puzzle pieces from file and return them as a list of integers
def read_pieces(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pieces_str = file.readline().strip().split()
        pieces = [[int(digit) for digit in piece_str] for piece_str in pieces_str]
        return n, pieces

# Function to write the result to a file
def write_result(file_path, result):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

# Function to calculate the number of ways to combine pieces
def calculate_combinations(n, pieces):
    counter = {}
    for piece in pieces:
        # Convert the piece into a tuple representing its height profile
        heights = tuple(piece)
        counter[heights] = counter.get(heights, 0) + 1
    
    combinations = 0
    for piece in pieces:
        # Create the reversed tuple to simulate flipping the piece upside down
        flipped = tuple(reversed(piece))
        # Check if there exists a complementary piece that can form a complete rectangle with the current piece
        if flipped in counter:
            combinations += counter[flipped]
    
    # After counting all valid combinations, each pair is counted twice
    return combinations // 2

# Read the input file, calculate the result and write to the output file
N, pieces = read_pieces('puzzle.in')
result = calculate_combinations(N, pieces)
write_result('puzzle.out', result)
```

This code reads the heights of the pieces, creates a counter for the frequency of each height profile, and counts the valid combinations by checking if there is a complementary piece for each piece. The count is then divided by 2 because each valid pair is counted twice (once for each piece in the pair). This should give us the expected result.
