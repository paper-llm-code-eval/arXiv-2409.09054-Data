Mihai a primit de ziua lui un joc de puzzle. Jocul are $N$ piese confecționate prin lipirea unor bucăți de dimensiune $1 \cdot 1$ (ilustrate în figurile de mai jos prin `X`); aceste bucăți le vom numi în continuare, pe scurt, `X`-uri. Pentru confecționarea unei piese se respectă următoarele reguli:

* `X`-urile sunt așezate unul peste altul, formând coloane ce pot avea înălțimi diferite, apoi coloanele se aliniază în partea de jos și se lipesc între ele, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta;
* Pe o coloană sunt cel mult $9$ `X`-uri;
* Toate piesele au același număr de coloane.

~[puzzle.jpg|align=center]

În figurile $1, 2, 3, 4$ sunt piese de puzzle care respectă regulile descrise, iar în figura $5$ și în figura $6$ **NU** sunt piese de puzzle, pentru că nu pot fi obținute prin lipirea unor coloane de $X$-uri, una după cealaltă, de la stânga spre dreapta.
Fiind mic, Mihai nu poate rezolva puzzle-ul, dar poate face o singură operație: alege două piese și le îmbină în dreptul laturilor de sus, răsturnând una dintre piese sus-jos (fără să o rotească sau să o răstoarne stânga-dreapta). Dacă în urma acestei operații el obține un dreptunghi format din coloane complete de $X$-uri, toate coloanele având aceeași înălțime, este mulțumit. De exemplu, piesa din figura $1$ și cea din figura $2$ pot fi îmbinate în modul descris.
În figura $7$ este piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos. În figura $8$ este ilustrat dreptunghiul care se obține din piesa din figura $1$ și piesa din figura $2$ răsturnată sus-jos.
Observați că, dacă am roti piesa din figura $4$, am putea să o îmbinăm cu piesa din figura $1$, dar rotația nu este permisă.
Vom codifica o piesă printr-un număr natural, fiecare cifră din număr reprezentând (în ordine de la stânga la dreapta) câte $X$-uri se află pe coloana corespunzătoare din piesă.
De exemplu:
- piesa din figura $1$ este codificată $4232$;
- piesa din figura $2$ este codificată $1323$;
- piesa din figura $3$ este codificată $4444$;
- piesa din figura $4$ este codificată $3231$.

# Cerință

Determinați care este numărul de moduri în care Mihai poate alege câte două piese dintre cele $N$ pentru a face o operație în modul descris mai sus.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `puzzle.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $N$ ce reprezintă numărul de piese din joc. Pe linia a doua se găsesc $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un singur spațiu, reprezentând codificările celor $N$ piese.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `puzzle.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris numărul cerut.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$;
* Numerele care reprezintă codificările pieselor au același număr de cifre (cel mult $5$) și nu conțin cifra $0$.
* Într-o operație nu contează care dintre piese este răsturnată, ca urmare perechea formată din piesa $a$ și piesa $b$ este considerată ca fiind aceeași cu perechea formată din piesa $b$ și piesa $a$.
* Dreptunghiul obținut în urma unei operații poate avea înălțimea mai mare decât $9$.
* Pentru teste valorând $30$ de puncte $N \leq 1 \ 000$.

    for piece in map(tuple, pieces_array):
        complement = tuple(max_height - np.array(piece))
        if complement in counter:
            # If the piece is equal to its complement,
            # we should avoid double counting
            if piece == complement: 
                combinations += (counter[complement] * (counter[complement] - 1)) // 2
            else:

    # Since every pair is counted twice, divide the result by 2
    return combinations // 2

# Find the number of combinations
num_combinations = count_combinations(pieces)

# Write to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_combinations))
```

This Python code reads the puzzle pieces from `puzzle.in`, processes them to find the number of valid combinations where two pieces can be combined, and writes the result to `puzzle.out`. It uses NumPy for efficient array manipulation and a dictionary for counting occurrences of inverted pieces. The code ensures not to double-count pairs by dividing the result by 2.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment, which leads to the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Since the program needs to be efficient both in memory and time, and the memory limit is very constrained (~8MB), it may be better to avoid third-party libraries that could potentially consume more memory than necessary, such as `numpy`.

We'll rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other external libraries, relying solely on Python's built-in capabilities to ensure the solution meets the memory and efficiency requirements.

```python
# Function to count the combinations of pieces that can form a rectangle
def count_combinations(pieces):
    # Determine the maximum possible height of the stack
    max_height = max(sum(int(digit) for digit in str(piece)) for piece in pieces)

    # Count the occurrences of each piece and its upside-down version
    piece_counts = {}
    inverted_piece_counts = {}
    for piece in pieces:
        # Convert piece to tuple of digits to be hashable
        piece_tuple = tuple(int(digit) for digit in str(piece))
        inverted_piece_tuple = tuple(max_height - int(digit) for digit in str(piece))

        # Update counts
        piece_counts[piece_tuple] = piece_counts.get(piece_tuple, 0) + 1
        inverted_piece_counts[inverted_piece_tuple] = inverted_piece_counts.get(inverted_piece_tuple, 0) + 1
    
    # Count the combinations by pairing pieces with their complementary upside-down versions
    combinations = 0
    for piece, count in piece_counts.items():
        # Find the complement piece
        complement = tuple(max_height - digit for digit in piece)
        # If complement exists, increase the combination count
        if complement in inverted_piece_counts:
            if piece == complement:
                combinations += (count * (count - 1)) // 2  # Avoid double counting identical piece pairs
            else:
                combinations += count * inverted_piece_counts[complement]
    
    return combinations

The issue with the current solution is that it counts every pair twice when the pieces are not the same, and the invariant that the complement of any piece's upside-down version is also in the list may not hold. We need to ensure that the piece and its complement are counted only once as a valid pair.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to invert a piece by flipping it upside down
def invert_piece(piece, max_height):
    return tuple(max_height - int(digit) for digit in piece)

# Function to count the combinations of pieces that can form a rectangle
def count_combinations(pieces_str):
    # Convert pieces to tuples of digits
    pieces = [tuple(map(int, str(piece))) for piece in pieces_str]

    # Determine the maximum possible height of the stack
    max_height = max(sum(piece) for piece in pieces)

    # Count the occurrences of each piece's inverted form
    inverted_piece_counts = {}
    for piece in pieces:
        # Get the inverted piece
        inverted_piece = invert_piece(piece, max_height)
        inverted_piece_counts[inverted_piece] = inverted_piece_counts.get(inverted_piece, 0) + 1
    
    # Count the combinations by checking if the inverted form is in the counts
    combinations = 0
    for piece in pieces:
        # Avoid double counting by only considering the piece if it's lexicographically smaller than its inverted form
        inverted_piece = invert_piece(piece, max_height)
        if piece <= inverted_piece:
            if inverted_piece in inverted_piece_counts:
                if piece == inverted_piece:
                    # If the inverted piece is the same as the original, it's the middle case
                    combinations += (inverted_piece_counts[inverted_piece] * (inverted_piece_counts[inverted_piece] - 1)) // 2
                else:
                    # Otherwise, we have two distinct pieces that form a valid pair
                    combinations += inverted_piece_counts[inverted_piece]
                    
    return combinations

# Read from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the number of combinations
num_combinations = count_combinations(pieces)

# Write to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_combinations))
```

In this solution, we ensure that each piece is paired with its inverted form only once by checking if the piece is lexicographically smaller than or equal to its inverted form. Additionally, to handle cases where the piece is its own complement (i.e., the piece does not change when flipped upside down), we add a special case to count these separately and avoid double counting. This logic should now give the correct output for the provided input.

The previous fix attempt still had issues in correctly counting the combinations. Specifically, we are not considering the fact that we should only combine pairs and not count a piece's combination with itself (except in the special middle case where the piece is identical to its upside-down version).

An additional mistake is that we should not be combining pieces with themselves, and we should not be incrementing the combination count for inverted pieces that do not have a corresponding piece in the original list.

Here's a reworked solution:

```python
# Function to count the combinations of pieces that can form a rectangle
def count_combinations(pieces_str):
    # Determine the maximum possible height of the stack
    max_height = max(sum(int(digit) for digit in str(piece)) for piece in pieces_str)

    # Convert pieces to lists of digits
    pieces = [tuple(int(digit) for digit in str(piece)) for piece in pieces_str]

    # Invert all pieces and count occurrences
    inverted_count = {}
    for piece in pieces:
        inverted_piece = tuple(max_height - digit for digit in piece)
        if inverted_piece in inverted_count:
            inverted_count[inverted_piece] += 1
        else:
            inverted_count[inverted_piece] = 1

    # Calculate combinations
    combinations = 0
    visited = set()
    for piece in pieces:
        # Avoid re-counting by checking if we've seen this piece configuration
        if piece not in visited:
            inverted_piece = tuple(max_height - digit for digit in piece)
            # If the inverted piece is the same as the original and we haven't seen it before, 
            # we have a special case where each pair is counted once
            if inverted_piece == piece:
                combinations += inverted_count[piece] * (inverted_count[piece] - 1) // 2
            # Otherwise, we can form combinations with distinct pieces
            elif inverted_piece in inverted_count:
                combinations += inverted_count[piece] * inverted_count[inverted_piece]
            # Mark the piece as visited
            visited.add(piece)
            visited.add(inverted_piece)

    return combinations

# Read from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the number of combinations
num_combinations = count_combinations(pieces)

# Write to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_combinations))
```

This solution ensures that each piece is only considered once by using a `visited` set to track which configurations have already been accounted for. For each piece, we count combinations with its inverted form if we have not already processed that configuration. The special case where a piece is identical to its inverted form is also handled separately to avoid double-counting. This should give the correct output of `3` for the provided input.

The error we are encountering is a `KeyError` which suggests that while trying to access the `inverted_count` dictionary for a `piece`, the key does not exist. This is happening because we're trying to use the original piece as a key in the `inverted_count` dictionary, which only contains inverted pieces.

The solution is to adjust the logic to check if the inverted piece is present in the count dictionary and only combine with pieces that have an inverted counterpart. Let's revise the code properly to fix this issue:

```python
# Function to count the combinations of pieces that can form a rectangle
def count_combinations(pieces):
    # Convert pieces to tuples of digits
    pieces_tuples = [tuple(int(digit) for digit in str(piece)) for piece in pieces]

    # Determine the maximum possible height of a column
    max_height = max(sum(piece) for piece in pieces_tuples)

    # Count the occurrences of each original and inverted piece
    original_counts = {}
    inverted_counts = {}
    for piece_tuple in pieces_tuples:
        inverted_tuple = tuple(max_height - digit for digit in piece_tuple)

        # Update the counts for original and inverted pieces
        original_counts[piece_tuple] = original_counts.get(piece_tuple, 0) + 1
        inverted_counts[inverted_tuple] = inverted_counts.get(inverted_tuple, 0) + 1

    # Count the combinations of pieces that can be combined
    combinations = 0
    for piece, count in original_counts.items():
        # Get the inverted piece
        inverted_piece = tuple(max_height - digit for digit in piece)
        
        # Check if there's a complementary piece that can be combined
        if inverted_piece in original_counts and piece != inverted_piece:
            # Since we are iterating through every piece, we need to divide the count by 2 to avoid double counting
            combinations += count * original_counts[inverted_piece] // 2
    
    # For the pieces that are the same as their inverted version, handle separately
    for piece, count in original_counts.items():
        if piece == tuple(max_height - digit for digit in piece):
            combinations += count * (count - 1) // 2

    return combinations

# Read from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the number of combinations
num_combinations = count_combinations(pieces)

# Write to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_combinations))
```

In this corrected approach, we maintain two dictionaries: one for the original pieces and one for the inverted pieces. We then iterate through the original pieces and their counts, looking up the inverted pieces in the original counts dictionary. When we find a match, we add the product of the counts to the combination total, divided by 2 to avoid double counting. We handle pieces identical to their inverted version separately, as these can only combine with themselves. This approach should resolve the `KeyError` and provide the correct output.

The issue with the current implementation is that it incorrectly handles the pairs of pieces that can form valid combinations. In particular, we have a problem with how we check if an inverted piece is present in the `original_counts`. We also incorrectly attempt to divide the count by 2 for non-identical pieces and handle identical pieces after the main loop, which leads to missing some valid combinations.

Let's fix the solution by:

1. Ensuring that we only count each valid pair of pieces once.
2. Correctly handling the combination of pieces with themselves when they are identical to their upside-down versions.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to count the combinations of pieces that can form a rectangle
def count_combinations(pieces):
    # Convert pieces to tuples of digits
    pieces_tuples = [tuple(int(digit) for digit in str(piece)) for piece in pieces]

    # Determine the maximum possible height of the stack
    max_height = 9  # Since the height of any column is at most 9

    # Count the occurrences of each inverted piece
    inverted_counts = {}
    for piece_tuple in pieces_tuples:
        # Invert the piece by subtracting each digit from the max height
        inverted_tuple = tuple(max_height - digit for digit in piece_tuple)
        inverted_counts[inverted_tuple] = inverted_counts.get(inverted_tuple, 0) + 1

    # Count the combinations
    combinations = 0
    for piece_tuple in pieces_tuples:
        # Check if the inverted piece exists in the inverted_counts
        if inverted_counts.get(piece_tuple, 0) > 0:
            # Reduce the count of the inverted piece to avoid double counting
            inverted_counts[piece_tuple] -= 1
            # Increase the combinations count
            combinations += 1

    return combinations

# Read from puzzle.in
with open('puzzle.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Find the number of combinations
num_combinations = count_combinations(pieces)

# Write to puzzle.out
with open('puzzle.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_combinations))
```

This code creates a dictionary to count all inverted pieces. Then, for each piece in the input list, it checks if there exists an inverted piece (by looking it up in the dictionary). If so, it increments the combination count and decrements the count of the inverted piece to avoid double counting.

This should now correctly output `3` for the given input, as we expect the following pairs to be valid combinations: `(222, 111)`, `(432, 123)`, and `(234, 123)`. Let's test this solution for correctness.
