Valutar este un joc care poate fi jucat de oricâţi jucători. La începutul jocului, fiecare jucător primeşte $L$ lei şi $E$ euro, precum şi un jeton numerotat cu numărul jucătorului. Mai exact, dacă există $M$ jucători, vor fi $M$ jetoane, numerotate de la $1$ la $M$.
Tabla de joc este harta unui oraş pe care este ilustrat un traseu circular ce conţine $N$ case de schimb valutar, numerotate în ordinea de pe traseu de la $1$ la $N$. Fiind circular, după casa $N$ urmează casa $1$. Pentru fiecare casă de schimb valutar se cunosc două valori $C$ şi $V$ ($C$ reprezintă câţi lei plăteşte un jucător dacă vrea să cumpere $1$ euro de la casa respectivă, iar $V$ reprezintă câţi lei primeşte jucătorul dacă vrea să vândă $1$ euro). Fiecare casă are o anumită culoare în funcţie de care jucătorul ajuns în punctul respectiv trebuie să efectueze o anumită acţiune astfel:

|Culoare|Cod|Efect|
|-|-|--------|
|Alb|A|Jucătorul nu face nimic la această mutare.|
|Roşu|R|Jucătorul primeşte un cartonaş denumit „pas”. Un jucător care are un cartonaş pas va folosi ulterior cartonaşul (o singură dată, după care cartonaşul va fi scos din joc) şi astfel evită să execute o acţiune pe care nu poate să o execute, pentru a nu fi eliminat din joc.|
|Galben|G|Jucătorul trebuie să cumpere $i$ euro (unde $i$ este numărul casei de schimb valutar la care se află). Dacă nu are suficienţi lei pentru a face acest lucru şi nu deţine un cartonaş pas, jucătorul este eliminat din joc. Dacă are un cartonaş pas, jucătorul îl va folosi şi nu va executa acţiunea, fără a fi eliminat din joc.|
|Verde|V|Jucătorul trebuie să vândă $i$ euro (unde $i$ este numărul casei de schimb valutar la care se află). Dacă nu are suficienţi euro pentru a face acest lucru şi nu deţine un cartonaş pas, jucătorul este eliminat din joc. Dacă are un cartonaş pas, jucătorul îl va folosi şi nu va executa acţiunea, fără a fi eliminat.|

Iniţial toţi jucătorii pornesc de la casa de schimb valutar $1$ care este albă. Există $N$ case de schimb valutar și $M$ jucători. Jucătorii mută pe rând în ordinea jetoanelor. Mai întâi mută jucătorul $1$, apoi $2, 3, \dots, M$. După jucătorul $M$ va muta din nou $1$ etc. La o mutare, un jucător care nu a fost eliminat din joc:

* „dă” cu zarul electronic; zarul va afişa un număr întreg $nr$;
* avansează cu $nr$ poziţii (adică dacă jetonul său este la casa $i$ va ajunge la casa $i+nr$);
* execută acţiunea asociată casei de schimb valutar în care a ajuns, în funcţie de culoarea acesteia.

Zarul electronic funcţionează astfel: la mutarea cu numărul $j$ este generat numărul $nr_j$ calculat după formula $nr_j = (a \cdot nr_{j-1}+b)\ \%\ N+1$, unde $nr_{j-1}$ este numărul generat la mutarea $j-1$; $a, b$ şi $nr_0$ sunt trei valori cunoscute, iar $\%$ reprezintă restul împărţirii întregi (mod).

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să rezolve următoarele cerinţe:

* determină numărul de jucători existenţi în joc după $X$ mutări;
* determină jucătorul care a rămas în joc şi care are cea mai mare sumă de Euro după $X$ mutări.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `valutar.in` conţine pe prima linie cerinţa care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$).
Pe a doua linie se află numerele naturale $a, b$ şi $nr_0$, cu semnificaţia din enunţ.

Pe următoarele $N$ linii sunt descrise casele de schimb valutar, câte o casă pe o linie, în ordinea de la $1$ la $N$, sub forma $Cod \ C \ V$, cu semnificaţiile din enunţ. Valorile scrise pe aceeaşi linie sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu.

```

Note: This solution is memory efficient since it uses NumPy arrays with data types that fit the problem constraints and avoids unnecessary copies of data. It should also be time efficient due to vectorized operations and the use of NumPy. However, as with any program, actual efficiency would need to be confirmed through profiling and testing with various input data sizes.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the runtime environment. Since the challenge specifies a low memory limit and we cannot guarantee the availability of third-party libraries like `numpy`, I'll rewrite the solution using plain Python lists and other built-in functionalities to avoid any dependencies.

Here's the revised solution without using `numpy`:

```python

    for j in range(1, X + 1):
        player_index = (j - 1) % M
        if not eliminated_players[player_index]:
            nr_j = (a * nr_j + b) % N + 1

result = simulate_game(task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses)

# Write the data to the output file
write_data("valutar.out", result)
```

This solution should be free of dependencies on third-party libraries and should work correctly within the provided execution environment. It uses built-in lists and operations which should be efficient enough for the constraints of the problem while staying within the memory limits.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates there may be an issue with the logic that handles the game rules, particularly how players are eliminated or how their position is updated. Let's go through the logic and debug the code.

On inspecting the code, it seems that the player position and the house index may have been incorrectly mapped. The house index should start from 0 but it seems I'm using it as if it's starting from 1.

Additionally, the part where a player is eliminated or uses a pass may not be correct. This is because the number of euros to buy or sell at each house is equal to the index of the house (1-indexed), but in the array, the houses are 0-indexed. Hence, we should use the number `player_positions[player_index] + 1` when buying or selling euros.

Let's correct these mistakes:

```python
# Solution for "Valutar" challenge with bug fixes

# Function to read data from file
def read_data(file_name):
    with open(file_name, "r") as file:

        player_index = (j - 1) % M
        if not eliminated_players[player_index]:
            nr_j = (a * nr_j + b) % N
            player_positions[player_index] = (player_positions[player_index] + nr_j) % N

                if players[player_index][0] >= required_lei:
                    players[player_index][0] -= required_lei
                    players[player_index][1] += player_positions[player_index] + 1

                else:
                    eliminated_players[player_index] = True
            elif house_code == "V":
                required_euro = player_positions[player_index] + 1
                if players[player_index][1] >= required_euro:
                    players[player_index][1] -= required_euro
                    players[player_index][0] += required_euro * V
                elif players[player_index][2]:
                    players[player_index][2] = False  # Use pass card
                else:
                    eliminated_players[player_index] = True
            elif house_code == "R":
                players[player_index][2] = True  # Get a pass card
    if task == 1:
        return sum(not eliminated for eliminated in eliminated_players)
    elif task == 2:
        max_euros = max(player[1] for player in players if not eliminated_players[players.index(player)])
        winner_index = next(i for i, player in enumerate(players) if player[1] == max_euros and not eliminated_players[i])
        return winner_index + 1  # Return player number (starting from 1)

# Read the data from the input file
task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses = read_data("valutar.in")

# Simulate the game and get the result
result = simulate_game(task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses)

# Write the data to the output file
write_data("valutar.out", result)
```

This revised solution takes into account the 0-indexing of the array and correctly calculates the number of euros to buy or sell at each house. The result should now match the expected output.

It seems there is still an issue with the logic of the solution. To determine why the results differ, let's walk through the provided example with the current logic:

1. There are 3 players, each starting with 2 lei and 3 euros.
2. There are 5 exchange houses with actions A, G, G, V, and R respectively.
3. The dice roll sequence starts with 7 and is determined by the formula: `nr_j = (3 * nr_{j-1} + 2) % 5 + 1`.
4. There are 8 moves to simulate.

The dice roll sequence will be: 7, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1 (modulo 5 then add 1).

Let's simulate the game:

- Move 1 (Player 1): Player 1 rolls a 7, which results in 7 % 5 + 1 = 3, so the player lands on house 3 (G). The player needs to buy 3 euros for 3 * 5 = 15 lei, which they can afford. They spend 15 lei and get 3 euros. They have 2-15=-13 lei and 3+3=6 euros.
- Move 2 (Player 2): Rolls a 5, lands on house 5 (R), gets a pass card.
- Move 3 (Player 3): Rolls a 4, lands on house 4 (V), sells 4 euros for 4 * 5 = 20 lei. They have 2+20=22 lei and 3-4=-1 euros. This is not possible since they can't have negative euros, but they have a pass, so they use it and don't sell any euros.
- Move 4 (Player 1): Rolls a 4, lands on house 2 (G), needs to buy 2 euros for 2 * 5 = 10 lei, but they only have -13 lei, so they are eliminated.
- Move 5 (Player 2): Rolls a 4, lands on house 4 (V), but they can't sell 4 euros as they only have 3, so they use their pass.
- Move 6 (Player 3): Rolls a 2, lands on house 1 (A), does nothing.
- Move 7 (Player 2): Rolls a 2, lands on house 1 (A), does nothing.
- Move 8 (Player 3): Rolls a 1, lands on house 2 (G), needs to buy 2 euros for 2 * 5 = 10 lei, which they can afford. They spend 10 lei and get 2 euros. They have 22-10=12 lei and 3+2=5 euros.

After 8 moves, Players 2 and 3 should still be in the game, but the current code outputs that there are 0 players left, which is incorrect.

Let's correct the code. I believe the error lies in not checking for the presence of the pass correctly. We should check if the player has a pass card before checking if they can afford to buy or sell euros. If they do have a pass card, they should use it and not be eliminated when they can't afford the transaction.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution for "Valutar" challenge with bug fixes

This correction ensures that players use their pass cards properly without being eliminated and takes the correct actions whether or not they have enough money or euros to perform transactions at the exchange houses. This should fix the previous logical errors, and the program should now provide the correct output.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. After reviewing the logic again, I realized the main issue lies in the fact that I incorrectly updated the use of the pass card. The pass card should only be used if the player does not have enough currency (lei or euro) to perform the required transaction at the exchange house. Additionally, the pass card usage flag should only be set to `False` if it is actually used during that turn.

Let's revise the code with these fixes:

```python

    with open(file_name, "r") as file:
        task = int(file.readline().strip())

    player_positions = [0] * M
    eliminated_players = [False] * M
    nr_j = nr_0
    
    for j in range(1, X + 1):
        player_index = (j - 1) % M
        if not eliminated_players[player_index]:
            nr_j = (a * nr_j + b) % N
            player_positions[player_index] = (player_positions[player_index] + nr_j) % N
            house_code, C, V = exchange_houses[player_positions[player_index]]
            house_index = player_positions[player_index] + 1  # 1-indexed
            if house_code == "G":
                if players[player_index][0] < house_index * C and players[player_index][2] > 0:
                    players[player_index][2] -= 1  # Use a pass card
                elif players[player_index][0] >= house_index * C:
                    players[player_index][0] -= house_index * C
                    players[player_index][1] += house_index
                else:
                    eliminated_players[player_index] = True
            elif house_code == "V":
                if players[player_index][1] < house_index and players[player_index][2] > 0:
                    players[player_index][2] -= 1  # Use a pass card
                elif players[player_index][1] >= house_index:
                    players[player_index][1] -= house_index
                    players[player_index][0] += house_index * V
                else:
                    eliminated_players[player_index] = True
            elif house_code == "R":
                players[player_index][2] += 1  # Get a pass card

    if task == 1:
        return sum(not x for x in eliminated_players)
    elif task == 2:
        # Find the player with the maximum number of euros who is not eliminated
        max_euros = max(players[i][1] for i in range(M) if not eliminated_players[i])
        return next(i + 1 for i in range(M) if players[i][1] == max_euros and not eliminated_players[i])

# Read the data from the input file
task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses = read_data("valutar.in")

# Simulate the game and get the result
result = simulate_game(task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses)

# Write the data to the output file
write_data("valutar.out", result)
```

With these adjustments, the code should now correctly handle the use of pass cards and eliminate players only when they cannot perform the action required by the exchange house and do not have a pass card. The `simulate_game` function now accurately represents the game's rules, and the program should provide the correct output.

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed a logical error in how the dice roll is calculated, which affects the player positions. Specifically, the calculation `nr_j = (a * nr_j + b) % N` should result in values between `0` and `N-1`, but the actual move on the board should be between `1` and `N`, inclusive. To fix this, we should add `1` to the result of the modulo operation to ensure it's within the correct range.

Additionally, there is a mistake in how the pass cards are being used. The pass card should only be used if the player cannot perform the action due to a lack of resources. The current implementation decreases the player's money or euros, even when they use a pass card, which should not happen.

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python

    nr_j = nr_0

        if not eliminated_players[player_index]:
            nr_j = (a * nr_j + b) % N  # roll the dice (0 to N-1)
            player_positions[player_index] = (player_positions[player_index] + nr_j) % N
            house_code, C, V = exchange_houses[player_positions[player_index]]
            house_index = player_positions[player_index] + 1  # house index (1 to N)

Upon reviewing the task requirements and the previous solutions, I realized there's a mistake in the dice roll calculation. The original formula given in the task is `nr_j = (a * nr_{j-1} + b) % N + 1`, where `nr_j` is the number obtained on the j-th roll, `nr_{j-1}` is the number from the previous roll, `a` and `b` are constants, and `N` is the number of exchange houses. The result of the modulo operation should be between `0` and `N-1`, and adding `1` brings it within the range of `1` to `N`.

In the previous solutions, the roll was incorrectly computed as `(a * nr_j + b) % N`, which is missing the `+1` at the end, and the dice roll was used directly to update the player position without considering that the house indices start at `1` and not `0`.

Let's correct the dice roll calculation and ensure that the player position is updated correctly according to the 1-based index of the exchange houses. Also, I will adjust the pass card logic to ensure it's only used when the player cannot afford to buy/sell.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution for "Valutar" challenge with bug fixes

# Function to read data from file
def read_data(file_name):
    with open(file_name, "r") as file:
        task = int(file.readline().strip())

        exchange_houses = []
        for _ in range(N):
            code, C, V = file.readline().split()
            exchange_houses.append((code, int(C), int(V)))
    return task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses

    player_positions = [0] * M  # player positions start from house 1, which is index 0
    eliminated_players = [False] * M
    nr_j = nr_0 - 1  # Adjust initial roll to be 0-based

    for j in range(X):
        player_index = j % M
        if eliminated_players[player_index]:
            continue  # Skip the move for eliminated players

        nr_j = (a * nr_j + b) % N + 1  # Next roll, 1 to N (1-based)
        player_positions[player_index] = (player_positions[player_index] + nr_j - 1) % N
        house_code, C, V = exchange_houses[player_positions[player_index]]
        i = player_positions[player_index] + 1  # House index (1-based)

        if house_code == "G":
            if players[player_index][0] < i * C:
                if players[player_index][2] > 0:
                    players[player_index][2] -= 1  # Use a pass card
                else:
                    eliminated_players[player_index] = True
            else:
                players[player_index][0] -= i * C
                players[player_index][1] += i
        elif house_code == "V":
            if players[player_index][1] < i:
                if players[player_index][2] > 0:
                    players[player_index][2] -= 1  # Use a pass card
                else:
                    eliminated_players[player_index] = True
            else:
                players[player_index][0] += i * V
                players[player_index][1] -= i
        elif house_code == "R":
            players[player_index][2] += 1  # Receive a pass card

    if task == 1:
        return sum(not x for x in eliminated_players)  # Count the non-eliminated players
    else:  # for task == 2
        max_euros = max(players[i][1] for i in range(M) if not eliminated_players[i])
        winner_index = next(i + 1 for i in range(M) if players[i][1] == max_euros and not eliminated_players[i])
        return winner_index

# Read the data from the input file
task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses = read_data("valutar.in")

# Simulate the game and get the result
result = simulate_game(task, a, b, nr_0, N, M, L, E, X, exchange_houses)

# Write the data to the output file
write_data("valutar.out", result)
```

With these corrections, we now have the correct dice roll sequence that matches the game's requirements, and the positions of the players are updated properly. Also, pass cards are used correctly when players cannot afford the required transactions. The program should now provide the correct output for the input provided.
