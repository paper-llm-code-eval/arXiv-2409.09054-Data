        while queue and level < D:

# Write output to file

```

This solution reads the input from `tairos.in`, processes the tree to find the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinitely extended tree, and writes the result to `tairos.out`. The solution should efficiently handle memory, using numpy for optimized numerical operations. The calculation of nodes at distance `D` is optimized for both cases when `D` is less than the height of the tree (using BFS) and when `D` is greater or equal to the height of the tree (using mathematical formulas).

It appears that the program exited with code 1 due to the `numpy` library not being installed or not available in the execution environment. Since we need to optimize for memory and cannot rely on third-party libraries like `numpy`, we will need to replace any `numpy` specific code with standard Python code.

Let's rewrite the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read input from file
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    D = int(f.readline().strip())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f.readlines()]

# Initialize adjacency list and degrees
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
degrees = [0] * (N + 1)

# Fill adjacency list and degrees
for x, y in edges:
    adj_list[x].append(y)
    adj_list[y].append(x)
    degrees[x] += 1
    degrees[y] += 1

# Function to calculate powers of a number under modulo
def pow_mod(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    base %= mod
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent & 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        exponent >>= 1
        base = (base ** 2) % mod
    return result

# Function to calculate number of nodes at a distance D
def count_nodes_at_distance(D):
    if D == 0:
        return 1
    leaves = sum(1 for degree in degrees[2:] if degree == 1)
    if D == 1:
        return leaves
    # Number of nodes at distance D is the sum of leaves raised to the power of D - 1
    return leaves * pow_mod(leaves + 1, D - 1, MOD) % MOD

# Calculate number of nodes at distance D
nodes_at_distance = count_nodes_at_distance(D)

# Write output to file
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(nodes_at_distance))
```

This solution should work within the memory limitations, as it uses standard Python lists and primitives to calculate the result without the overhead of `numpy`. Additionally, it ensures that all numbers are calculated under the modulo to keep memory usage in check. The solution reads from `tairos.in` and writes to `tairos.out` as required.

The bug in the previous implementation lies in the calculation of the number of nodes at distance `D`. The calculation was incorrect because it did not properly account for the recursive structure of the tree when leaves are expanded at each stage. The calculation needs to consider the structure of the tree and how it grows at each recursive step.

Here is an updated solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def read_tree():
    with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        D = int(file.readline().strip())
        edges = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            u, v = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
            edges[u].append(v)
            edges[v].append(u)
        return N, D, edges

def count_nodes(N, D, edges):
    # Calculate the number of children for each node
    children = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        children[edges[i][0]] += 1

    # Calculate nodes at distance D
    count = 0
    if D < N:
        # For D within the original tree, perform a BFS search
        queue = [(1, 0)]  # (node, distance)
        while queue:
            node, distance = queue.pop(0)
            if distance == D:
                count += 1
            elif distance < D:
                for child in edges[node]:
                    queue.append((child, distance + 1))
    else:
        # For D beyond the original tree, calculate using the property of the tree
        leaf_expansions = D // (N - 1)  # How many times the leaves have fully expanded
        distance_in_expansion = D % (N - 1)  # Distance within the current expansion
        pow_children = pow(2, leaf_expansions, MOD) - 1  # Children count at the last full expansion

        # Add the nodes from the last full expansion
        count = (children[1] * pow_children) % MOD
        if distance_in_expansion > 0:
            # Add the nodes from the current partial expansion
            count += children[1]
            if distance_in_expansion > 1:
                # Add the children of expanded leaves in the current expansion
                count += (children[1] * (distance_in_expansion - 1)) % MOD
    return count % MOD

def write_output(count):
    with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count))

N, D, edges = read_tree()
node_count = count_nodes(N, D, edges)
write_output(node_count)
```

This new solution should now correctly calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root by considering the recursive structure of the tree and how it grows when leaves are expanded at each stage. It separates the calculation for when `D` is within the original tree and when `D` requires counting nodes in expanded trees. The solution reads input from `tairos.in` and writes output to `tairos.out`.

The previous solution has incorrect logic for calculating the number of nodes at distance `D`. The main issue is that it does not correctly handle the distribution of nodes at various levels of the tree, particularly when the tree is extended by replacing leaves with an identical copy of the original tree. 

We need to correct the approach by first computing the number of nodes at each level of the original tree, then using that information to calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` in the extended tree. Let's revise the algorithm and rewrite the solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def read_tree():
    with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        D = int(file.readline().strip())
        connections = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N - 1)]
        return N, D, connections

def build_tree(N, connections):
    tree = {}
    for node in range(1, N + 1):
        tree[node] = []
    for node1, node2 in connections:
        tree[node1].append(node2)
        tree[node2].append(node1)
    return tree

def count_nodes(N, D, tree):
    # BFS to calculate the depth of each node and count nodes at each depth
    depth_count = [0] * N
    visited = [False] * (N + 1)
    queue = [(1, 0)]  # (node, depth)
    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.pop(0)
        if not visited[node]:
            visited[node] = True
            depth_count[depth] += 1
            for child in tree[node]:
                if not visited[child]:
                    queue.append((child, depth + 1))
    
    # At each level i in the original tree, the number of nodes at level i in the extended part
    # is depth_count[i] * (number of nodes in the subtree rooted at that level)
    nodes = sum(depth_count[i] * max(0, D - i) for i in range(N))
    
    return nodes % MOD

def write_output(count):
    with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count))

N, D, connections = read_tree()
tree = build_tree(N, connections)
node_count = count_nodes(N, D, tree)
write_output(node_count)
```

This solution first builds the tree structure from the input file, then runs a BFS to calculate the depth of each node. It calculates the number of nodes at each depth in the original tree and uses that information to find the total number of nodes at distance `D` in the extended tree. The solution writes the result to `tairos.out`.

The bug in the previous implementation lies in the logic to calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` in the extended tree. To address this, we should analyze the tree's growth pattern at each recursive extension. When a leaf node is extended, it adds an entire subtree identical to the original tree (except the root node). Therefore, the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root can be calculated based on the number of leaves at each level of recursion.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def read_tree():
    with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        D = int(file.readline().strip())
        edges = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            u, v = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
            edges[u].append(v)
            edges[v].append(u)
        return N, D, edges

def bfs(N, edges):
    visited = [False] * (N + 1)
    depth = [0] * (N + 1)
    leaves = []
    queue = [1]
    visited[1] = True
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if len(edges[node]) == 1 and node != 1:
            leaves.append(depth[node])
        for next_node in edges[node]:
            if not visited[next_node]:
                visited[next_node] = True
                queue.append(next_node)
                depth[next_node] = depth[node] + 1
    
    return [l for l in leaves if l <= D]

def count_nodes_at_distance(D, leaf_depths):
    count = 0
    for leaf_depth in leaf_depths:
        # Number of nodes at distance D from each leaf is D - leaf_depth + 1
        # (plus 1 because subtree root is counted)
        if leaf_depth < D:
            count += D - leaf_depth
        else:
            count += 1
    return count

def write_output(count):
    with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count))

N, D, edges = read_tree()
leaf_depths = bfs(N, edges)
result = count_nodes_at_distance(D, leaf_depths)
write_output(result)
```

This solution first performs a BFS to find the depth of each leaf node. Then, it calculates the number of nodes at distance `D` from each leaf. It takes into account the number of nodes added by each leaf at each depth of the tree and sums these up to calculate the final answer. The solution writes the result to `tairos.out`.

It seems that the previous implementations failed to correctly account for how the tree expands at each recursive step. We need to consider that at each step, each leaf node is replaced with the original tree minus the root. This problem essentially requires us to calculate how many times the nodes at certain depths contribute to the count of nodes at distance `D`.

Here is a corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def read_input():
    with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline())
        D = int(file.readline())
        tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, N+1)}
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            tree[a].append(b)
            tree[b].append(a)
        return N, D, tree

def find_depths(tree, N):
    depth = [0] * (N + 1)
    visited = [False] * (N + 1)
    stack = [(1, 0)]
    while stack:
        node, d = stack.pop()
        visited[node] = True
        depth[node] = d
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                stack.append((neighbor, d + 1))
    return depth

def count_nodes_at_distance(N, D, tree):
    depth = find_depths(tree, N)
    leaf_depths = [d for i, d in enumerate(depth) if len(tree[i]) == 1 and i != 1]
    # Root contributes 1 if D == 0
    count = 1 if D == 0 else 0
    for d in leaf_depths:
        # For each depth d, count how many nodes are at distance D
        # This is done by seeing how many times we can fit the tree on the path from the root to distance D
        while d <= D:
            count += (D - d) // (N - 1) + 1
            d += N - 1
    return count % MOD

# Read input
N, D, tree = read_input()

# Count the nodes
count = count_nodes_at_distance(N, D, tree)

# Write the output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(count))
```

This solution should now correctly compute the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the recursive tree structure. The `find_depths` function calculates the depth of each node from the root. Then, `count_nodes_at_distance` uses the depth of each leaf node to determine how many times nodes at this depth contribute to the node count at a distance `D`. Finally, the answer is written to `tairos.out`.

The error indicates a `KeyError` at `tree[i]` when `i` is `0`. This KeyError is arising because the `enumerate` function by default starts indexing from `0`, and the tree dictionary we created starts indexing from `1`. Since there is no key `0` in the tree, the program crashes.

I will address the issue by starting the enumeration from `1` and rewrite the solution with the necessary fix:

    for leaf_depth in leaf_depths:
        current_depth = leaf_depth
        while current_depth <= D:
            count += 1
            count += (D - current_depth) // (N - 1)
            current_depth += (D - current_depth) // (N - 1) * (N - 1) + (N - 1)
    return count % MOD

# Read input
N, D, tree = read_input()

# Count the nodes
count = count_nodes_at_distance(N, D, tree)

# Write the output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(count))
```

This corrected solution should now handle the zero-indexing correctly and avoid the KeyError by starting the enumeration from `1`. It correctly counts the number of nodes at distance `D` by calculating the contributions from each leaf node in the tree. The final count is then written to `tairos.out`.
