This solution uses `numpy` for efficient array operations and works within the memory limit to handle the required constraints. Please note that some variables (such as `queue`) could have been managed in a more memory-efficient manner, but due to the constraints, this should not be an issue.

It seems that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where this code is being executed. Since we cannot use `numpy` and we have to optimize for both time and memory, we will need to avoid using any libraries that are not part of the Python Standard Library and manage the memory usage manually.

Here's a revised solution that uses only built-in data structures and functions:

```python
# Read input
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N, D = map(int, file.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Create a list to hold the degree of each node
degree = [0] * (N + 1)
for x, y in edges:
    degree[x] += 1
    degree[y] += 1

# Calculate nodes at distance D
def nodes_at_distance_D(N, D, degree):
    MOD = 1000000007
    leaf_nodes = [1]  # start with the root node

    # Compute nodes at each level until we reach level D
    nodes_at_each_level = [1] + [0] * D
    for level in range(1, D + 1):
        new_leaf_nodes = []
        for node in leaf_nodes:
            child_count = degree[node] - (1 if node != 1 else 0)
            nodes_at_each_level[level] += child_count
            new_leaf_nodes.extend([node] * child_count)
        leaf_nodes = new_leaf_nodes

    # Calculate number of nodes at distance D
    count = 0
    for level in range(D + 1):
        count = (count + nodes_at_each_level[level] * nodes_at_each_level[D - level]) % MOD

    return count

# Write output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(nodes_at_distance_D(N, D, degree)))
```

This solution uses lists instead of numpy arrays and performs all computations using these lists. The memory usage is minimized by avoiding any unnecessary data structures and computations. The algorithm computes the degree of each node, then uses a breadth-first search approach to find the number of nodes at each level of the tree up to distance `D`, storing these counts in the list `nodes_at_each_level`. Finally, it calculates the total number of nodes at distance `D` by combining the counts from corresponding levels that add up to `D`. This solution should be memory-efficient and meet the challenge's constraints.

The error indicates that the program expected to read two values on the first line of the input file (`N` and `D`), but only one value was found. This means there might be a formatting issue with the input file. According to the problem statement, `N` should be on the first line, and `D` should be on the second line. We need to fix the reading part to accommodate this.

Let me correct the code based on the error and the input file format described in the problem statement:

```python
# Read input
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline())
    D = int(file.readline())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Create a list to hold the degree of each node
degree = [0] * (N + 1)
for x, y in edges:
    degree[x] += 1
    degree[y] += 1

# Calculate nodes at distance D
def nodes_at_distance_D(N, D, degree):
    MOD = 1000000007
    # Initialize the number of nodes at each distance
    nodes_at_dist = [0] * (D + 1)
    nodes_at_dist[0] = 1  # The root node is at distance 0
    
    # A function to calculate the number of leaf nodes at a given distance
    def count_leaf_nodes_at_dist(dist):
        if dist == 0:
            return 1
        count = 0
        for node in range(2, N + 1):  # Skip the root node
            if degree[node] == 1:  # It's a leaf node
                # Subtract the distance to the root node from the current distance
                count = (count + nodes_at_dist[dist - (N - 1)]) % MOD
        return count
    
    # Calculate the number of nodes at each distance
    for dist in range(1, D + 1):
        nodes_at_dist[dist] = count_leaf_nodes_at_dist(dist)
    
    return nodes_at_dist[D]

# Write output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(nodes_at_distance_D(N, D, degree)))
```

This code should now correctly read the values for N and D from the input file and then continue with the logic to calculate the number of nodes at distance D from the root node, while handling the memory limitations as per the initial constraints.

The code provided does not correctly implement the problem's logic. Specifically, the `count_leaf_nodes_at_dist` function seems to have an incorrect implementation; it incorrectly assumes that all leaf nodes are at the same distance from the root, which is not true. Also, the function attempts to calculate the number of leaf nodes at a specific distance directly, which does not account for the recursive nature of the problem, where each leaf node becomes a root of a new tree identical to the original tree.

Let me provide a re-implemented solution that correctly models the problem. We'll need to consider that each leaf node at distance `d` from the root will contribute a subtree identical to the original, and we should count nodes at distance `D - d` from the root in each of those subtrees.

```python
# Read input
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline())
    D = int(file.readline())
    edges = {i: [] for i in range(1, N + 1)}
    for line in file:
        x, y = map(int, line.split())
        edges[x].append(y)
        edges[y].append(x)

# Create a list to hold the number of children for each node and initialize it
num_children = [0] * (N + 1)

# Perform a depth-first search to count the number of children and find the number of leaf nodes
def dfs(node, parent):
    leaf = True
    for child in edges[node]:
        if child != parent:
            num_children[node] += dfs(child, node)
            leaf = False
    return 1 if leaf else num_children[node]

# Start DFS from the root node (which is node 1)
dfs(1, -1)

# Calculate nodes at distance D
MOD = 1000000007

# Initialize the number of nodes at each distance up to D as 0
nodes_at_dist = [0] * (D + 1)
nodes_at_dist[0] = 1  # The root node is at distance 0

# Calculate nodes at each distance
for d in range(1, D + 1):
    for node in range(2, N + 1):  # Start from node 2 since the root (node 1) is not a leaf
        if num_children[node] == 0:  # It's a leaf node
            if d >= N - 1:  # The subtree only contributes if d is greater or equal to N - 1
                nodes_at_dist[d] += nodes_at_dist[d - (N - 1)]
                nodes_at_dist[d] %= MOD

# Write output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(nodes_at_dist[D]))
```

I've fixed the logic by using a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of children for each node, which helps us identify leaf nodes. Then, I calculate the number of nodes at each distance by considering the contributions from subtrees rooted at leaf nodes. The solution avoids any unnecessary memory usage and should be efficient in both time and space.

The previous solution still contained an incorrect approach. It didn't properly model the recursive expansion of the tree for each leaf node. The problem states that each leaf node at distance `d` from the root will contribute a subtree identical to the original tree at every stage of the process, and this must happen recursively. We need to adjust the algorithm to account for this.

Here is a corrected solution that uses dynamic programming to count the number of nodes at each level of the original tree, and then uses this information to calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` in the infinite tree:

```python
# Read input
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline())
    D = int(file.readline())
    adjacency_list = {i: [] for i in range(1, N + 1)}
    for line in file:
        x, y = map(int, line.split())
        adjacency_list[x].append(y)
        adjacency_list[y].append(x)

# Perform a BFS to determine the number of nodes at each level in the original tree
levels = [0] * (N + 1)  # levels[i] will store the number of nodes at level i
queue = [(1, 0)]
visited = set()

while queue:
    node, level = queue.pop(0)
    if node not in visited:
        visited.add(node)
        levels[level] += 1
        for neighbor in adjacency_list[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, level + 1))

# Now we calculate the number of nodes at distance D in the infinite tree
# Initialize dp array, where dp[i] represents the number of nodes at distance i
dp = [0] * (D + 1)
dp[0] = 1  # The root node itself

MOD = 1000000007

for d in range(1, D + 1):
    for i in range(1, min(N, d + 1)):
        dp[d] = (dp[d] + levels[i] * dp[d - i]) % MOD

# Write output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(dp[D]))
```

This solution first performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to fill the `levels` array, which represents the number of nodes at each level in the original tree. We then use dynamic programming to calculate the number of nodes at each distance from the root in the infinite tree. The dynamic programming array `dp` represents the number of nodes at a given distance. For each distance `d`, and for each level `i` in the original tree, if a subtree is attached to a node at level `i`, it will contribute `levels[i]` times the number of nodes at distance `d - i` from the root of the subtree. The final result is the value of `dp[D]`, which is the answer we write to the output file. This approach ensures that we count all nodes at distance `D` correctly, taking into account the recursive structure of the infinite tree.

The previous solution does not correctly account for the problem's recursive nature, and the dynamic programming part is not accurately computing the number of nodes at a given distance in the infinite tree. The problem must be solved by understanding the expansion of the tree through the replacement of leaf nodes at each stage.

Let's approach this step by step:

1. Perform a BFS from the root to determine the number of nodes at each level of the original tree.
2. Compute the number of nodes at distance `D` by considering the recursive replacement of the leaf nodes.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

# Read input
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline())
    D = int(file.readline())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Build the adjacency list for the tree
adjacency_list = defaultdict(list)
for x, y in edges:
    adjacency_list[x].append(y)
    adjacency_list[y].append(x)

# Perform BFS to determine the number of nodes at each level
level_counts = [0] * N  # level_counts[i] stores the number of nodes at level i
queue = deque([(1, 0)])  # Start BFS from the root node with level 0
visited = set([1])

while queue:
    node, level = queue.popleft()
    level_counts[level] += 1
    for neighbor in adjacency_list[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, level + 1))

# Calculate the number of nodes at distance D in the infinite tree
MOD = 1000000007
result = 0

# If D is within the original tree, we can take the count directly from level_counts
if D < N:
    result = level_counts[D]
else:
    # For each level that can have expanded nodes contributing to distance D
    for i in range(1, N):  # We start from 1 since the root node does not expand
        # The distance remaining after reaching a node at level i
        remaining_distance = D - i
        # The number of times the entire tree contributes to the remaining_distance
        contributions = remaining_distance // (N - 1)
        if remaining_distance % (N - 1) == 0:
            # We subtract one because the entire tree should not be counted when remaining_distance is an exact multiple of (N - 1)
            contributions -= 1
        # Add the number of nodes at level i multiplied by the number of contributions
        result = (result + level_counts[i] * contributions) % MOD

# Write output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution correctly calculates the number of nodes at a given level in the original tree and then uses this information to determine the number of nodes at distance `D` in the infinite tree. It takes into account the recursive expansion of the tree and computes the contributions of each level to the count of nodes at distance `D`. This solution should now provide the expected output for the given input.
