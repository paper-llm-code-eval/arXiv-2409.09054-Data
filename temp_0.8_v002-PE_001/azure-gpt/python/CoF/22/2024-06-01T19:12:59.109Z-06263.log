This solution reads the input data from `tairos.in`, counts the leaves and distances from the root, then calculates the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinite tree. The result is written to `tairos.out`.

Please note that this solution assumes that an efficient algorithm for counting the nodes at distance `D` in the infinite tree can be derived from the number of leaves and their distribution. The `count_nodes_at_distance_D` function embodies this logic. If additional insights reveal a more nuanced approach to computing this number directly, the function can be adjusted accordingly.

The exit code indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. To fix the program, I will rewrite it without using `numpy`. Here's the revised solution:

            is_leaf = False
    if is_leaf and current != 1:
        leaves += 1

# Calculate number of nodes at distance D from the root in the infinite tree

This version removes the dependency on `numpy` and performs the computations using standard Python data structures and functions.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output is due to a bug in the logic that calculates the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinite tree. The original logic does not correctly handle the case when `D` is greater than `N`, which requires a different approach to account for the repeated subtrees that stem from the leaves after each iteration.

Here's the revised solution that correctly implements the logic for calculating the number of nodes at distance `D`:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read the input from the file
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    D = int(file.readline().strip())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Initialize adjacency list
adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
for x, y in edges:
    adjacency_list[x].append(y)
    adjacency_list[y].append(x)

# Use BFS to find the distance of each node from the root and count the leaves
distances = [-1] * (N + 1)
queue = [1]
distances[1] = 0
leaf_count = 0

while queue:
    current = queue.pop(0)
    for neighbor in adjacency_list[current]:
        if distances[neighbor] == -1:
            distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
            queue.append(neighbor)
    if len(adjacency_list[current]) == 1 and current != 1:
        leaf_count += 1

# Calculate the number of nodes at distance D from the root in the infinite tree
def calculate_nodes_at_distance_d(D, N, leaf_count, distances):
    if D < N:
        return distances.count(D) % MOD
    else:
        # The number of nodes at distance D is equal to the number of nodes at distance D % N
        # plus the number of leaves raised to the power of D // N
        return (distances.count(D % N) + pow(leaf_count, D // N, MOD)) % MOD

# Calculate and write the output
result = calculate_nodes_at_distance_d(D, N, leaf_count, distances)
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution corrects the calculation logic and should output the correct number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinite tree. It first counts the number of nodes at each distance in the original tree, then uses the repeating structure of the infinite tree to compute the final count for distance `D`.

The discrepancy in the results is because the original solution did not correctly account for how the infinite tree grows at each step. Every leaf at distance `d` from the root in the original tree will contribute to the count of nodes at distance `D` in the infinite tree if `D >= d`. However, every time we append the original tree to a leaf, the distance increases by `N - 1`, not `N`, because we are appending to the leaf, and the leaf itself is counted once only in the initial tree.

We need to fix the calculation by considering that each leaf will contribute to the nodes at distance `D` if `D` can be expressed as `d + k * (N - 1)` for some non-negative integer `k`, where `d` is the distance of the leaf from the root in the original tree.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read the input from the file
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    D = int(file.readline().strip())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Initialize adjacency list
adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
for x, y in edges:
    adjacency_list[x].append(y)
    adjacency_list[y].append(x)

# Use BFS to find the distance of each node from the root and count the leaves
distances = [-1] * (N + 1)
queue = [1]
distances[1] = 0
leaf_distances = {}

while queue:
    current = queue.pop(0)
    for neighbor in adjacency_list[current]:
        if distances[neighbor] == -1:
            distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
            queue.append(neighbor)
    if len(adjacency_list[current]) == 1 and current != 1:
        leaf_distances[distances[current]] = leaf_distances.get(distances[current], 0) + 1

# Calculate the number of nodes at distance D from the root in the infinite tree
def calculate_nodes_at_distance_d(D, N, leaf_distances):
    nodes_at_d = 0
    for leaf_distance, count in leaf_distances.items():
        if D >= leaf_distance and (D - leaf_distance) % (N - 1) == 0:
            nodes_at_d += count * pow(count, (D - leaf_distance) // (N - 1), MOD)
            nodes_at_d %= MOD
    return nodes_at_d

# Calculate and write the output
result = calculate_nodes_at_distance_d(D, N, leaf_distances)
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')

The results differ because the logic used to calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` is incorrect. We need to consider how many times the original tree is appended to each leaf depending on the distance `D`, and not multiply the count of leaves by itself.

Let's re-implement the correct solution, considering the structure of the infinite tree and how it grows:

1. Count the number of leaves in the original tree.
2. Count the distance of each leaf from the root node.
3. For each leaf, calculate how many times the original tree can be appended to it within the distance `D`.
4. Add up the number of nodes that are at the exact distance `D` in each appended tree.

Here's the correct Python code for the solution:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Read the input from the file
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    D = int(file.readline().strip())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Initialize adjacency list
adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
for x, y in edges:
    adjacency_list[x].append(y)
    adjacency_list[y].append(x)

# Use BFS to find the distance of each node from the root and to count the leaves
distances = [-1] * (N + 1)
queue = [1]
distances[1] = 0
leaves = []

while queue:
    current = queue.pop(0)
    if len(adjacency_list[current]) == 1 and current != 1:
        leaves.append(distances[current])
    for neighbor in adjacency_list[current]:
        if distances[neighbor] == -1:
            distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
            queue.append(neighbor)

# Calculate the number of nodes at distance D from the root in the infinite tree
def calculate_nodes_at_distance_d(D, N, leaves):
    nodes_at_d = 0
    # Nodes in the initial tree at distance D
    nodes_at_d += distances[1:].count(D)
    # Nodes in appended trees at distance D
    for leaf_distance in leaves:
        remaining_distance = D - leaf_distance
        if remaining_distance >= 0 and remaining_distance % (N - 1) == 0:
            nodes_at_d += pow(2, remaining_distance // (N - 1), MOD)
            nodes_at_d %= MOD
    return nodes_at_d

# Calculate and write the output
result = calculate_nodes_at_distance_d(D, N, leaves)
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This code counts the number of leaves in the original tree and their distances from the root, then it calculates how many nodes are at the exact distance `D` by considering both the nodes in the original tree and the nodes in the appended subtrees. The result is the total number of nodes at distance `D` modulo `MOD`, which we write to `tairos.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates an error in the logic that calculates the count of new nodes at distance `D`. The calculation must consider how many times each leaf's subtree contributes to the distance `D`. The error lies in treating each subtree as an independent tree and not considering the shared path to the root. We need to count the nodes in the subtrees that are exactly at the remaining distance from `D` after reaching each leaf.

Here's the correct implementation, which should give the right count:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

def bfs(adj_list, N):
    queue = [1]
    distances = [-1] * (N + 1)
    distances[1] = 0
    leaves = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if len(adj_list[node]) == 1 and node != 1:
            leaves.append(distances[node])
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if distances[neighbor] == -1:
                distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return leaves

def calculate_nodes(N, D, leaves):
    if D < N:
        # At distances less than N, we only have the original tree to consider
        return 1 if D == 0 else len([x for x in leaves if x == D])
    else:
        # At distances greater than or equal to N, we start considering additional trees
        nodes_at_d = 0
        for leaf_dist in leaves:
            if D >= leaf_dist:
                # We calculate the number of times the tree structure repeats
                repeats = (D - leaf_dist) // (N - 1)
                # The subtree contributes to the nodes count if it fits in the remaining distance
                if leaf_dist + repeats * (N - 1) == D:
                    nodes_at_d += pow(2, repeats, MOD)
        return nodes_at_d % MOD

# Read input
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    D = int(file.readline().strip())
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        x, y = map(int, file.readline().split())
        adj_list[x].append(y)
        adj_list[y].append(x)

# Process input
leaves = bfs(adj_list, N)
result = calculate_nodes(N, D, leaves)

# Write output
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This code performs BFS to find all leaf nodes and their distances from the root. Then, it calculates the number of nodes at distance `D` using the leaves' information, considering the repeating structure of the tree and the shared paths. The result is written to the output file `tairos.out`.
