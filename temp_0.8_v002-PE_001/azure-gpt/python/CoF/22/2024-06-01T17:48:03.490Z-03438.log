Note: This solution assumes that the input tree is small enough to be stored in memory without exceeding the ~8MB limit. The dynamic programming approach is used to store the number of ways to reach each node at a certain distance, up to distance D. We only consider leaf nodes (nodes of degree 1) for the final sum, as these are the ones that will be replaced by the original tree at each step. Subtrees rooted at non-leaf nodes will not contribute to new nodes at exactly distance D. The solution is modulo 1000000007 to handle large numbers.

```
This solution reads from `tairos.in`, processes the input to count nodes at a given distance in an infinite tree expansion, and writes the result to `tairos.out`. It uses NumPy for efficient array operations, and dynamic programming to calculate the number of nodes at each distance from the root. The solution avoids using `input()` and `print()` for I/O operations, as specified.

The error indicates that the NumPy module is not available. Since the provided environment might not have access to external libraries such as NumPy, and we have a stringent memory limit, we should avoid using it and rely solely on built-in Python data structures and algorithms. Here, I'll rewrite the solution without using NumPy:

```python
def read_tree(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        D = int(file.readline().strip())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N - 1)]
    return N, D, edges

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")

def count_nodes_at_distance(N, D, edges):
    # Create an adjacency list representation of the tree
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for x, y in edges:
        adj_list[x].append(y)
        adj_list[y].append(x)

    # Determine the degree of each node
    degree = [len(adj_list[node]) for node in range(N + 1)]

    # Initialize the dynamic programming table
    dp = [[0] * (D + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
    dp[1][0] = 1  # Root node at distance 0

    # Dynamic programming to find the number of nodes at each distance
    for dist in range(1, D + 1):
        for node in range(2, N + 1):
            if degree[node] == 1:  # Leaf nodes
                dp[node][dist] = dp[1][dist - 1]
            else:  # Internal nodes
                dp[node][dist] = sum(dp[adj][dist - 1] for adj in adj_list[node] if adj != 1)

    # Count the total number of nodes at distance D
    count = sum(dp[node][D] for node in range(2, N + 1) if degree[node] == 1) % (10**9 + 7)
    return count

# Read the input tree
N, D, edges = read_tree('tairos.in')

# Count the nodes at the given distance
result = count_nodes_at_distance(N, D, edges)

# Write the result to the output file
write_output('tairos.out', result)
```

This solution should work within the memory limits and without external libraries like NumPy. The dynamic programming logic remains the same, but we use lists of lists instead of NumPy arrays. The modulo operation is applied during the sum to manage memory and avoid integer overflow.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it is apparent that there is an issue with the dynamic programming approach in the current implementation. The logic for computing the number of nodes at a certain distance seems to be flawed.

The current implementation assumes that leaf nodes at a certain distance will be the only contributors to the count of nodes at distance `D`. However, it is not correctly accumulating the counts from different subtrees for internal nodes, and it's incorrectly assigning the value of the root at `dist - 1` to the leaves, which does not consider the structure of the tree expansion.

We need to adjust the dynamic programming approach to accurately reflect the problem statement. Specifically, we need to correctly handle the accumulation of the counts from subtrees of internal nodes.

Let's rewrite the solution with a correct approach:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def read_tree(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        D = int(file.readline().strip())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N - 1)]
    return N, D, edges

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")

def dfs(node, parent, adj_list, dp, D):
    for dist in range(1, D + 1):
        for child in adj_list[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dp[child][dist] = dp[node][dist - 1]
                dfs(child, node, adj_list, dp, D)

def solve(N, D, edges):
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for x, y in edges:
        adj_list[x].append(y)
        adj_list[y].append(x)
        
    dp = [[0] * (D + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
    dp[1][0] = 1
    
    dfs(1, -1, adj_list, dp, D)
    
    count = sum(dp[node][D] for node in range(2, N + 1) if len(adj_list[node]) == 1) % MOD
    return count

# Read the input tree
N, D, edges = read_tree('tairos.in')

# Solve the problem
result = solve(N, D, edges)

# Write the result to the output file
write_output('tairos.out', result)
```

In this rewritten solution, we use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to populate the dynamic programming table. We pass the distance information from a node to all of its children, but only if they are not the parent (to prevent cycles). For each node, we only care about the number of nodes that can be reached from it at a certain distance `dist`. Since leaves will be replaced by the entire tree, the number of nodes at distance `dist` from a leaf is the same as the number of nodes at distance `dist - 1` from the root.

Let's test this new implementation using the provided input and check if it produces the expected output of `5`.

It seems like the previous approach of using DFS and dynamic programming to propagate the counts from the root to the leaves was incorrect. My apologies for the confusion. The problem is more complex than the previous approach accounts for.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider how many times each part of the given tree will be replicated. Specifically, we should consider that leaf nodes (except for the root) will be replaced with a copy of the original tree at each step, which means that the structure of the tree will be replicated at different scales.

Here's the correct approach:
1. Compute the depth of each leaf node in the original tree.
2. For each leaf node, calculate the contribution of nodes at distance `D` by taking into account how the subtree rooted at the leaf node will be repeated at each level of replication.

We can then sum the contributions from each leaf node to get the total number of nodes at distance `D`.

Let's implement this correct approach:

```python
def read_tree(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        D = int(file.readline().strip())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N - 1)]
    return N, D, edges

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")

def dfs(node, parent, depth, adj_list, depths):
    for child in adj_list[node]:
        if child != parent:
            depths[child] = depth + 1
            dfs(child, node, depth + 1, adj_list, depths)

def solve(N, D, edges):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for x, y in edges:
        adj_list[x].append(y)
        adj_list[y].append(x)

    # Compute the depth of each node
    depths = [0] * (N + 1)
    dfs(1, -1, 0, adj_list, depths)

    count = 0
    for node in range(2, N + 1):
        if len(adj_list[node]) == 1:  # Leaf node
            leaf_depth = depths[node]
            if D % leaf_depth == 0:
                # Calculate how many times the base tree is repeated to contribute to distance D
                reps = D // leaf_depth
                # Each repetition contributes once at that depth, so we add reps to the count
                count = (count + reps) % MOD

    return count

# Read the input tree
N, D, edges = read_tree('tairos.in')

# Solve the problem
result = solve(N, D, edges)

# Write the result to the output file
write_output('tairos.out', result)
```

This solution calculates the depth of each leaf node, and for each leaf node, it calculates how many times the initial tree structure contributes nodes at distance `D`. It then sums these contributions to get the total number of nodes at the given distance. We will test this implementation with the given input and check for the correct output.
