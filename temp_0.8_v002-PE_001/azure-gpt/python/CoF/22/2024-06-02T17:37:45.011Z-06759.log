Apologies for the oversight. Since the use of numpy is not allowed within this execution environment, I will rewrite the solution using only standard Python libraries, while still optimizing for efficiency. Here is the revised solution without the numpy library:

```python
# markdown code block for Python solution

# Read data from 'tairos.in'
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as f:
    N, D = map(int, f.readline().split())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f.readlines()]

# Initialize adjacency list and degree counters
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
degrees = [0] * (N + 1)

# Populate adjacency list and degree counters
for x, y in edges:
    adj_list[x].append(y)
    adj_list[y].append(x)
    degrees[x] += 1
    degrees[y] += 1

# Use dynamic programming to count nodes at distance D
# dp[i][d] will store the number of nodes at distance d in the subtree rooted at i
dp = [[0] * (D + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
dp[1][0] = 1  # Root node at distance 0

# Function to run DFS and populate dp table
def dfs(node, parent):
    for child in adj_list[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(child, node)
            for d in range(D):
                dp[node][d + 1] += dp[child][d]
                dp[node][d + 1] %= MOD

# Constant for modulo operation
MOD = 1000000007

dfs(1, -1)

# Calculate the total number of nodes at distance D
total = 0
for d in range(D + 1):
    # Only count leaf nodes (degree 1) at distance D - d from the root
    # Multiplied by the number of nodes at distance d in the original tree
    if degrees[1] == 1 and d == D:
        total += 1  # Root is a leaf and at distance D
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        if degrees[i] == 1:
            total += dp[1][d] * dp[i][D - d]
            total %= MOD

# Write the result to 'tairos.out'
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(total))
```

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the original tree and compute, for each node, the number of nodes at each possible distance in its subtree. It then combines these counts to determine the total number of nodes at distance D in the infinite tree. The implementation avoids using large arrays when unnecessary and performs modulo operations to stay within the memory limits.

The error message indicates that the program is expecting two values from `f.readline().split()` but only got one. This means that the input file `tairos.in` likely has the number of nodes `N` on one line and the distance `D` on a separate line, rather than on the same line as the program expects.

To fix the program, I will adjust the reading operation to first read `N` and then `D` from consecutive lines:

```python
# markdown code block for Python solution

# Constants
MOD = 1000000007

# Read data from 'tairos.in'
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    D = int(f.readline().strip())
    edges = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize adjacency list
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Populate adjacency list
for x, y in edges:
    adj_list[x].append(y)
    adj_list[y].append(x)

# Use dynamic programming to count nodes at distance D
dp = [[0] * (D + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
dp[1][0] = 1

# Function to run DFS and populate dp table
def dfs(node, parent, depth):
    if depth < D:
        dp[node][depth] = dp[parent][depth - 1] if depth > 0 else 1
        for child in adj_list[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dfs(child, node, depth + 1)
dfs(1, 0, 0)

# Count the number of nodes at distance D
count = sum(dp[i][D] for i in range(1, N + 1)) % MOD

# Write the result to 'tairos.out'
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(count))
```

This solution first reads `N` and `D` from separate lines as required, then proceeds to read the edges of the tree. The DFS function now also tracks the current depth and updates the `dp` table accordingly to count the number of nodes at each distance from the root. The count of nodes at distance `D` is then summed up and written to the output file `tairos.out`.

The provided solution failed to produce the expected result because it did not correctly implement the mechanism of expanding the tree at leaves and counting the nodes at a specified distance `D` from the root. Instead, it only counted the nodes in the original tree at distance `D`, failing to account for the repetitive structure that occurs due to the specified transformation.

In the revised solution, we need to properly account for the repetitive expansion of the tree at leaves.

Here's the correct approach:

1. We count the number of leaves from the root at each distance less than `D`, as after the expansion, these leaves will have an entire subtree (a replica of the original tree) attached to them.
2. We calculate how many times each subtree contributes to the nodes at distance `D`.
3. We sum up these contributions for all leaves.

Let's reimplement the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
# markdown code block for Python solution

# Constants
MOD = 1000000007

# Read data from 'tairos.in'
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    D = int(f.readline().strip())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize adjacency list and leaf counters
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
leaf_count = [0] * (D + 1)  # To count leaves at each level

# Populate adjacency list
for x, y in edges:
    adj_list[x].append(y)
    adj_list[y].append(x)

# Function to run DFS and count leaves
def dfs(node, parent, depth):
    if len(adj_list[node]) == 1 and node != 1:  # It's a leaf if degree is 1 and it's not the root
        if depth <= D:
            leaf_count[depth] += 1
        return
    if depth < D:
        for child in adj_list[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dfs(child, node, depth + 1)

dfs(1, 0, 0)

# Count the number of nodes at distance D
# For each leaf at distance less than D, count how many new nodes will be at distance D after expansion
result = leaf_count[D]
for i in range(1, D):
    result += leaf_count[i] * leaf_count[D - i]
    result %= MOD

# Write the result to 'tairos.out'
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result))
```

In this solution, we first use a DFS from the root to find all leaves at each depth up to `D`. Then, we calculate how many nodes at distance `D` can be reached by combining the paths through the leaves found at each depth. Finally, we write the result modulo `MOD` to the output file `tairos.out`.

The provided solution counts nodes at distance `D` incorrectly because it only counts the number of leaves at each level and attempts to combine them naively. The challenge requires a more complex calculation that takes into account the structure of the tree and the recursive expansion at each leaf.

The correct approach is to first perform a DFS traversal to calculate the number of leaf nodes (`degree == 1`) for each depth level up to `D`. Then, for each level, calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` by considering the recursive structure of the tree.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# markdown code block for Python solution

MOD = 1000000007

# Read data from 'tairos.in'
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    D = int(f.readline().strip())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize adjacency list and degree counts
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
degrees = [0] * (N + 1)

# Populate adjacency list and degree counts
for x, y in edges:
    adj_list[x].append(y)
    adj_list[y].append(x)
    degrees[x] += 1
    degrees[y] += 1

# Function to run DFS and calculate the number of nodes at each depth
def dfs(node, parent, depth, nodes_at_depth):
    if depth > D:
        return
    if degrees[node] == 1 and node != 1:  # It's a leaf
        nodes_at_depth[depth] += 1
        return
    for child in adj_list[node]:
        if child != parent:
            dfs(child, node, depth + 1, nodes_at_depth)

# Initialize list to store the number of leaves at each depth
nodes_at_depth = [0] * (D + 1)
dfs(1, -1, 0, nodes_at_depth)

# Calculate the total number of nodes at distance D
result = 0
for depth in range(D + 1):
    if depth == D:
        # Add the leaves that are exactly at distance D
        result += nodes_at_depth[depth]
    else:
        # Leaves at a smaller depth contribute their subtree nodes
        # that are at the remaining distance to reach D
        result += nodes_at_depth[depth] * nodes_at_depth[D - depth]
    result %= MOD

# Write the result to 'tairos.out'
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result))
```

This solution correctly takes into account the recursive expansion of the tree and the distribution of nodes at different depths. It calculates the number of nodes at distance `D` by considering the subtrees that get attached to the leaves at each depth level during the expansion. The final result is written to the file `tairos.out`.

The previous implementations didn't correctly handle the recursive nature of the problem, and they did not accurately calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinitely expanded tree. 

The correct approach involves recognizing that the expansion of the tree at its leaves creates a fractal-like pattern that repeats the initial structure of the tree. When we count the number of nodes at distance `D`, we need to take into account the following:

1. The number of nodes at a given distance `D` in the original tree.
2. The contributions of each leaf node's repeated structures.

Here's a fixed and optimized solution using dynamic programming to count the nodes at distance `D`:

```python
# markdown code block for Python solution

# Constants
MOD = 1000000007

# Read data from 'tairos.in'
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    D = int(f.readline().strip())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in f]

# Initialize adjacency list and nodes at depth
adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(1, N + 1)}
nodes_at_depth = [0] * (D + 1)

# Populate adjacency list
for x, y in edges:
    adj_list[x].append(y)
    adj_list[y].append(x)

# Function to run DFS and count nodes at each depth
def dfs(node, depth):
    if depth > D:
        return
    nodes_at_depth[depth] += 1
    for child in adj_list[node]:
        if child != parent[node]:
            parent[child] = node
            dfs(child, depth + 1)

parent = {1: None}
dfs(1, 0)

# Calculate number of nodes at distance D
answer = nodes_at_depth[D]

# For leaves at depth < D, consider the full expansion of the tree
for depth in range(1, D):
    if len(adj_list[depth]) == 1:  # It's a leaf if degree is 1
        answer += nodes_at_depth[depth] * nodes_at_depth[D - depth]
        answer %= MOD

# Write the result to 'tairos.out'
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(answer))
```

In the fixed solution, we perform a DFS to count the number of nodes at each depth from the root up to distance `D`. We then calculate the number of nodes at distance `D` from the root, including contributions from each leaf node's subtree.

This solution applies the recursive nature of the problem correctly and ensures that we don't exceed the memory limit by using arrays of size `D + 1`. The final count of nodes at distance `D` is written to the file `tairos.out`.

The previous attempts to solve the problem have not accurately captured the recursive nature of the tree expansion. Here's the new strategy:

1. We need to run a DFS from the root to determine the depth of each node in the initial tree.
2. We need to count the number of leaf nodes at each depth level.
3. We'll determine the number of nodes at distance D using a combination of the counts from step 2 and the depth information from step 1.

Let's implement the new solution.

```python
# markdown code block for Python solution

# Constants
MOD = 1000000007

# Function to run DFS and count nodes at each depth
def dfs(node, depth, adj_list, depth_count, visited):
    visited[node] = True
    if depth <= D:
        depth_count[depth] += 1
    for child in adj_list[node]:
        if not visited[child]:
            dfs(child, depth + 1, adj_list, depth_count, visited)

# Read data from 'tairos.in'
with open('tairos.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    D = int(f.readline().strip())
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for _ in range(N - 1):
        x, y = map(int, f.readline().strip().split())
        adj_list[x].append(y)
        adj_list[y].append(x)

# Initialize depth_count to store the number of nodes at each depth
depth_count = [0 for _ in range(D + 1)]

# Run DFS from the root
visited = [False] * (N + 1)
dfs(1, 0, adj_list, depth_count, visited)

# Calculate the number of nodes at distance D in the infinite tree
result = 0
for depth in range(D + 1):
    # If the current depth is exactly D, add the number of nodes at this depth
    if depth == D:
        result += depth_count[depth]
    else:
        # For nodes at depth less than D, each contributes a subtree of height (D - depth)
        # The number of leaf nodes at depth `depth` contribute to nodes at distance D
        leaf_nodes = depth_count[depth] - sum(depth_count[depth+1:depth+2])
        additional_nodes = leaf_nodes * (depth_count[D - depth] if D - depth < N else 1)
        result += additional_nodes
    result %= MOD

# Write the result to 'tairos.out'
with open('tairos.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result))
```

In this corrected solution, we run a depth-first search to calculate the number of nodes at each depth level, up to `D`. Specifically, for each depth less than `D`, the number of leaf nodes at that depth will contribute a number of nodes equal to the number of nodes at the depth `D - depth` in the original tree. After that, we calculate the result considering the contribution of these leaf nodes and write it to the output file `tairos.out`. This approach should give us the correct number of nodes at distance `D` from the root in the infinite tree.
