Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

---

Să considerăm următorul şir:

`a`$,$ `b`$,$ `ba`$,$ `bab`$,$ `babba`$,$ `babbabab`$, \dots$

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine care este cel de-al $n$-lea termen al şirului

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `sir.in` conţine o singură linie pe care se află numărul natural $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `sir.out` va conţine o singură linie pe care se află al $n$-lea termen din şir

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 20$;

Example:
`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
bab
```
