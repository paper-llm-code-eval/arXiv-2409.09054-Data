La Loteria Națională există $N$ bile inscripționate cu numere naturale, nenule, distincte de cel mult $4$ cifre. Șeful de la loterie primește o cutie în care se află cele $6$ bile extrase la ultima rundă, restul bilelor neextrase fiind puse într-un seif. Deoarece are o fire poznașă, el scoate din cutie bila pe care este înscris numărul cel mai mic și o păstrează în buzunarul hainei sale. În locul ei va pune o bilă neextrasă, aflată în seif, având numărul cel mai apropiat de aceasta. Apoi continuă operația și scoate din cutie și bila pe care este înscris numărul maxim extras inițial, pe care o va pune în celălalt buzunar al său. De asemenea o va înlocui cu o altă bilă neextrasă inițial, aflată în seif, având numărul cel mai apropiat de aceasta.

# Cerință

Realizați un program care afișează în ordine crescătoare numerele de pe bilele aflate în cutie după modificările făcute de șef.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `loto.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, pe a doua linie cele $N$ numere naturale scrise pe bile, iar pe a treia linie cele $6$ numere naturale scrise pe bilele extrase de angajații loteriei. Valorile scrise pe aceeași linie sunt separate prin spații.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `loto.out` se vor afișa pe prima linie, separate prin câte un spațiu, cele $6$ numere obținute în cutie după modificărie făcute de șef, în ordine crescătoare.

# Restricții și precizări

* $8 < N < 1 \ 000$
* Dacă o bilă poate fi înlocuită cu două bile la fel de apropiate de ea, atunci aceasta se va înlocui cu bila având numărul mai mare.
* Pentru datele de test, atât bila cu numărul cel mai mic, cât și bila cu numărul cel mai mare pot fi înlocuite cu alte bile.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read data from file
with open('loto.in', 'r') as fin:
    lines = fin.readlines()
    N = int(lines[0].strip())
    all_numbers = np.array(list(map(int, lines[1].strip().split())), dtype=int)
    drawn_numbers = np.array(list(map(int, lines[2].strip().split())), dtype=int)

# Sort all numbers and drawn numbers
all_numbers.sort()
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Find the minimum and maximum drawn numbers
min_drawn = drawn_numbers[0]
max_drawn = drawn_numbers[-1]

# Get the numbers that were not drawn
not_drawn_numbers = np.setdiff1d(all_numbers, drawn_numbers, assume_unique=True)

# Find the closest larger or equal number to the minimum drawn number
min_replacement = not_drawn_numbers[not_drawn_numbers >= min_drawn][0]

# Find the closest smaller or equal number to the maximum drawn number
max_replacement = not_drawn_numbers[not_drawn_numbers <= max_drawn][-1]

# Replace the minimum and maximum drawn numbers with their replacements
drawn_numbers[0] = min_replacement
drawn_numbers[-1] = max_replacement

# Sort the updated list of drawn numbers
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Write the result to the output file
with open('loto.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, drawn_numbers)))
```

This solution uses numpy to efficiently handle the array operations and minimize memory usage. It reads the input from `loto.in`, performs the necessary operations, and writes the output to `loto.out`. It handles the replacement of the minimum and maximum drawn numbers by first sorting the drawn numbers and then finding the closest numbers that were not drawn. The drawn numbers are replaced and sorted again before writing to the output file.

The exit code indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment. Since the use of external libraries is limited by the system's environment and the memory constraints, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other external library.

Here's the updated solution that only uses standard Python data structures and algorithms:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('loto.in', 'r') as fin:
    N = int(next(fin).strip())
    all_numbers = list(map(int, next(fin).strip().split()))
    drawn_numbers = list(map(int, next(fin).strip().split()))

# Sort all numbers and drawn numbers
all_numbers.sort()
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Find the minimum and maximum drawn numbers
min_drawn = drawn_numbers[0]
max_drawn = drawn_numbers[-1]

# Get the numbers that were not drawn
not_drawn_numbers = sorted(set(all_numbers) - set(drawn_numbers))

# Find the closest larger or equal number to the minimum drawn number
min_replacement = min((x for x in not_drawn_numbers if x >= min_drawn), default=min_drawn)

# Find the closest smaller or equal number to the maximum drawn number
max_replacement = max((x for x in not_drawn_numbers if x <= max_drawn), default=max_drawn)

# Replace the minimum and maximum drawn numbers with their replacements
drawn_numbers[0] = min_replacement
drawn_numbers[-1] = max_replacement

# Sort the updated list of drawn numbers
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Write the result to the output file
with open('loto.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, drawn_numbers)) + '\n')
```

This solution should work within the constraints of the provided environment and follows the problem statement's requirement of not using external libraries. It uses list comprehensions, sets, and the built-in `min` and `max` functions with generators to find the closest replacements for the minimum and maximum drawn numbers. The solution reads from `loto.in` and writes the output to `loto.out`, without using `input()` or `print()`.

The output differs from the expected output because my previous solution incorrectly identifies the closest number greater than or equal to the minimum drawn number and the closest number smaller than or equal to the maximum drawn number. The logic for finding the replacements should be:

1. If there is a number in the `not_drawn_numbers` that is greater than or equal to the `min_drawn`, pick the smallest such number.
2. If there is a number in the `not_drawn_numbers` that is smaller than or equal to the `max_drawn`, pick the largest such number.

From the expected output, it is evident that the replacements should be the closest numbers from the `not_drawn_numbers` that are not already in the drawn numbers, while still adhering to the conditions of being the smallest number greater than the minimum drawn number and the largest number smaller than the maximum drawn number.

Let's fix the algorithm with the correct logic:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('loto.in', 'r') as fin:
    N = int(next(fin).strip())
    all_numbers = list(map(int, next(fin).strip().split()))
    drawn_numbers = list(map(int, next(fin).strip().split()))

# Sort drawn numbers
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Get the minimum and maximum drawn numbers
min_drawn = drawn_numbers[0]
max_drawn = drawn_numbers[-1]

# Exclude the drawn numbers from all_numbers to get the not_drawn_numbers
not_drawn_numbers = sorted(set(all_numbers) - set(drawn_numbers))

# Find the closest number greater than or equal to min_drawn
for num in not_drawn_numbers:
    if num > min_drawn:
        min_replacement = num
        break
else:
    min_replacement = min_drawn

# Find the closest number smaller than or equal to max_drawn
for num in reversed(not_drawn_numbers):
    if num < max_drawn:
        max_replacement = num
        break
else:
    max_replacement = max_drawn

# Replace the minimum and maximum drawn numbers with their replacements
drawn_numbers[0] = min_replacement
drawn_numbers[-1] = max_replacement

# Sort the updated list of drawn numbers
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Write the result to the output file
with open('loto.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, drawn_numbers)) + '\n')
```

This revised solution starts by reading the input and sorting the list of drawn numbers, then it finds the minimum and maximum drawn numbers. It then determines the `not_drawn_numbers` by subtracting the set of drawn numbers from the set of all numbers. The algorithm finds the closest greater number than `min_drawn` and the closest smaller number than `max_drawn` by iterating over the sorted `not_drawn_numbers`. These replacements are then used to replace the minimum and maximum in the `drawn_numbers`, the list is sorted again, and the result is written to the output file.

Upon re-evaluating the differences between the expected and the found result, I can see that the logic for finding the replacements for the minimum and maximum drawn numbers was still incorrect. Here is what went wrong with the previous solution:

1. For the minimum drawn number (2 in this case), the solution incorrectly finds the smallest number greater than the minimum drawn number in the `not_drawn_numbers` list. However, the expected behavior is to replace the smallest drawn number with the smallest number greater than or equal to it from the `not_drawn_numbers` which is actually 1, not 7.
2. For the maximum drawn number (22 in this case), the solution is also incorrect: it finds the largest number smaller than the maximum drawn number in the `not_drawn_numbers` list. The correct behavior is to replace the largest drawn number with the largest number smaller than or equal to it from the `not_drawn_numbers` which is 26, not 18.

Let's correct the solution:
```python
# Read data from file
with open('loto.in', 'r') as fin:
    N = int(next(fin).strip())
    all_numbers = list(map(int, next(fin).strip().split()))
    drawn_numbers = list(map(int, next(fin).strip().split()))

# Sort the all_numbers and drawn_numbers
all_numbers.sort()
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Find the minimum and maximum drawn numbers
min_drawn = drawn_numbers[0]
max_drawn = drawn_numbers[-1]

# Get the numbers that were not drawn
not_drawn_numbers = [num for num in all_numbers if num not in drawn_numbers]

# Find the closest number greater than or equal to min_drawn
min_index = 0
for num in not_drawn_numbers:
    if num >= min_drawn:
        min_replacement = num
        break
    min_index += 1

# Remove the min_replacement from not_drawn_numbers to avoid picking it again
if min_index < len(not_drawn_numbers):
    not_drawn_numbers.pop(min_index)

# Find the closest number smaller than or equal to max_drawn
max_index = len(not_drawn_numbers) - 1
for num in reversed(not_drawn_numbers):
    if num <= max_drawn:
        max_replacement = num
        break
    max_index -= 1

# Replace the minimum and maximum drawn numbers with their replacements
drawn_numbers[0] = min_replacement
drawn_numbers[-1] = max_replacement

# Sort the updated list of drawn numbers
drawn_numbers.sort()

# Write the result to the output file
with open('loto.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, drawn_numbers)) + '\n')
```

The correct logic has been implemented to find the closest number greater than or equal to the minimum drawn number and the closest number smaller than or equal to the maximum drawn number. It also takes care of the case where a number could be a potential replacement for both minimum and maximum drawn numbers by removing the `min_replacement` from the `not_drawn_numbers` list before finding the `max_replacement`. This solution should match the expected output.
