Gigel are o panglică alcătuită din benzi de $1 cm$ lăţime, colorate în diverse culori. Panglica are $N$ benzi, fiecare colorată cu una din $C$ culori, culori pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $C$. Gigel vrea ca la ambele capete ale panglicii să aibă aceeaşi culoare, dar cum nu poate schimba culorile benzilor, singura posibilitate rămâne tăierea unor bucăţi de la capete. 

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine modul de tăiere a panglicii astfel încât la cele două capete să fie benzi de aceeaşi culoare, iar lungimea panglicii obţinute să fie maximă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `panglica.in` conţine:

- pe prima linie numerele naturale $N$ şi $C$ separate printr-un spaţiu;
- pe următoarele $N$ linii descrierea panglicii: pe fiecare linie un număr natural de la $1$ la $C$, reprezentând în ordine culorile fâşiilor ce alcătuiesc panglica.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `panglica.out` va conţine următoarele $4$ numere:

- pe prima linie numărul de fâşii rămase;
- pe linia a doua numărul culorii care se află la capete;
- pe linia a treia câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la începutul panglicii iniţiale;
- pe linia a patra câte fâşii trebuie tăiate de la sfârşitul panglicii iniţiale

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq C \leq 200$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii alegeţi pe cea în care se taie cât mai puţin din partea de început a panglicii.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Reading data from panglica.in
with open('panglica.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    N, C = map(int, lines[0].split())
    colors = np.array([int(line.strip()) for line in lines[1:]], dtype=np.int32)

# Initialize variables to store the result
max_length = 0
color_at_ends = 0
cut_from_start = 0
cut_from_end = 0

# Calculate the lengths of same-colored segments at the start and end
start_lengths = np.zeros(C + 1, dtype=np.int32)
end_lengths = np.zeros(C + 1, dtype=np.int32)
current_color = colors[0]
length = 1

for color in colors[1:]:
    if color == current_color:
        length += 1
    else:
        break
start_lengths[current_color] = length

current_color = colors[-1]
length = 1

for color in reversed(colors[:-1]):
    if color == current_color:
        length += 1
    else:
        break
end_lengths[current_color] = length

# Calculate the lengths of same-colored segments in the middle
for color_index in range(1, C + 1):
    length = start_lengths[color_index] + end_lengths[color_index]
    if length > max_length:
        max_length = length
        color_at_ends = color_index
        cut_from_start = 0
        cut_from_end = N - max_length

# Checking for color sequences starting in the middle and reaching the ends
for i in range(start_lengths[color_at_ends], N - end_lengths[color_at_ends]):
    if colors[i] == color_at_ends:
        length = 1
        for j in range(i + 1, N - end_lengths[color_at_ends]):
            if colors[j] == color_at_ends:
                length += 1
            else:
                break

        for j in range(i - 1, start_lengths[color_at_ends] - 1, -1):
            if colors[j] == color_at_ends:
                length += 1
            else:
                break

        if length > max_length:
            max_length = length
            cut_from_start = i - start_lengths[color_at_ends]
            cut_from_end = N - (i + length)

# Writing the result to panglica.out
with open('panglica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_length}\n{color_at_ends}\n{cut_from_start}\n{cut_from_end}\n")
```

This solution iterates through the array to find the longest segment of the same color extending from one end or both ends and calculates the number of cuts needed at the beginning and the end of the ribbon. It makes use of numpy to handle the input data efficiently and minimizes memory overhead by using integer arrays and simple control structures. It also ensures that the solution is written to `panglica.out` without using print statements, adhering to the memory constraints provided.

It appears that the program has exited with an error because the `numpy` module is not available. In a constrained environment where certain libraries such as `numpy` cannot be installed or are not allowed due to memory restrictions, we have to rely on standard Python data structures and libraries.

I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other external libraries, making sure to minimize memory usage.

```python
# Reading data from panglica.in
with open('panglica.in', 'r') as file:
    N, C = map(int, file.readline().split())
    colors = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(N)]

# Initialize variables to store the result
max_length = 0
color_at_ends = 0
cut_from_start = 0

# We use the list colors to store the sequence of colors efficiently.
# Instead of storing start and end lengths, we can directly iterate through the colors array.
# Find the longest same-color segment starting from one end
for i in range(N):
    if i > 0 and colors[i] != colors[i-1]:
        break
    j = N - 1
    while j >= i and colors[j] == colors[i]:
        j -= 1
    length = (i + 1) + (N - 1 - j)
    if length > max_length:
        max_length = length
        color_at_ends = colors[i]
        cut_from_start = i

# Find the longest same-color segment starting from the other end
for i in reversed(range(N)):
    if i < N - 1 and colors[i] != colors[i+1]:
        break
    j = 0
    while j <= i and colors[j] == colors[i]:
        j += 1
    length = (i - j + 1) + j
    if length > max_length or (length == max_length and j < cut_from_start):
        max_length = length
        color_at_ends = colors[i]
        cut_from_start = j

# Calculate how many slices need to be cut from the end
cut_from_end = N - max_length - cut_from_start

# Writing the result to panglica.out
with open('panglica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_length}\n{color_at_ends}\n{cut_from_start}\n{cut_from_end}\n")
```

This solution uses only built-in Python features and should work within the 8MB memory limit. It reads from `panglica.in` and writes to `panglica.out` without using `numpy`, and it avoids using any large data structures or unnecessary memory allocations. The logic of the program remains the same, identifying the longest segment of the ribbon with the same color at both ends and calculating the necessary cuts accordingly.

The results differ because the current solution does not correctly find the longest segment where both ends have the same color. The solution was only checking for longest segments starting from the very beginning or the very end, but it didn't consider that the longest segment could start and end somewhere in the middle.

To fix this, we need to modify the algorithm to check for segments that have the same color at both ends but possibly start after the beginning of the ribbon and end before the end of the ribbon. Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Read data from panglica.in
with open('panglica.in', 'r') as file:
    N, C = map(int, file.readline().split())
    colors = []
    for _ in range(N):
        color = int(file.readline().strip())
        colors.append(color)

# Initialize variables to store the result
max_length = 0
color_at_ends = 0
cut_from_start = 0
cut_from_end = 0

# Use dictionaries to store the first and last occurrence of each color
first_occurrence = {}
last_occurrence = {}

# Compute first and last occurrences of each color
for i, color in enumerate(colors):
    if color not in first_occurrence:
        first_occurrence[color] = i
    last_occurrence[color] = i

# Check for the longest segment with the same color at both ends
for color in range(1, C + 1):
    if color in first_occurrence and color in last_occurrence:
        length = last_occurrence[color] - first_occurrence[color] + 1
        if length > max_length:
            max_length = length
            color_at_ends = color
            cut_from_start = first_occurrence[color]
            cut_from_end = N - last_occurrence[color] - 1
        # If lengths are the same choose the one with fewer cuts at the start
        elif length == max_length and first_occurrence[color] < cut_from_start:
            max_length = length
            color_at_ends = color
            cut_from_start = first_occurrence[color]
            cut_from_end = N - last_occurrence[color] - 1

# Write the result to panglica.out
with open('panglica.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_length}\n{color_at_ends}\n{cut_from_start}\n{cut_from_end}\n")
```

This solution first calculates the first and last occurrence of each color. Then, it iterates over each color to determine if there is a segment with the same color at both ends. If it finds such a segment, it checks if this is the longest one found so far and updates the variables accordingly. This solution should produce the expected output.
