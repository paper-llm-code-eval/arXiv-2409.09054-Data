Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `ech.in` and write to `ech.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Numim _număr echilibrat_ un număr natural pentru care suma cifrelor de pe poziții pare este egală cu suma cifrelor de pe poziții impare.
De exemplu numărul $13552$ este _echilibrat_, pentru că $1+5+2=8=3+5$.

# Cerință

Dat fiind un număr natural $N$ să se determine cel mai mic _număr echilibrat_, strict mai mare decât $N$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `ech.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ech.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris cel mai mic _număr echilibrat_, strict mai mare decât $N$.

# Restricții și precizări

* Numărul $N$ are cel mult $23$ de cifre.
* Pentru teste valorând $40\%$ din punctaj, $N$ are cel mult $18$ cifre.

Example:
`ech.in`
```
99
```

`ech.out`
```
110

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def is_balanced(number):
    # Convert the number into a string and then an array of digits
    digits = np.array([int(digit) for digit in str(number)])
    # Determine the position indices
    even_indices = np.arange(0, len(digits), 2)
    odd_indices = np.arange(1, len(digits), 2)
    # Sum up the digits on even and odd positions
    even_sum = np.sum(digits[even_indices])
    odd_sum = np.sum(digits[odd_indices])
    return even_sum == odd_sum

def next_balanced(N):
    # Start searching from the next number
    number = N + 1
    # Continue the search until we find a balanced number
    while not is_balanced(number):
        number += 1
    return number

def main():
    # Read the input from the file
    with open('ech.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())

    # Get the next balanced number
    balanced_number = next_balanced(N)

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('ech.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(balanced_number))

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code should work given the restrictions mentioned in the problem, but in order to fully optimize for memory usage, we might need to avoid creating unnecessary arrays or using numpy, as even a single import of numpy can exceed the 8MB memory limit.
Please note that this solution may still not be the most memory-efficient given the constraint, but it provides the general structure of reading from and writing to files specified, and it can be further optimized to reduce memory consumption.

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

It seems that the environment where the code is running does not have the `numpy` library installed, which is causing the `ModuleNotFoundError`. To comply with the memory constraint and avoid relying on external libraries, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other third-party library.

Let's implement a solution that calculates the balance directly without the use of `numpy`:

```python
def is_balanced(number):
    digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(number)]
    even_sum = sum(digits[0::2])  # Sum of digits at even indices
    odd_sum = sum(digits[1::2])   # Sum of digits at odd indices
    return even_sum == odd_sum

def next_balanced(N):
    number = N + 1
    while not is_balanced(number):
        number += 1
    return number

def main():
    with open('ech.in', 'r') as file:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())

    balanced_number = next_balanced(N)

    with open('ech.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(balanced_number))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should work under the memory constraint since it does not import any additional libraries beyond the standard Python libraries, thus minimizing the memory footprint. Additionally, list comprehensions and string operations are used instead of `numpy` arrays to check for number balance and find the next balanced number.
