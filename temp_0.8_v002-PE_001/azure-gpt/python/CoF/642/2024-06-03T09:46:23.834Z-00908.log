Definim un număr ***liber de pătrate*** ca fiind un număr natural care nu are ca divizor niciun pătrat perfect mai mare ca $1$. Prin convenție, $1$ este considerat *liber de pătrate*.

Așadar, șirul numerelor *libere de pătrate* este: $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, \dots$

Se consideră un șir de $N$ numere naturale $X_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, unde $N$ este un număr natural.

Definim o ***bisecvență*** ca un subșir nevid obținut prin eliminarea dintr-o secvență a unui număr care nu este la începutul sau la sfârșitul secvenței.

# Cerințe
1) Să se determine câte numere *libere de pătrate* conține șirul dat.
2) Să se determine cea mai lungă *bisecvență* din șir formată din numere *libere de pătrate*, obținută prin eliminarea unui număr care **nu** este *liber de pătrate*.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `oneout.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$, reprezentând cerința, pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$ iar pe a treia linie $N$ numere naturale, separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația de mai sus.

# Date de ieșire
Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, în fișierul de ieșire `oneout.out` se va scrie numărul de numere *libere de pătrate* din șir.

Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$:
- Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `oneout.out` se vor scrie două numere $L$ și $K$ despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $L$ reprezintă lungimea maximă a unei *bisecvențe* cu proprietățile cerute, iar $K$ reprezintă numărul de *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă existente în șir.
- Pe următoarele $K$ linii se vor scrie indicii de început și de sfârșit ai fiecărei *bisecvențe* de lungime maximă găsite, în ordinea crescătoare a indicelui de start, despărțite printr-un spațiu.
- Dacă șirul nu conține nicio *bisecvență* cu proprietățile cerute, în fișierul de ieșire se va scrie `-1`.

# Restricții și precizări
- $3 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $2 \leq X_i \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq i \leq N$
- Lungimea unei *bisecvențe* reprezintă numărul de numere din aceasta.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 37 de puncte $C = 1$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 24 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 25$.
- Pentru teste în valoare de 63 de puncte $C = 2$, din care pentru teste în valoare de 23 de puncte $3 \leq N \leq 101$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# To solve the challenge, we will use numpy to handle large arrays efficiently
import numpy as np

# Function to check if a number is free of squares
def is_free_of_squares(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(np.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (i * i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to find all free-of-squares numbers in a range
def all_free_of_squares(max_value):
    is_free = np.ones(max_value + 1, dtype=bool)
    is_free[0] = is_free[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(np.sqrt(max_value)) + 1):
        if is_free[i]:
            is_free[i*i:max_value+1:i*i] = False
    return is_free

# Read data from file
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:

    X = np.array(file.readline().strip().split(), dtype=int)

# Precompute free-of-squares numbers up to the maximum possible value
max_val = 10**6
free_of_squares = all_free_of_squares(max_val)

# Solution for task 1
if C == 1:
    # Count the free-of-squares numbers in the array
    count = np.sum(free_of_squares[X])
    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count))

# Solution for task 2
elif C == 2:
    # Mark elements in the array as free-of-squares or not
    is_free_array = free_of_squares[X]
    # Find the longest subsequence of free-of-squares numbers
    longest_length = 0
    longest_count = 0
    sequences = []

    # Iterate over the array and find all such subsequences
    start = 0
    for i in range(1, N - 1):
        if not is_free_array[i]:  # Non free-of-square number is a candidate for removal
            length = np.sum(is_free_array[start:i]) + np.sum(is_free_array[i+1:])
            if length > longest_length:
                longest_length = length
                longest_count = 1
                sequences = [(start, i)]
            elif length == longest_length:
                longest_count += 1
                sequences.append((start, i))
            start = i + 1

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        if longest_count == 0:
            file.write('-1')
        else:
            file.write(f'{longest_length} {longest_count}\n')
            for seq in sequences:
                file.write(f'{seq[0] + 1} {seq[1] + 1}\n')
```

This is a memory-efficient solution that uses numpy to manage memory usage efficiently, especially for large arrays. It precomputes which numbers are free of squares up to the maximum value in the array and then applies this knowledge to the tasks at hand. The solution avoids using `input()` or `print()` for IO operations, and instead, reads and writes to the files directly.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. In many programming challenges or restricted environments, external libraries like `numpy` might not be allowed or available. We need to implement the solution using only the standard Python library, which requires careful memory management due to the memory limit of ~8MB.

Given these constraints, I will rewrite the solution using only built-in Python features, paying special attention to memory efficiency.

Here is the updated solution without using `numpy`:

```python
from math import isqrt

# Function to check if a number is free of squares
def is_free_of_squares(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, isqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % (i * i) == 0:
            return False
    return True


with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    X = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Solution for task 1
if C == 1:
    count = sum(is_free_of_squares(x) for x in X)

    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count))

# Solution for task 2
elif C == 2:
    free_of_squares = [is_free_of_squares(x) for x in X]
    longest_length = 0
    longest_count = 0
    sequences = []

    # Initialize pointers for the sequence start and end
    start = 0
    while start < N and free_of_squares[start]:
        start += 1

    for i in range(start + 1, N - 1):
        if not free_of_squares[i]:
            count = sum(free_of_squares[start:i]) + sum(free_of_squares[i + 1:])
            if count > longest_length:
                longest_length = count
                longest_count = 1
                sequences = [(start, i)]
            elif count == longest_length:
                longest_count += 1
                sequences.append((start, i))
            start = i + 1

    # Check for the last sequence after the loop
    if start < N - 1:
        count = sum(free_of_squares[start:])
        if count > longest_length:
            longest_length = count
            longest_count = 1
            sequences = [(start, N - 1)]
        elif count == longest_length:
            longest_count += 1
            sequences.append((start, N - 1))

    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        if longest_count == 0:
            file.write('-1\n')
        else:
            file.write(f'{longest_length} {longest_count}\n')
            for seq in sequences:
                file.write(f'{seq[0] + 1} {seq[1]}\n')
```

This updated solution avoids using `numpy` and relies on the standard Python library for all computations, including the square root calculation. The solution still reads from and writes to the files directly without using `input()` or `print()`. It should work within the memory constraints of the challenge.

The difference in results is due to an incorrect implementation of the logic to find the longest bisecting subsequence. The current implementation does not handle cases where multiple bisecting points exist, and it immediately starts a new search after finding a non-free-of-squares number. The logic for updating the longest sequences and the corresponding start and end indices is also incorrect.

We need a different approach to efficiently find the longest bisecting subsequences. We should iterate through the sequence only once and maintain the longest sequence length and its indices without restarting the count unnecessarily.

Here is the corrected and improved solution:

```python
from math import isqrt

# Function to check if a number is free of squares
def is_free_of_squares(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, isqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % (i * i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    X = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Solution for task 1
if C == 1:
    count = sum(is_free_of_squares(x) for x in X)

    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count) + '\n')

# Solution for task 2
elif C == 2:
    free_of_squares = [is_free_of_squares(x) for x in X]
    longest_length = 0
    longest_count = 0
    sequences = []
    current_start = 0 if free_of_squares[0] else -1
    potential_end = -1

    for i in range(1, N):
        if free_of_squares[i]:
            if current_start == -1:
                current_start = i
        else:
            if current_start != -1 and potential_end != -1:
                length = i - current_start - 1
                if length > longest_length:
                    longest_length = length
                    longest_count = 1
                    sequences = [(current_start, potential_end)]
                elif length == longest_length:
                    longest_count += 1
                    sequences.append((current_start, potential_end))
            potential_end = i
            current_start = -1 if i < N - 1 and not free_of_squares[i + 1] else i

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        if longest_length == 0:
            file.write('-1\n')
        else:
            file.write(f'{longest_length} {longest_count}\n')
            for seq in sequences:
                file.write(f'{seq[0] + 1} {seq[1]}\n')
```

This corrected solution should now correctly find the longest bisecting subsequences by maintaining the current start index and potential end index. It updates the longest sequence only when a new non-free-of-squares number is encountered and if the current sequence is longer than the previously stored longest sequence. The results should now match the expected output.

Upon reviewing the previous solution, it becomes clear that there is a misinterpretation of the problem definition for task 2. The logic for determining the start and end indices of the bisecting sequences is incorrect, and the calculation of the length of these sequences does not correctly handle the elimination of non-free-of-squares numbers.

The expected output indicates that we should be finding the longest continuous subsequence of free-of-squares numbers that can be made by removing exactly one non-free-of-squares number from the original sequence. Moreover, we should be looking for the subsequence that starts as early as possible and is as long as possible.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
from math import isqrt

# Precompute the square-free status of all numbers up to 10^6
max_value = 10**6
is_square_free = [True] * (max_value + 1)
for i in range(2, isqrt(max_value) + 1):
    square = i * i
    for j in range(square, max_value + 1, square):
        is_square_free[j] = False

# Read data from file
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    X = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Solution for task 1
if C == 1:
    count = sum(1 for x in X if is_square_free[x])

    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count) + '\n')

# Solution for task 2
elif C == 2:
    # Initialize variables to keep track of longest bisecting sequence
    longest_length = 0
    longest_start_index = -1
    current_start_index = 0

    # Convert the input numbers to their square-free status
    square_free_status = [is_square_free[x] for x in X]
    
    # Find the longest bisecting sequence
    for i in range(N):
        if not square_free_status[i]: # If the number is not square-free
            current_length = i - current_start_index
            # Check if the current sequence is longer than the longest found so far
            if current_length > longest_length:
                longest_length = current_length
                longest_start_index = current_start_index
            # Reset the start index for the next sequence
            current_start_index = i + 1

    # Check the last sequence after the loop
    if N - current_start_index > longest_length:
        longest_length = N - current_start_index
        longest_start_index = current_start_index

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        if longest_length <= 1: # No valid bisecting sequence found
            file.write('-1\n')
        else:
            # Subtract 1 from the length to account for the removed non-square-free number
            file.write(f'{longest_length - 1} 1\n')
            file.write(f'{longest_start_index + 1} {longest_start_index + longest_length - 1}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly find the longest bisecting sequence by maintaining the current start index and updating the longest sequence when a non-free-of-squares number is encountered. After the loop, we also check for the last sequence, which might be the longest if the sequence ends with free-of-squares numbers. The output should match the expected results.

The output does not match the expected output because the solution still incorrectly calculates the length of the bisecting sequences, and it does not handle the elimination of a single non-free-of-squares number properly. The logic to identify the longest bisecting sequence and to collect all possible longest sequences needs to be fixed.

According to the problem statement, we are looking for the longest subsequence of square-free numbers made by removing a single non-square-free number (if it exists) from the original sequence. Let's correct the implementation based on this understanding:

```python
# Function to check if a number is free of squares using pre-sieved prime factors
def is_free_of_squares(n, prime_factors):
    for prime in prime_factors:
        if prime * prime > n:
            break
        count = 0
        while n % prime == 0:
            n //= prime
            count += 1
            if count == 2:
                return False
    return True

# Pre-sieve prime factors up to the square root of the maximum value
def sieve_prime_factors(limit):
    prime_factors = []
    sieve = [True] * (limit + 1)
    for i in range(2, limit + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            for j in range(i * i, limit + 1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return prime_factors

# Function to find the longest bisecting sequences
def find_longest_bisecting_sequences(X, prime_factors):
    square_free = [is_free_of_squares(x, prime_factors) for x in X]
    longest_length = 0
    sequences = []
    start = 0
    for i in range(1, len(X)):
        if not square_free[i]:
            # Evaluate the length of the sequence ending before the current non-square-free number
            length = i - start
            if length > longest_length:
                longest_length = length
                sequences = [(start, i - 1)]
            elif length == longest_length:
                sequences.append((start, i - 1))
            start = i + 1
    # Check for a sequence ending at the last element
    length = len(X) - start
    if length > longest_length:
        longest_length = length
        sequences = [(start, len(X) - 1)]
    elif length == longest_length and length > 0:
        sequences.append((start, len(X) - 1))
    return longest_length, sequences

# Read data from file
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    X = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Solution for task 1
if C == 1:
    prime_factors = sieve_prime_factors(isqrt(max(X)))
    count = sum(is_free_of_squares(x, prime_factors) for x in X)
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(count) + '\n')

# Solution for task 2
elif C == 2:
    prime_factors = sieve_prime_factors(isqrt(max(X)))
    longest_length, sequences = find_longest_bisecting_sequences(X, prime_factors)
    with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
        if not sequences:
            file.write('-1\n')
        else:
            # The longest bisecting sequence length is reduced by 1 to account for the removal
            file.write(f'{longest_length - 1} {len(sequences)}\n')
            for start, end in sequences:
                # We shift the indices by 1 to match the problem's 1-based indexing
                file.write(f'{start + 1} {end + 1}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly find all longest bisecting sequences by tracking the start and end indices of sequences as we iterate through the array. It uses a sieve to precompute prime factors for checking square-freeness, which is more efficient than checking every number individually. The output should now match the expected results.

The error message indicates that `isqrt` is not defined. The `isqrt` function is available in the Python `math` module starting from Python 3.8. If we're using an earlier version of Python, `isqrt` won't be available and we have to define an alternative way to compute the integer square root.

Let's write a custom integer square root function and implement the rest of the solution correctly. Additionally, I will improve the logic to find the longest bisecting sequences by simplifying the algorithm.

Here's the corrected code:

```python

In this corrected code, `is_square_free` function is used to check whether the numbers are free of squares. For the second task, we iterate through the `X` array and keep track of the current sequence length of square-free numbers. If a non square-free number is encountered, we compare the current sequence length with the maximum length found so far and update the maximum if necessary. After the loop, we check if the last sequence is the longest one. We write `-1` to the output file if no bisecting sequence is found, otherwise, we write the start and end indices of the longest bisecting sequence.

The expected output is indicating the length of the longest bisecting subsequence possible by removing one non-square-free number and the number of such subsequences, followed by the start and end indices of these subsequences. The previous solution has a logic error in determining these subsequences, as it does not correctly account for the removal of exactly one non-square-free number.

We need to modify the approach to track sequences correctly and update the maximum length and indices while considering the one non-square-free number that can be removed. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def is_free_of_squares(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if (n // i) % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Precompute square-free status for all possible input numbers
max_num = max(X)
square_free = [False, True] + [is_free_of_squares(i) for i in range(2, max_num + 1)]

# Read data from file
with open('oneout.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    X = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize variables for the longest bisecting sequence
max_length = 0
count_max_length = 0
sequence_indices = []

# Check for the longest bisecting sequence
if C == 2:
    start = 0  # Start index of the current sequence
    last_non_square_free = -1  # Index of the last non-square-free number

    for i in range(N):
        if not square_free[X[i]]:  # Non-square-free number found
            if last_non_square_free != -1 and last_non_square_free >= start:
                # Close the current sequence before the last non-square-free number
                length = i - start - 1
                if length > max_length:
                    max_length = length
                    count_max_length = 1
                    sequence_indices = [(start, last_non_square_free)]
                elif length == max_length:
                    count_max_length += 1
                    sequence_indices.append((start, last_non_square_free))
                start = last_non_square_free + 1
            last_non_square_free = i

    # Check for a final sequence including the last number
    if last_non_square_free != -1 and last_non_square_free >= start:
        length = N - start - 1
        if length > max_length:
            max_length = length
            sequence_indices = [(start, last_non_square_free)]
        elif length == max_length:
            sequence_indices.append((start, last_non_square_free))

# Write results to the output file
with open('oneout.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        file.write(f"{sum(square_free[X[i]] for i in range(N))}\n")
    elif C == 2:
        if max_length == 0:
            file.write("-1\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{max_length} {count_max_length}\n")
            for start, end in sequence_indices:
                file.write(f"{start + 1} {end + 1}\n")  # Convert to 1-based indexing
```

This solution should now correctly find the longest bisecting subsequence by tracking the index of the last non-square-free number and ensuring we consider the removal of exactly one such number to potentially extend the sequence. When a non-square-free number is found, the code checks if it is possible to end the sequence before the last such number and potentially starts a new sequence after it. After processing the entire array, the code writes the appropriate results to the output file.
