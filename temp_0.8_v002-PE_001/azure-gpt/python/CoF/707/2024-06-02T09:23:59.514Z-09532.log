Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră următorul şir, construit astfel încât fiecare element al lui, cu excepţia primului, se obţine din cel precedent: $1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, \dots$
Termenii din şir sunt numerotaţi începând cu $1$.

# Cerință

Dat $n$, un număr natural, să se determine cel de-al $n$-lea termen din şirul dat.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găseste numarul $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se va găsi un singur număr întreg, al $n$-lea termen al sirului.

# Restricții și precizări

* $4 \leq n \leq 35$;
* numărul de cifre ale unui termen nu depăşeşte $17 \ 000$.

Example:
`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
1211
```

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Function to generate the next term in the sequence
def next_term(term):
    result = []
    prev_char = term[0]
    count = 1
    for char in term[1:]:
        if char == prev_char:
            count += 1
        else:
            result.extend([str(count), prev_char])
            prev_char = char
            count = 1
    result.extend([str(count), prev_char])
    return ''.join(result)

# Read the input
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the nth term of the sequence
sequence = '1'
for _ in range(1, n):
    sequence = next_term(sequence)

# Write the output
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(sequence)
```
```

This Python code reads a number from `sir.in`, calculates the nth term of the sequence through an iterative approach, and writes the result to `sir.out`. The `next_term` function handles the logic for creating the next term in the sequence by counting consecutive digits and forming the next term as a string.

This code avoids using unnecessary memory consumption by not storing the entire sequence but only keeping the previous term in memory and calculating the next one based on it. This should help to keep it within the memory limit imposed by the problem.

Expected program to write result to `sir.out` and read from `sir.in`.
Do not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.
