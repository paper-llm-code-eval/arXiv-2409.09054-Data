Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră următorul şir, construit astfel încât fiecare element al lui, cu excepţia primului, se obţine din cel precedent: $1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, \dots$
Termenii din şir sunt numerotaţi începând cu $1$.

# Cerință

Dat $n$, un număr natural, să se determine cel de-al $n$-lea termen din şirul dat.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găseste numarul $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se va găsi un singur număr întreg, al $n$-lea termen al sirului.

# Restricții și precizări

* $4 \leq n \leq 35$;
* numărul de cifre ale unui termen nu depăşeşte $17 \ 000$.

Example:
`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
1211
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def next_term(s):
    # Efficiently find the next term in the sequence
    counts = [[s[0], 1]]
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i-1]:
            counts[-1][1] += 1
        else:
            counts.append([s[i], 1])
    return ''.join(['{}{}'.format(count, num) for num, count in counts])

def find_nth_term(n):
    if n == 1:
        return '1'
    term = '1'
    for _ in range(1, n):
        term = next_term(term)
    return term

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the nth term
nth_term = find_nth_term(n)

# Write to sir.out
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(nth_term + '\n')
```

This solution reads `n` from the file `sir.in`, calculates the nth term of the sequence efficiently using a list to store pairs of the number and its count, and writes the nth term to the file `sir.out`.

It's important to note that this solution does not use any unnecessary memory consumption (like storing all previous terms) and should be under the memory limit specified in the task description. The computation is done step by step, and only the current and next terms are stored at any given point.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` library is not installed, which is causing the program to exit. However, in this specific task, `numpy` is not necessary as we are not performing any complex mathematical operations that would require its functionality. We can simply remove the import statement for `numpy`.

Here is the corrected code without the `numpy` import:

```python
def next_term(s):
    # Efficiently find the next term in the sequence
    counts = [[s[0], 1]]
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i-1]:
            counts[-1][1] += 1
        else:
            counts.append([s[i], 1])
    return ''.join(['{}{}'.format(count, num) for num, count in counts])

def find_nth_term(n):
    if n == 1:
        return '1'
    term = '1'
    for _ in range(1, n):
        term = next_term(term)
    return term

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the nth term
nth_term = find_nth_term(n)

# Write to sir.out
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(nth_term + '\n')
```

This solution should work correctly as it no longer attempts to import the `numpy` library. The logic for generating the nth term of the sequence remains the same, and it will write the output to `sir.out` as required.
