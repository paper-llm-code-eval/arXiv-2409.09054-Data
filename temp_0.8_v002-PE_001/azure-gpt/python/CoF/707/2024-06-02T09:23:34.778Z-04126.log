Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `sir.in` and write to `sir.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră următorul şir, construit astfel încât fiecare element al lui, cu excepţia primului, se obţine din cel precedent: $1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, \dots$
Termenii din şir sunt numerotaţi începând cu $1$.

# Cerință

Dat $n$, un număr natural, să se determine cel de-al $n$-lea termen din şirul dat.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găseste numarul $n$.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se va găsi un singur număr întreg, al $n$-lea termen al sirului.

# Restricții și precizări

* $4 \leq n \leq 35$;
* numărul de cifre ale unui termen nu depăşeşte $17 \ 000$.

Example:
`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
1211
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Required libraries
import numpy as np

# Reads the value of n from the 'sir.in' file
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())

# Function to generate the next term in the series
def next_term(term):
    # Convert the term to a numpy array for efficient computation
    term_array = np.array([int(digit) for digit in term], dtype=np.int8)
    # Find where the term's values changes
    changes = np.nonzero(np.diff(term_array))[0]
    # Append the length of the array to changes to handle the last group
    changes = np.append(changes, len(term_array) - 1)
    # Calculate the lengths of the groups of digits
    lengths = np.diff(np.append(-1, changes))
    # Take the unique digits that appear in the groups
    digits = term_array[changes]
    # Convert lengths and digits to strings and concatenate them
    result = "".join(f"{length}{digit}" for length, digit in zip(lengths, digits))
    return result

# Series generator
def generate_series(n):
    term = "1"
    for _ in range(1, n):
        term = next_term(term)
    return term

# Calculate the nth term
nth_term = generate_series(n)

# Write the nth term to the 'sir.out' file
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(nth_term + '\n')
```

This solution utilizes NumPy for efficient array manipulation, which is crucial for reducing memory usage. The approach also avoids creating unnecessary intermediate lists or strings, which helps to keep memory usage within the imposed limits.

Program exited with code 1.
stdout:
```

stderr:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    import numpy as np

Think of what has caused the exit code. Use the standard out and standard error to help you understand the issue.

The error indicates that the NumPy module is not available. Since the task requires optimizing for memory, and NumPy is not a standard library module, we need to implement the solution without using any external libraries such as NumPy.

The program exited with code 1 because it failed to import the NumPy library. This needs to be fixed by avoiding the use of NumPy and relying solely on Python's standard library.

Below is the rewritten Python code without NumPy:

```python
# Function to generate the next term in the series
def next_term(term):
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(term):
        count = 1
        while i + 1 < len(term) and term[i] == term[i + 1]:
            i += 1
            count += 1
        result.append(str(count))
        result.append(term[i])
        i += 1
    return ''.join(result)

# Series generator
def generate_series(n):
    term = "1"
    for _ in range(1, n):
        term = next_term(term)
    return term

# Reads the value of n from the 'sir.in' file
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n = int(file_in.readline().strip())

# Calculate the nth term
nth_term = generate_series(n)

# Write the nth term to the 'sir.out' file
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(nth_term + '\n')
```

This code should work correctly, and it does not use NumPy or any other external libraries. It is purely using Python's built-in functions, which ensures compatibility in any standard Python environment without the need for additional modules.
