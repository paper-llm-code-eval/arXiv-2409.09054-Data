Mihai s-a decis în sfârșit să compună o melodie. Fără să știe de unde să înceapă, a scris pe o foaie $n$ note muzicale. Fiecare notă muzicală este definită de două valori reprezentând durata și înălțimea acesteia astfel:
* **durata** este exprimată printr-o fracție de forma $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2^x}$, unde $x$ este un număr natural nenul;
* **înălțimea** este exprimată printr-un număr natural nenul $y$.

Durata unui grup de note este egală cu suma duratelor notelor din grup. Pentru a compune o melodie corect din punct de vedere muzical, el trebuie să distribuie toate notele în grupuri disjuncte, astfel încât durata fiecărui grup să fie $1$. Mihai definește **scorul unui grup** de note ca fiind suma înălțimilor tuturor notelor din grup, ridicată la pătrat. De asemenea, el definește **scorul unei melodii** ca fiind suma scorurilor tuturor grupurilor de note formate
care pot forma un grup.

Mihai vrea să afle care este scorul maxim al unei melodii pe care îl poate obține după gruparea tuturor notelor date.

# Cerință

Dându-se $n$ note sub forma a $n$ perechi de numere, $x$ și $y$, să se afișeze scorul maxim ce poate fi obținut după gruparea tuturor notelor date în grupuri disjuncte.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `partitura.in` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de note, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț, pentru fiecare din cele $n$ note.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `partitura.out` va conține un singur număr natural reprezentând scorul maxim cerut.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 300 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq x \leq 18$;
* $1 \leq y \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că se pot distribui toate notele date în grupuri de durată $1$.
* Pentru $20$ de puncte, $n \leq 4$, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $22$ de puncte, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, pentru toate notele, $x$ are aceeași valoare;
* Pentru $41$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    return n, notes

def write_output(file_name, max_score):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_score))

def calculate_max_score(n, notes):
    # Create a dictionary to store the total height for each possible duration
    duration_height = {}

    # Calculate the duration as 1/2^x and sum the heights for each unique duration
    for x, y in notes:
        duration = 1 / (2 ** x)
        if duration in duration_height:
            duration_height[duration] += y
        else:
            duration_height[duration] = y

    # Sort the heights in descending order to maximize the score
    heights_sorted = sorted(duration_height.values(), reverse=True)

    # Calculate the score by summing the squares of the heights
    score = sum(height * height for height in heights_sorted)
    return score

# Read the input from the file
n, notes = read_input('partitura.in')

# Calculate the maximum score
max_score = calculate_max_score(n, notes)

# Write the output to the file
write_output('partitura.out', max_score)
```
```

This solution reads the input from `partitura.in`, processes the notes to calculate the maximum score, and writes the result to `partitura.out`. The code is designed to be memory efficient, avoiding the creation of unnecessary data structures and using numpy for operations on arrays if needed. The solution is expected to work within the given memory constraints.

Since the environment does not have the `numpy` library, I will provide a solution that does not rely on external libraries, only utilizing standard Python data structures.

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    return n, notes

def write_output(file_name, max_score):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_score) + '\n')

def calculate_max_score(n, notes):
    # Create a dictionary to store the total height for each possible duration
    duration_height = {}

    # Process each note to calculate its duration and sum heights for each duration
    for x, y in notes:
        duration = 1 << x  # Using bit shift for power of 2
        if duration in duration_height:
            duration_height[duration] += y
        else:
            duration_height[duration] = y

    # Create a list of durations that can combine to form a full note (duration of 1)
    durations = sorted(duration_height.keys())
    heights = [0] * (max(durations) + 1)
    
    # Fill the list with the sum of heights for each duration
    for duration, height in duration_height.items():
        heights[duration] = height

    # Calculate the score using dynamic programming
    dp = [0] * (max(durations) + 1)
    for duration in durations:
        for i in range(duration, len(dp)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - duration] + heights[duration] ** 2)

    # The last element in dp will contain the max score with full duration notes
    max_score = dp[-1]
    return max_score

# Read the input from the file
n, notes = read_input('partitura.in')

# Calculate the maximum score
max_score = calculate_max_score(n, notes)

# Write the output to the file
write_output('partitura.out', max_score)
```
This code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum score, and reads from and writes to the specified files without using `numpy`. It should work within the given memory constraints and is optimized for efficiency in both time and memory usage.

The previous dynamic programming approach was incorrect. The problem is essentially about combining notes into groups where the total duration equals 1. The best way to do this is to sum the heights of notes with the same durations and then find the best combination of these sums that make up a full note. We can then square these sums and add them together to get the score. Since we are given that the distribution of notes into full groups is always possible, we are mainly concerned with maximizing the score.

Here's the revised solution, which uses a different approach to calculate the maximum score:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    return n, notes

def write_output(file_name, max_score):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_score) + '\n')

def calculate_max_score(n, notes):
    # Initialize a list to store the sum of heights for each power of 2
    sum_heights = [0] * 19  # Since x <= 18

    # Process each note to calculate its duration and sum heights for powers of 2
    for x, y in notes:
        sum_heights[x] += y

    # We start combining notes, beginning with the smallest fractions (largest x)
    score = 0
    carry = 0  # This will store the height sum that is carried to the next duration
    for x in range(18, 0, -1):
        # Each carry from the previous step is doubled (as we move to a larger note fraction)
        carry *= 2
        # Add the current sum of heights to the carry
        carry += sum_heights[x]
        # Calculate how many full notes can be made from the current carry
        full_notes, carry = divmod(carry, 2 ** x)
        # Add the score for the full notes
        score += full_notes * (2 ** x * carry) ** 2

    return score

# Read the input from the file
n, notes = read_input('partitura.in')

# Calculate the maximum score
max_score = calculate_max_score(n, notes)

# Write the output to the file
write_output('partitura.out', max_score)
```

This algorithm works by finding the sum of heights for each fraction of the form $2^{-x}$ and then combining them optimally to form full notes. The `carry` tracks the accumulated height as we progress through the fractions, ensuring that we maximize the sum of heights for each full note we can form, which ultimately maximizes the score.

Upon reviewing the provided code and the expected versus actual outputs, it's clear that the logic for combining the notes into groups with a total duration of 1 has a mistake. The issue lies in the loop where we attempt to combine the notes and calculate the score. The revised approach should be to sort the notes based on the power of two (duration), combine them from the lowest duration to the highest, and calculate the score based on the groups formed.

Here is a new solution that should correct this mistake and provide the correct output:

```python
def read_input(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]
    return n, notes

def write_output(file_name, max_score):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_score) + '\n')

def calculate_max_score(n, notes):
    # Sort notes by their duration (x value) in descending order
    notes.sort(reverse=True)
    
    score = 0
    group_height = 0
    group_duration = 0

    for x, y in notes:
        duration = 1 / (2 ** x)
        group_duration += duration
        group_height += y
        
        # Whenever a group is full (duration is 1), calculate its score
        if group_duration == 1.0:
            score += group_height ** 2
            # Reset group values
            group_duration = 0
            group_height = 0
        # If the group duration exceeds 1 (which should not happen per the problem statement)
        elif group_duration > 1.0:
            raise ValueError("Group duration exceeded 1, which should not be possible")

    return score

# Read the input from the file
n, notes = read_input('partitura.in')

# Calculate the maximum score
max_score = calculate_max_score(n, notes)

# Write the output to the file
write_output('partitura.out', max_score)
```

This solution assumes that `partitura.in` contains a valid set of notes that can be combined into groups with a total duration of 1, as guaranteed by the problem statement. It sorts the notes based on their duration and combines them into full groups, calculating the score for each group as it is completed. If the group duration ever exceeds 1, an error is raised, which should never happen if the input is valid.
