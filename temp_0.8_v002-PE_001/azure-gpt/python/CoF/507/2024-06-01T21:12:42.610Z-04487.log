Mihai s-a decis în sfârșit să compună o melodie. Fără să știe de unde să înceapă, a scris pe o foaie $n$ note muzicale. Fiecare notă muzicală este definită de două valori reprezentând durata și înălțimea acesteia astfel:
* **durata** este exprimată printr-o fracție de forma $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2^x}$, unde $x$ este un număr natural nenul;
* **înălțimea** este exprimată printr-un număr natural nenul $y$.

Durata unui grup de note este egală cu suma duratelor notelor din grup. Pentru a compune o melodie corect din punct de vedere muzical, el trebuie să distribuie toate notele în grupuri disjuncte, astfel încât durata fiecărui grup să fie $1$. Mihai definește **scorul unui grup** de note ca fiind suma înălțimilor tuturor notelor din grup, ridicată la pătrat. De asemenea, el definește **scorul unei melodii** ca fiind suma scorurilor tuturor grupurilor de note formate
care pot forma un grup.

Mihai vrea să afle care este scorul maxim al unei melodii pe care îl poate obține după gruparea tuturor notelor date.

# Cerință

Dându-se $n$ note sub forma a $n$ perechi de numere, $x$ și $y$, să se afișeze scorul maxim ce poate fi obținut după gruparea tuturor notelor date în grupuri disjuncte.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `partitura.in` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural $n$, reprezentând numărul de note, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii se vor afla câte două numere naturale $x$ și $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu, cu semnificația din enunț, pentru fiecare din cele $n$ note.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `partitura.out` va conține un singur număr natural reprezentând scorul maxim cerut.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 \leq n \leq 300 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq x \leq 18$;
* $1 \leq y \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că se pot distribui toate notele date în grupuri de durată $1$.
* Pentru $20$ de puncte, $n \leq 4$, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $22$ de puncte, $x = 1$;
* Pentru $17$ puncte, pentru toate notele, $x$ are aceeași valoare;
* Pentru $41$ de puncte, nu există restricții suplimentare.

                    group_size_diff = 2 ** (other_duration - duration)
                    while remaining_pitches and len(other_pitches) >= group_size_diff:
                        group_sum = sum(remaining_pitches)
                        for _ in range(group_size_diff):
                            group_sum += other_pitches.pop()
                        score += group_sum ** 2
                        remaining_pitches = []
                    if not remaining_pitches:
                        break

    return score

def main():
    with open('partitura.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline())
        notes = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

    # Convert duration from 1/2^x to x for easier processing
    notes = [(int(np.log2(2**18 / x)), y) for x, y in notes]
    result = optimize_score(notes)

    with open('partitura.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation:
- I have read the notes from 'partitura.in' and converted the duration to a simple exponent for easier handling.
- The `optimize_score` function calculates the score by grouping the notes with the same duration and then sorting each group's pitches in descending order to maximize the score.
- For each duration, I form as many full groups as possible and calculate their scores.
- For remaining pitches that can't form a full group, I try to combine them with other pitches from durations with more extended notes (smaller exponents) to form groups.
- Finally, the calculated maximum score is written to 'partitura.out'.

The stderr indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the execution environment. Since the objective is to optimize for memory usage and the environment does not support `numpy`, we can avoid using it and instead use simple arithmetic to convert the duration from $\frac{1}{2^x}$ to $x$.

Here is the rewritten solution without using `numpy`:

```python
def optimize_score(notes, max_duration):
    # Initialize dictionary to hold pitches with their durations
    durations = {i: [] for i in range(max_duration + 1)}
    for duration, pitch in notes:
        durations[duration].append(pitch)

    # Sort pitches in descending order within each duration
    for duration in durations:
        durations[duration].sort(reverse=True)

    score = 0
    for duration, pitches in durations.items():
        while pitches:
            group_duration = 0
            group_pitch_sum = 0
            i = 0
            # Form a group of duration 1
            while i < len(pitches) and group_duration + (1 / (2 ** duration)) <= 1:
                group_pitch_sum += pitches[i]
                group_duration += 1 / (2 ** duration)
                i += 1
            # Remove the pitches that were used to form the group
            pitches = pitches[i:]
            # Update the score
            score += group_pitch_sum ** 2

    return score

def main():
    # Read input data
    with open('partitura.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        max_duration = 0
        notes = []
        for _ in range(n):
            x, y = map(int, file.readline().split())
            notes.append((x, y))
            max_duration = max(max_duration, x)

    # Calculate the score
    result = optimize_score(notes, max_duration)

    # Write output data
    with open('partitura.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of the solution uses simple arithmetic to manage durations and pitches, complying with the memory constraints and avoiding the use of external libraries like `numpy`. It performs grouping and score calculation based on the constraints given in the problem statement, ensuring an optimal score for the melody.

The result differs because the initial solution does not properly group the notes to maximize the score. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the grouping of notes with different durations. The choice of which notes to group should be based on maximizing the pitch sum squared for each group, which is not effectively done in the previous solution.

To maximize the pitch sum squared, we should prioritize grouping notes with higher pitches. Additionally, we need to manage the different durations correctly, ensuring that notes are combined such that their total duration is equal to 1.

Here is a fixed and optimized solution:

```python
def main():
    with open('partitura.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        durations = [0] * 19  # Using 19 to cover the range [0, 18]
        pitches = [[] for _ in range(19)]

        for _ in range(n):
            x, y = map(int, file.readline().split())
            durations[x] += 1
            pitches[x].append(y)

    # Sort pitches within each duration in descending order
    for pitch_list in pitches:
        pitch_list.sort(reverse=True)

    score = 0
    for i in range(1, 19):
        while durations[i] > 0:
            sum_pitch = 0
            # Calculate how many notes of the current duration we need
            # to fill a group with total duration of 1
            needed = 1 << (i - 1)
            for j in range(i, 0, -1):
                take = min(durations[j], needed)
                sum_pitch += sum(pitches[j][:take])  # Take the highest pitches
                pitches[j] = pitches[j][take:]  # Remove the taken pitches
                durations[j] -= take
                needed -= take
                if needed == 0:
                    break
            score += sum_pitch ** 2

    with open('partitura.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(score))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this solution, I used a two-fold strategy:

1. For each duration, I sorted the pitches in descending order.
2. I iterated through the durations, and for each duration, I started grouping notes from the current duration downwards, always taking the highest pitches available to maximize the score.

This strategy ensures that we always use the highest available pitches to fill the groups, which maximizes the sum of the pitches squared for each group. The total score is then the sum of all group scores.

The results differ because the previous solution incorrectly processes the grouping of notes with different durations and does not properly maximize the pitch sum squared for each group. The main idea to obtain the maximum score is to always attempt to form groups by using the shortest duration notes available and to sum the highest pitches until a group with total duration of 1 is formed.

Here is a revised approach to solve the problem:

1. Group all notes with the same duration together.
2. Within each duration group, sort the pitches in descending order.
3. Start forming groups starting with the shortest duration notes first. When a group reaches the total duration of 1, square the sum of pitches and add it to the score.
4. If there are remaining notes that cannot form a complete group, try to complement them with notes of smaller durations to reach the total duration of 1.

This approach ensures that we utilize the highest pitches first, leading to a higher score as we are maximizing the sum squared of the pitches for each group.

Let's implement this revised solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    with open('partitura.in', 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        notes = defaultdict(list)

        for _ in range(n):
            x, y = map(int, file.readline().split())
            duration = 2 ** (-x)
            notes[duration].append(y)

    score = 0
    # Sort pitches within each duration in descending order
    for duration in notes:
        notes[duration].sort(reverse=True)

    # Combine notes to form groups with total duration equal to 1
    while notes:
        group_pitch_sum = 0
        current_duration = 1
        durations_to_remove = []

        for duration in sorted(notes.keys()):
            while current_duration >= duration and notes[duration]:
                group_pitch_sum += notes[duration].pop(0)
                current_duration -= duration

            if not notes[duration]:  # If there are no notes left for this duration, mark it for removal
                durations_to_remove.append(duration)

            if current_duration == 0:  # If the current group is full, break the loop
                break

        # Remove empty durations
        for duration in durations_to_remove:
            del notes[duration]

        # Add the score of the current full group
        score += group_pitch_sum ** 2

    with open('partitura.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(score))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this solution, I used a defaultdict to store the notes grouped by their duration, with the key being the duration, and the value being a list of pitches. I sorted each list of pitches in descending order to ensure that the highest pitches are used first. Then, I iterated over durations in ascending order to form complete groups with a total duration of one, summing the pitches and squaring the sum for the score. This process continues until no more full groups can be formed, which guarantees that we are maximizing the score.
