Se dă un număr $N$, și un șir de $N$ numere naturale nenule.

# Cerință
1. Determinați suma valorilor aflate pe ultimele $K$ poziții în șir (unde $K$ reprezintă valoarea celei mai din dreapta cifre nenule a primei valori din șir).
2. Ne imaginăm împărțirea șirului în secvențe în următorul mod: prima secvență este formată din primele $L$ elemente, a doua este formată din următoarele $L - 1$ elemente, a treia este formată din următoarele $L - 2$ elemente și așa mai departe, ultima secvență este formată dintr-un singur element și acesta **coincide cu ultimul element din șir**. Considerând suma valorilor fiecărei secvențe, să se determine cea mai mare dintre aceste sume.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului `sss.in` se află două valori $C$ și $N$ separate printr-un spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu. Pentru $C = 1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$ iar pentru $C = 2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `sss.out` conține un singur număr care reprezintă valoarea calculată conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Valorile din șir sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 100 \ 000$;
* Se garantează că pentru testele în care $C = 1$ șirul are cel puțin $K$ elemente;
* Se garantează că valoarea lui N permite descompunerea conform descrierii, pentru testele care au $C = 2$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $51$ de puncte avem $C = 1$;
* Pentru $27$ de puncte dintre testele în care $C = 1$, primul număr din șir are o cifră;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $49$ de puncte avem $C = 2$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $22$ de puncte dintre cele care au $C = 2$, valoarea lui $N$ este mai mică sau egală cu $10$.
* Denumirea problemei este o prescurtare de la “sume și secvențe”.

This solution follows the problem statement and optimizes both time and memory usage by using numpy arrays and performing efficient array operations. The `read_input` and `write_output` functions handle file operations, while `last_nonzero_digit`, `solve_problem_c1`, and `solve_problem_c2` encapsulate the logic for the two different problem requirements. The `main` function ties everything together, reading the problem type and sequence, solving the problem, and writing the result to the output file.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the execution environment. Since the memory limit is ~8MB and the use of additional libraries like `numpy` might not be feasible, I will rewrite the solution to solve the problem using only built-in Python functionalities, which will also ensure compatibility with any Python environment.

Here's the rewritten solution in a markdown code block:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c_n_pair = file.readline().strip().split()
        sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    return int(c_n_pair[0]), sequence

def last_nonzero_digit(num):
    while num % 10 == 0:
        num //= 10
    return num % 10

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def solve_problem_c1(sequence, k):
    return sum(sequence[-k:])

def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)
    start = 0
    while l > 0:
        current_sum = sum(sequence[start:start + l])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        start += l
        l -= 1
    return max_sum

def main():
    c, sequence = read_input('sss.in')
    if c == 1:
        k = last_nonzero_digit(sequence[0])
        result = solve_problem_c1(sequence, k)

        result = solve_problem_c2(sequence)
    else:

This solution should work without any external libraries and under the given memory constraints. It manages file operations with built-in functions and computes the required results using Python's standard functions and control structures.

After reviewing the provided input data and the expected output, it appears that my initial approach for problem C=2 has a logic error in computing the sum of sequences. The issue is in the `solve_problem_c2` function, where the approach does not correctly implement the problem specification regarding the formation of sequences and their sums.

The expected output for the given input is `11`, which indicates that the largest sum sequence is not being correctly identified. According to the problem statement, we are supposed to create sequences by starting with the first `L` elements, then `L-1` elements, and so on until we reach a sequence consisting of just one element, which should be the last element in the series. The condition that the last sequence coincides with the last element of the series implies that we are not dividing the sequence into equal lengths but rather decrementing the length of each sequence by one as we proceed.

Let's correct the `solve_problem_c2` function:

```python
def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)  # Length of the sequence
    while l > 0:
        current_sum = sum(sequence[-l:])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        l -= 1
    return max_sum
```

Now, let me rewrite the entire solution including the correction:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c_n_pair = file.readline().strip().split()
        sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    return int(c_n_pair[0]), sequence

def last_nonzero_digit(num):
    while num % 10 == 0:
        num //= 10
    return num % 10

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def solve_problem_c1(sequence, k):
    return sum(sequence[-k:])

def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)
    while l > 0:
        current_sum = sum(sequence[-l:])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        l -= 1
    return max_sum

def main():
    c, sequence = read_input('sss.in')
    if c == 1:
        k = last_nonzero_digit(sequence[0])
        result = solve_problem_c1(sequence, k)
    elif c == 2:
        result = solve_problem_c2(sequence)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for C.")
    write_output('sss.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated solution should now correctly calculate the sum of sequences as per the problem's requirements and produce the expected output.

My previous correction was incorrect, and the implementation of `solve_problem_c2` still does not match the problem specification.

The proper way to handle the sequences is to decrease the length of each subsequent sequence by one, starting from the beginning of the series each time. This means that the first sequence consists of the first `L` elements, the second sequence consists of the first `L-1` elements, and so on, until the last sequence that consists of only the last element of the series.

Let's implement the correct logic for `solve_problem_c2` function:

```python
def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)  # Length of the sequence
    # Iterate through the sequence creating decreasing length subsequences
    for i in range(l, 0, -1):
        current_sum = sum(sequence[:i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
```

Now, let me rewrite the entire solution including the correct logic:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c_n_pair = file.readline().strip().split()
        sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    return int(c_n_pair[0]), sequence

def last_nonzero_digit(num):
    while num % 10 == 0:
        num //= 10
    return num % 10

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def solve_problem_c1(sequence, k):
    return sum(sequence[-k:])

def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)  # Length of the sequence
    # Iterate through the sequence creating decreasing length subsequences
    for i in range(l, 0, -1):
        current_sum = sum(sequence[:i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def main():
    c, sequence = read_input('sss.in')
    if c == 1:
        k = last_nonzero_digit(sequence[0])
        result = solve_problem_c1(sequence, k)
    elif c == 2:
        result = solve_problem_c2(sequence)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for C.")
    write_output('sss.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected solution should now accurately compute the sum of the sequences as defined by the problem statement and yield the expected output of `11` for the provided input.

Upon re-evaluating the problem and the code, I realize that the implementation of `solve_problem_c2` is not correctly following the problem description. The mistake is in the way the sequences are calculated: the current implementation incorrectly assumes that each sequence starts from the first element of the array.

According to the problem statement, we are supposed to take subsequences from the entire sequence in a particular manner: first, we take the first `L` elements, then the next `L-1` elements (starting from the second element), then `L-2` starting from the third element, and so on, until we are left with the last element of the series as a single-element sequence.

Let's correct the `solve_problem_c2` function and the entire solution accordingly:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c_n_pair = file.readline().strip().split()
        sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    return int(c_n_pair[0]), sequence

def last_nonzero_digit(num):
    while num % 10 == 0:
        num //= 10
    return num % 10

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def solve_problem_c1(sequence, k):
    return sum(sequence[-k:])

def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)
    # Iterate through the sequence creating decreasing length subsequences
    for start in range(l):
        current_sum = sum(sequence[start:l-start])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def main():
    c, sequence = read_input('sss.in')
    if c == 1:
        k = last_nonzero_digit(sequence[0])
        result = solve_problem_c1(sequence, k)
    elif c == 2:
        result = solve_problem_c2(sequence)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for C.")
    write_output('sss.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected solution now should properly compute the sums of the sequences as per the problem's requirements and produce the expected output of `11` for the given input.

I apologize for the confusion. The previous solutions still did not accurately implement the sequence partitioning as described in the problem statement. After re-evaluating the algorithm, I understand the proper sequence formation now.

The correct approach is to form a sequence of length `L`, then form the next sequence starting from the second element with a length of `L-1`, then starting from the third element with a length of `L-2`, and so on, until we are left with the last element by itself.

To fix the implementation of `solve_problem_c2`, we need to change the way we calculate the sum for each sequence:

```python
def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        current_sum = sum(sequence[i:i + (len(sequence) - i)])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
```

Let's rewrite the entire solution with this corrected logic:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    return c, sequence

def last_nonzero_digit(num):

def solve_problem_c2(sequence):

    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        current_sum = sum(sequence[i:i + (len(sequence) - i)])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def main():
    c, sequence = read_input('sss.in')
    if c == 1:
        k = last_nonzero_digit(sequence[0])
        result = solve_problem_c1(sequence, k)
    elif c == 2:

    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for C.")
    write_output('sss.out', result)

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was a misunderstanding in the implementation of the `solve_problem_c2` function. The expected output is `11`, which means the algorithm did not correctly identify the sequence with the largest sum.

The problem states that we gradually decrease the size of the sequence (starting with `L` elements, then `L-1`, and so on) until we are left with a single element, which is the last element of the original sequence. The error in the previous solutions was in the slicing logic for the subsequences.

Let us correct the implementation with the appropriate logic:

```python
def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)
    for size in range(1, l + 1):
        max_sum = max(max_sum, sum(sequence[-size:]))
    return max_sum
```

With this fix, the `solve_problem_c2` function will correctly compute the maximum sum of any sequence formed by taking the last `L`, `L-1`, ..., 1 elements from the original sequence.

Here is the entire solution rewritten with the necessary fix:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
        sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
    return c, sequence

def last_nonzero_digit(num):
    return int(str(num).rstrip('0')[-1])

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def solve_problem_c1(sequence, k):
    return sum(sequence[-k:])

def solve_problem_c2(sequence):
    max_sum = 0
    l = len(sequence)
    for size in range(1, l + 1):
        max_sum = max(max_sum, sum(sequence[-size:]))
    return max_sum

def main():
    c, sequence = read_input('sss.in')
    if c == 1:
        k = last_nonzero_digit(sequence[0])
        result = solve_problem_c1(sequence, k)
    elif c == 2:
        result = solve_problem_c2(sequence)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for C.")
    write_output('sss.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution should now correctly identify the sequence with the largest sum and produce the expected output for both `C=1` and `C=2` cases. The expected output for the provided input should be `11`, as required.
