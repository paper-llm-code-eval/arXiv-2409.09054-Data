Se dă numărul natural $k$. Dorim să obţinem un tablou unidimensional $a$, cu elemente naturale constituite astfel: $a_1 =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_1$ este cifra sutelor produsului $k \cdot k$, iar cifra unităţilor lui $a_1$ este cifra zecilor produsului $k \cdot k$).

Pentru $i > 1$, $a_i$ se obţine astfel: $a_i =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra sutelor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$, iar cifra unităţilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra zecilor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$).

Procesul de generare a termenilor tabloului se încheie în momentul când este generat un număr ce a mai fost generat înainte. Ultimul număr (cel ce se repetă) nu face parte din tablou.

Este posibil ca numerele numite în text ca fiind de “două cifre” să aibă de fapt doar o cifră, în cazul în care cifra zecilor lor este $0$; ele pot fi chiar şi $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care:

1. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut;
2. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut, dar sortate crescător după prima lor cifră (cea mai din stânga).

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găsește $k$.

# Date de ieșire

* Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea generării lor, separate de un spaţiu.
* Pe a doua linie se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea cerută la cerinţa a doua; elementele vor fi separate de câte un spaţiu

# Restricții și precizări

* $11 \leq k \leq 999$;
* La cerinţa a doua: dacă două sau mai multe elemente din tabloul $a$ au aceeaşi primă cifră, atunci aceste elemente se pot afişa în orice ordine ce respectă cerinţa. În exemplul de mai jos, afişarea pentru cerinţa a doua putea fi şi sub forma: $0 \ 2 \ 25 \ 5 \ 62 \ 84$, adică am interschimbat $2$ cu $25$, pentru că ambele au prima cifră $2$ în acest caz, alte posibilităţi de afişare nu mai sunt.
* Pentru prima cerinţă rezolvată corect se atribuie $60\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru a doua, încă $40\%$ din punctaj.

It appears that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the program is being run. Since `numpy` is not being used in the current solution and does not contribute to the efficiency of the given code, we can remove the import statement for `numpy` without affecting the functionality of the program.

Here's the revised solution without importing `numpy`:

```python
# Efficient function to compute the next array element based on the previous one
def next_element(num):
    product = num * num
    return (product // 100) % 10 * 10 + (product // 10) % 10

# Function to create the array as mentioned in the challenge
def create_array(k):
    seen = set()
    array = []
    
    # Initial number based on k
    num = next_element(k)
    while num not in seen:
        seen.add(num)
        array.append(num)
        num = next_element(num)
    
    return array

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the array

# Write unsorted and sorted arrays to sir.out

    file.write(' '.join(map(str, array)) + '\n')
    
    # Sorting by the first digit and writing the sorted array
    sorted_array = sorted(array, key=lambda x: (x // 10, x))

The difference between the expected and found results lies in the sorted output. The expected output is sorted based on the first digit only, and when multiple numbers have the same first digit, their order relative to each other does not matter as long as they follow the first digit sorting.

In the found output, the sorting was done by the first digit and then by the entire number itself, which caused numbers like '25' and '2' to be sorted as '0 2 5 25...', which is not the desired outcome based on the challenge description.

To fix this, we need to adjust the sorting key function to only consider the first digit. Since the numbers are only at most two digits long, we can sort them by dividing by 10, which will give us only the first digit when present, without considering the second digit at all.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Function to compute the next array element based on the previous one
def next_element(num):
    product = num * num
    return (product // 100) % 10 * 10 + (product // 10) % 10

# Function to create the array as mentioned in the challenge
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen_numbers = set()

    # Compute the first element based on k
    new_element = next_element(k)
    while new_element not in seen_numbers:
        seen_numbers.add(new_element)
        sequence.append(new_element)
        new_element = next_element(new_element)

    return sequence

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the array
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write unsorted and sorted arrays to sir.out
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    # Writing the unsorted array
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    
    # Sorting by the first digit only and writing the sorted array
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10)
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')
```

This revised solution will sort the numbers primarily by their first digits only, ignoring the second digits entirely, and thus will match the expected output.

The issue in the previous solution is in the sorting step. We are sorting by the entire first digit but are not correctly handling the requirement that "if two or more elements from the array have the same first digit, then these elements can be displayed in any order that respects the requirement." This means we should not further sort the elements after considering the first digit.

Let's revise the sorting logic. We want to sort the elements based on the first digit only and ignore the second digit, which can be achieved by sorting elements by the result of integer division by 10. However, the previous solution still indirectly sorts by the second digit due to the default behavior of `sorted`, which continues to sort by the next available sort key (which is the entire number) if the first key results in a tie.

To ensure we sort by the first digit only, we can use a stable sort that doesn't change the relative order of elements that compare equal under the provided sorting keys. Since Python's sort is stable, we can use a key that returns the same value for all elements with the same first digit.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to compute the next array element based on the previous one
def next_element(num):
    product = num * num
    return (product // 100) % 10 * 10 + (product // 10) % 10

# Function to create the array as mentioned in the challenge
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen_numbers = set()

    # Compute the first element based on k
    new_element = next_element(k)
    while new_element not in seen_numbers:
        seen_numbers.add(new_element)
        sequence.append(new_element)
        new_element = next_element(new_element)

    return sequence

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the array
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write unsorted and sorted arrays to sir.out
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    # Writing the unsorted array
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    
    # Sorting by the first digit only and writing the sorted array
    # The lambda function returns the first digit and ignores the second digit.
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10)
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')
```

This solution is now correctly sorting the array based on the first digit only, and because Python's `sorted` is stable, it will not re-sort elements with the same first digit. This should match the expected output.

I apologize for the oversight. The previous solution still did not produce the expected output because I misunderstood the sorting requirement. The expected output requires sorting the array with respect to the first digit, but when the first digit is 0, it should be treated as the lowest value, which affects the order of the elements in the sorted array.

The solution must:
1. Sort the array based on the first digit, treating numbers with the first digit as 0 as the lowest.
2. Keep the relative order of the elements with the same first digit as in the original array (since the stable sort property should maintain the original relative order).

Let's correct the solution to satisfy these requirements:

```python
# Define the function to compute the next array element
def next_element(num):
    product = num * num
    return (product // 100) % 10 * 10 + (product // 10) % 10

# Define the function to generate the sequence
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen_numbers = set()
    
    # Start with the initial number based on k
    new_element = next_element(k)
    
    # Generate the sequence until a number repeats
    while new_element not in seen_numbers:
        seen_numbers.add(new_element)
        sequence.append(new_element)
        new_element = next_element(new_element)
    
    return sequence

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the sequence
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write unsorted and sorted sequences to sir.out
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the unsorted sequence
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    
    # Sort the sequence by the first digit
    # When the first digit is 0, it is treated as the smallest
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10 if x // 10 != 0 else -1))
    
    # Write the sorted sequence
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')
```

This solution should produce a sorted array where elements with a first digit of 0 are treated as the smallest and thus come first in the sorted sequence, while maintaining the original relative order for elements with the same first digit. This should match the expected output.

It appears there has been a misunderstanding in the previous solutions regarding the sorting requirement for the second line of output. The requirement is to sort the elements based on the first digit of each number, and when there are multiple numbers with the same first digit, the relative order among those numbers doesn't matter.

The expected output is `0 25 2 5 62 84`. Here, the numbers are sorted by their first digit, and when the same first digit is encountered, they follow no specific order. This means that we don't need to use the second digit for sorting at all.

To correct the solution, we will sort the numbers based on their first digit only, treating numbers with a single digit as having a '0' for the first digit. We will achieve this by defining a custom sorting key function that correctly handles numbers with a single digit.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to compute the next array element based on the previous one
def next_element(num):
    product = num * num
    tens_digit = (product // 10) % 10
    hundreds_digit = (product // 100) % 10
    return hundreds_digit * 10 + tens_digit

# Function to create the array as mentioned in the challenge
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen_numbers = set()
    new_element = next_element(k)

    while new_element not in seen_numbers:
        seen_numbers.add(new_element)
        sequence.append(new_element)
        new_element = next_element(new_element)

    return sequence

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the sequence
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write the sequence and the sorted sequence to sir.out
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the sequence
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    
    # Sort the sequence by the first digit, treating single-digit numbers as '0x'
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10 if x > 9 else 0)
    
    # Write the sorted sequence
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')
```

This approach should now correctly produce the expected sorted order, where the first digit is the only criterion used for sorting, and numbers with a single digit are treated as if they have a '0' for the first digit.

Upon reviewing the expected and actual output, it's clear that the second line (the sorted list) should list numbers starting with the lowest first digit, followed by others in any order, but always grouped by the first digit. The previous solutions attempted to sort the numbers by considering single-digit numbers as having a first digit of 0 and sorting based on this digit, but the actual output still did not match the expected output.

In the expected output `0 25 2 5 62 84`, the single-digit numbers (`0`, `2`, and `5`) are listed first as their first digit (and only digit) is considered to be the lowest, followed by numbers starting with higher digits.

The correct approach is to:
1. Treat single-digit numbers as having a leading zero.
2. Sort based solely on the first digit, treating all single-digit numbers as starting with `0`.

Here is the corrected solution that should produce the expected sorted order:

```python
# Define the function to compute the next array element
def next_element(num):
    product = num * num
    tens = (product // 10) % 10
    hundreds = (product // 100) % 10
    return hundreds * 10 + tens

# Define the function to generate the sequence
def generate_sequence(k):
    sequence = []
    seen_numbers = set()
    
    # Start with the initial number based on k
    new_element = next_element(k)
    
    # Generate the sequence until a number repeats
    while new_element not in seen_numbers:
        seen_numbers.add(new_element)
        sequence.append(new_element)
        new_element = next_element(new_element)
    
    return sequence

# Read from sir.in
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Generate the sequence
sequence = generate_sequence(k)

# Write unsorted and sorted sequences to sir.out
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the unsorted sequence
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n')
    
    # Define a custom sort key that treats single-digit numbers as having a leading zero
    def sort_key(n):
        return (0, n) if n < 10 else (n // 10, n)
    
    # Sort the sequence using the custom sort key
    sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=sort_key)
    
    # Write the sorted sequence
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n')
```

This solution uses a custom sort key function that pairs each number with a tuple, where the first element of the tuple is the first digit (`0` for single-digit numbers) and the second element is the number itself. This ensures that numbers are grouped and sorted primarily by their first digit, and single-digit numbers are treated as starting with `0`.
