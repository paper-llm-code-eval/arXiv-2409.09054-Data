Se dă numărul natural $k$. Dorim să obţinem un tablou unidimensional $a$, cu elemente naturale constituite astfel: $a_1 =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_1$ este cifra sutelor produsului $k \cdot k$, iar cifra unităţilor lui $a_1$ este cifra zecilor produsului $k \cdot k$).

Pentru $i > 1$, $a_i$ se obţine astfel: $a_i =$ un număr de două cifre (cifra zecilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra sutelor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$, iar cifra unităţilor a lui $a_i$ este cifra zecilor produsului $a_{i-1} \cdot a_{i-1}$).

Procesul de generare a termenilor tabloului se încheie în momentul când este generat un număr ce a mai fost generat înainte. Ultimul număr (cel ce se repetă) nu face parte din tablou.

Este posibil ca numerele numite în text ca fiind de “două cifre” să aibă de fapt doar o cifră, în cazul în care cifra zecilor lor este $0$; ele pot fi chiar şi $0$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care:

1. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut;
2. să afişeze elementele tabloului obţinut, dar sortate crescător după prima lor cifră (cea mai din stânga).

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `sir.in` se găsește $k$.

# Date de ieșire

* Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `sir.out` se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea generării lor, separate de un spaţiu.
* Pe a doua linie se vor afişa elementele tabloului $a$, în ordinea cerută la cerinţa a doua; elementele vor fi separate de câte un spaţiu

# Restricții și precizări

* $11 \leq k \leq 999$;
* La cerinţa a doua: dacă două sau mai multe elemente din tabloul $a$ au aceeaşi primă cifră, atunci aceste elemente se pot afişa în orice ordine ce respectă cerinţa. În exemplul de mai jos, afişarea pentru cerinţa a doua putea fi şi sub forma: $0 \ 2 \ 25 \ 5 \ 62 \ 84$, adică am interschimbat $2$ cu $25$, pentru că ambele au prima cifră $2$ în acest caz, alte posibilităţi de afişare nu mai sunt.
* Pentru prima cerinţă rezolvată corect se atribuie $60\%$ din punctaj, iar pentru a doua, încă $40\%$ din punctaj.

The issue with the previous solution is the sorting key. The problem statement requires sorting the sequence first by the first digit, and if they are the same, the elements can be in any order. However, the previous solution sorted by both the first digit and the value itself, which is not strictly required by the problem statement.

Let's correct the sorting key to only consider the first digit (tens place). If the numbers have the same first digit, their order relative to each other doesn't matter. We'll fix this by sorting only by the tens digit.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution with corrected sorting

with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Initialize variables, ensuring minimal memory usage
last_two_digits = (k * k // 10) % 100  # Calculate initial a1
sequence = [last_two_digits]
seen = {last_two_digits}

while True:
    next_two_digits = (last_two_digits * last_two_digits // 10) % 100
    if next_two_digits in seen:
        break
    sequence.append(next_two_digits)
    seen.add(next_two_digits)
    last_two_digits = next_two_digits

# Sorting the sequence by the first digit without creating additional lists
# The key now only considers the first digit (tens place)
sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10)

# Prepare the output strings
output_original = ' '.join(map(str, sequence))
output_sorted = ' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence))

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output_original + '\n')
    file.write(output_sorted + '\n')
```

This solution should now satisfy the problem statement and provide the expected results.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results is due to the sorting key. The expected output requires the sequence to be sorted by the first digit only (the tens place of each number), but the numbers with the same first digit can remain in their original order. My previous implementation did not adhere to this requirement as it sorted all numbers without considering their original order.

To fix this, we must sort by the tens digit but keep the original order for numbers with the same tens digit. This requires a stable sort, which Python's `sorted()` function provides by default. However, the key function should only consider the tens digit, and we must avoid changing the order of elements with the same tens digit.

Let's fix the key function and ensure the sort is stable:

```python
# Solution with a stable sort by the tens digit with corrected sorting

with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Initialize variables, ensuring minimal memory usage
last_two_digits = (k * k // 10) % 100  # Calculate initial a1
sequence = [last_two_digits]
seen = {last_two_digits}

while True:
    next_two_digits = (last_two_digits * last_two_digits // 10) % 100
    if next_two_digits in seen:
        break
    sequence.append(next_two_digits)
    seen.add(next_two_digits)
    last_two_digits = next_two_digits

# Sorting the sequence by the tens digit using stable sort and ensuring the
# original order is preserved for elements with the same tens digit
sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10)

# Prepare the output strings
output_original = ' '.join(map(str, sequence))
output_sorted = ' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence))

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output_original + '\n')
    file.write(output_sorted + '\n')
```

This revised solution should now correctly sort the sequence according to the tens digit while preserving the original order for elements with the same tens digit, matching the expected output.

The program output differs from the expected output because the sorting key used in the `sorted` function only considers the tens digit for sorting. As per the problem statement, we need to sort the elements primarily by the first digit (the tens digit), but we must also ensure that numbers with the same first digit retain their original relative order.

We can fix this by applying a stable sort algorithm, ensuring that when two numbers have the same tens digit, they are ordered as they appear in the original sequence. In Python, the `sorted()` function is stable, but we need to ensure that our sorting key is only sorting by the tens digit and not inadvertently also by the units digit.

Here's the revised solution that should produce the correct output:

```python
# Corrected solution with stable sort by the first digit only (tens place).

with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Initialize variables, ensuring minimal memory usage
last_num = (k * k // 10) % 100  # Calculate initial a1
sequence = [last_num]
seen = {last_num}

while True:
    next_num = (last_num * last_num // 10) % 100
    if next_num in seen:
        break
    sequence.append(next_num)
    seen.add(next_num)
    last_num = next_num

# Sorting the sequence by the first digit (tens place) while preserving the original order for elements with the same first digit
sorted_sequence = [seq for tens in range(10) for seq in sequence if seq // 10 == tens]

# Prepare the output strings
output_original = ' '.join(map(str, sequence))
output_sorted = ' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence))

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output_original + '\n')
    file.write(output_sorted + '\n')
```

This code creates a `sorted_sequence` that only sorts the numbers by their tens digit and maintains their original relative order when the tens digits are the same. This approach ensures that we meet the problem statement's requirements and should generate the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output is due to the sorting method used. The expected output requires us to sort the sequence such that the numbers are ordered firstly by their leading digit (which is the tens digit for two-digit numbers and the units digit itself for one-digit numbers), and secondly, in the case where two numbers have the same leading digit, their order relative to each other does not matter.

My previous code attempted to sort the sequence using a method that was supposed to maintain the original order for numbers with the same tens digit, but it incorrectly sorted the sequence by the tens digit only, without considering that single-digit numbers should be treated as having 0 as their tens digit.

Let's correct the implementation. We will use the fact that Python's sort is stable, meaning that if two elements are considered equal (have the same leading digit), their relative order will be preserved. We will implement a custom sort key that puts single-digit numbers at the beginning.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
# Corrected solution with proper sorting by the first digit while treating single-digit numbers correctly.

with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Initialize variables, ensuring minimal memory usage
last_num = (k * k // 10) % 100  # Calculate initial a1
sequence = [last_num]
seen = {last_num}

while True:
    next_num = (last_num * last_num // 10) % 100
    if next_num in seen:
        break
    sequence.append(next_num)
    seen.add(next_num)
    last_num = next_num

# Sorting the sequence by the first digit, treating single-digit numbers as having a 0 as their tens digit
sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: x // 10 if x >= 10 else 0)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines([' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n', ' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n'])
```

This solution should now output the sequence sorted correctly by the first digit and treat single-digit numbers as if they had a leading 0, while also ensuring that numbers with the same leading digit are not re-ordered amongst themselves.

The discrepancy is due to the sorting criteria not being correctly implemented according to the problem statement. The sorting should prioritize the first digit but not change the order of elements with the same first digit.

We need to ensure that our sorting function treats single-digit numbers (including 0) as having a "0" for their tens digit and sorts them accordingly, while maintaining the order of appearance for numbers with the same tens digit.

Here's another attempt to provide the correct solution:

```python
# Corrected solution with stable sorting by the tens digit (first digit)

with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())

# Initialize variables, ensuring minimal memory usage
last_num = (k * k // 10) % 100  # Calculate initial a1
sequence = [last_num]
seen = {last_num}

while True:
    next_num = (last_num * last_num // 10) % 100
    if next_num in seen:
        break
    sequence.append(next_num)
    seen.add(next_num)
    last_num = next_num

# Sorting the sequence by the first digit while maintaining the order for same first digits
# Single-digit numbers are adjusted to have a tens digit of 0
sorted_sequence = sorted(sequence, key=lambda x: (x // 10, sequence.index(x)))

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines([
        ' '.join(map(str, sequence)) + '\n',  # Original sequence
        ' '.join(map(str, sorted_sequence)) + '\n'  # Sorted sequence
    ])
```

In this solution, we're using `sorted()` with a key function that returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the tens digit (the first digit of the number), and the second element is the index of the number in the original sequence. This will ensure that the sort is stable—a number with the same first digit as another will retain its original ordering relative to that number.

This code should produce the correct output file `sir.out` that matches the expected output.
