În orașul $X$ va avea loc o nouă ediție a concursului $Y$, la care participă trei echipe având numerele de concurs $1$, $2$ și $3$. Echipele pot avea număr diferit de concurenți. 

Ordinea în care participanții intră în concurs este una oarecare. Fiecare concurent are de susținut $9$ probe. La fiecare probă, un concurent obține un punctaj exprimat printr-un număr natural, cuprins între $0$ și $10$, inclusiv.

La scurt timp după ce un concurent a susținut toate cele $9$ probe, se afișează performanța concurentului sub forma a două numere naturale, astfel:

* primul număr poate fi $1$, $2$ sau $3$ și reprezintă echipa din care face parte concurentul;
* al doilea număr este obținut prin concatenarea (alipirea) numerelor ce reprezintă punctajele **nenule** obținute de concurent la cele $9$ probe. Dacă un concurent are punctaj $0$ la toate probele atunci al doilea număr este $0$.

Punctajul total al unui concurent se obține adunând punctajele obținute de acesta la cele $9$ probe. Punctajul unei echipe se obține adunând punctajele totale obtinute de membrii acesteia. De exemplu, afișajul $2\ 14102172$ semnifică faptul că acest concurent face parte din echipa $2$ și are punctajele nenule $1$, $4$, $10$, $2$, $1$, $7$ și $2$, la $7$ dintre cele 9 probe susținute. La celelalte două probe a avut punctajul $0$. Punctajul său total este $27$, contribuția sa la punctajul echipei $2$ fiind de $27$ de puncte.

Este declarată campioană echipa cu punctajul cel mai mare. Dacă mai multe echipe au obținut cel mai mare punctaj, atunci toate aceste echipe sunt declarate campioane. Totuși, dacă toate echipele au totalizat $0$ puncte, atunci nicio echipă nu este declarată campioană.

# Cerință

Cunoscând numărul $N$ de concurenți, echipele din care fac parte precum și punctajele obținute de fiecare dintre ei, să se determine:

1. punctajul maxim obținut de un concurent și numărul de concurenți care au obținut acest punctaj;
2. numărul sau numerele de concurs ale echipelor declarate campioane, în ordine crescătoare, și punctajul obținut de acestea. Dacă toate echipele au punctajul final $0$, se va afișa textul `FARA CAMPION`.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `concurs.in` conține pe prima linie un număr $C$ (care poate fi $1$ sau $2$), indicând cerința de rezolvat. 
Pe a doua linie se găsește un număr natural $N$ reprezentând numărul de concurenți, iar pe fiecare dintre următoarele $N$ linii se găsesc câte două numere naturale, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând echipa și punctajele fiecăruia dintre cei $N$ concurenți, în ordinea intrării în concurs.

# Date de ieșire

1. Dacă $C = 1$, fișierul de ieșire `concurs.out` va conține pe o singură linie două numere naturale, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând punctajul maxim obținut de un concurent și numărul de concurenți care au obținut acest punctaj.
2. Dacă $C = 2$, fișierul de ieșire va conține pe o singură linie textul `FARA CAMPION` dacă toate echipele au la final punctajul $0$. În caz contrar linia va conține două, trei sau patru numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând numărul sau numerele de concurs ale echipelor declarate campioane, în ordine crescătoare, și apoi punctajul obținut de acestea.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru teste în valoare de $35$ de puncte avem $C = 1$.
* Pentru teste în valoare de $65$ de puncte avem $C = 2$.

The error indicates that the numpy module is not available in the execution environment. To conform to the challenge requirements and also to deal with the memory limit, I'll proceed without relying on numpy or any external libraries.

Here is a revised solution considering the memory constraints and not depending on numpy:

```python
# Function to calculate team scores and individual scores
def calculate_scores(N, data):
    # Initialize scores
    individual_scores = [0] * N
    team_scores = [0] * 4  # 4 slots to correspond to team numbers 1, 2, and 3
    
    for i in range(N):
        team, score_string = data[i]
        score = sum([int(ch) for ch in score_string if ch != '0'])
        individual_scores[i] = score
        team_scores[team] += score
    
    return individual_scores, team_scores

        contestants.append((int(team), score_string.strip()))

    individual_scores, _ = calculate_scores(N, contestants)
    
    # Find max score and the number of contestants with max score
    max_score = max(individual_scores)
    max_score_count = individual_scores.count(max_score)
    
    # Write results to 'concurs.out'
    with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{max_score} {max_score_count}\n")

    else:
        # Get teams with the highest score

The result differs because the current implementation does not correctly calculate the highest individual score among the contestants. It seems that the logic to find the max score and the number of contestants with the max score is incorrect.

Upon reviewing the code, I realized that I'm not considering zero scores correctly while calculating individual scores. I incorrectly assumed that removing zeros from the score string would suffice, but the logic actually requires concatenating non-zero scores and then summing them up. Furthermore, the condition to determine the max score count should consider zero scores specifically.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Function to calculate team scores and individual scores
def calculate_scores(N, data):
    # Initialize scores
    individual_scores = [0] * N
    team_scores = [0] * 4  # 4 slots to correspond to team numbers 1, 2, and 3
    
    for i in range(N):
        team, score_string = data[i]
        # Calculate individual score, consider each character if it's not '0'
        score = sum(int(ch) for ch in score_string if ch != '0')
        individual_scores[i] = score
        # Add to team score
        team_scores[team] += score
    
    return individual_scores, team_scores

# Read data from file 'concurs.in'
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline())
    N = int(file.readline())
    
    # Parse contestant data
    contestants = []
    for _ in range(N):
        team, score_string = file.readline().split()
        contestants.append((int(team), score_string.strip()))

# Solve challenge based on the choice of problem
if C == 1:
    # Calculate individual scores
    individual_scores, _ = calculate_scores(N, contestants)
    
    # Find max score and the number of contestants with max score
    max_score = max(individual_scores)
    if max_score == 0:
        max_score_count = N  # All scores are zero, all contestants have the max score
    else:
        max_score_count = individual_scores.count(max_score)
    
    # Write results to 'concurs.out'
    with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{max_score} {max_score_count}\n")

elif C == 2:
    # Calculate team scores
    _, team_scores = calculate_scores(N, contestants)
    
    # Determine if there is a champion
    highest_score = max(team_scores[1:])  # Skip index 0 as it's not used
    if highest_score == 0:
        result = 'FARA CAMPION'
    else:
        # Get teams with the highest score
        champion_teams = [str(i) for i, score in enumerate(team_scores[1:], 1) if score == highest_score]
        result = ' '.join(champion_teams) + f" {highest_score}"
    
    # Write results to 'concurs.out'
    with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(result + '\n')
```

This code should now correctly calculate the individual scores and the team scores, taking into account the requirement to ignore zero scores. When processing individual scores, it sums the values of non-zero digits in the score string. It then uses these scores to determine the max score and the number of contestants with that score for problem C=1, or to determine the champion team(s) and their score for problem C=2. It writes the appropriate result to 'concurs.out'.

The previous implementation is incorrect because it did not handle the concatenation of non-zero scores properly. In the problem statement, the individual score for a contestant is calculated by summing the digits of their concatenated non-zero scores, not by summing the individual scores themselves directly. Therefore, we need to adjust the logic to construct the concatenated score string correctly before summing its digits.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate individual and team scores
def calculate_scores(N, data):
    individual_scores = []
    team_scores = [0, 0, 0, 0]  # Team numbers are 1-based, so index 0 is unused

    for team, score_string in data:
        # Concatenate non-zero scores into a single string
        non_zero_scores = ''.join(ch for ch in score_string if ch != '0')
        # Calculate the individual total score by summing the digits of the concatenated string
        score = sum(int(digit) for digit in non_zero_scores) if non_zero_scores else 0
        individual_scores.append(score)
        team_scores[team] += score  # Update team score

    return individual_scores, team_scores

# Read data from file 'concurs.in'
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline())
    N = int(file.readline())
    # Parse contestant data
    contestants = [(int(team), file.readline().split()[1]) for team in range(N)]

# Calculate scores
individual_scores, team_scores = calculate_scores(N, contestants)

# Prepare the output based on the problem part
output = ""
if C == 1:
    # Find the max individual score and count of contestants with that score
    max_score = max(individual_scores)
    max_score_count = individual_scores.count(max_score)
    output = f"{max_score} {max_score_count}\n"
elif C == 2:
    # Identify the winning team(s)
    max_team_score = max(team_scores[1:])  # Skip index 0
    if max_team_score == 0:
        output = "FARA CAMPION\n"
    else:
        winning_teams = [str(team) for team, score in enumerate(team_scores) if score == max_team_score]
        output = ' '.join(winning_teams) + f" {max_team_score}\n"

# Write results to 'concurs.out'
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output)
```

This implementation properly constructs the concatenated score string for each contestant, taking into account only the non-zero scores. It then sums the digits of this string to calculate the individual total score. The overall team score is also correctly calculated by summing these individual scores. The output is then generated appropriately based on the problem part selected (C=1 or C=2) and written to 'concurs.out'.

The error `IndexError: list index out of range` is being thrown because the `team_scores` access index is out of the list's range. This could be happening because the construction of the `contestants` list is not being done correctly; it was intended to read `team` and `score_string` for each contestant, but in the loop, it's not iterating through the lines of file input correctly.

Let's fix the reading of the input data and the loop that parses the contestant data. After correcting this, I will also ensure that the team index is appropriately handled when updating the `team_scores`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate individual and team scores
def calculate_scores(N, data):
    individual_scores = []
    team_scores = [0, 0, 0, 0]  # Team numbers are 1-based, so index 0 is unused

    for team, score_string in data:
        # Concatenate non-zero scores into a single string
        non_zero_scores = ''.join(ch for ch in score_string if ch != '0')
        # Calculate the individual total score by summing the digits of the concatenated string
        score = sum(int(digit) for digit in non_zero_scores) if non_zero_scores else 0
        individual_scores.append(score)
        team_scores[team] += score  # Update team score

    return individual_scores, team_scores

# Read data from file 'concurs.in'
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Parse contestant data
    contestants = []
    for _ in range(N):
        line = file.readline().strip().split()
        team = int(line[0])
        score_string = line[1]
        contestants.append((team, score_string))

# Calculate scores
individual_scores, team_scores = calculate_scores(N, contestants)

# Prepare the output based on the problem part
output = ""
if C == 1:
    # Find the max individual score and count of contestants with that score
    max_score = max(individual_scores)
    max_score_count = individual_scores.count(max_score)
    output = f"{max_score} {max_score_count}\n"
elif C == 2:
    # Identify the winning team(s)
    max_team_score = max(team_scores[1:])  # Skip index 0
    if max_team_score == 0:
        output = "FARA CAMPION\n"
    else:
        winning_teams = [str(team) for team, score in enumerate(team_scores) if score == max_team_score and team > 0]
        output = ' '.join(winning_teams) + f" {max_team_score}\n"

# Write results to 'concurs.out'
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output)
```

This solution correctly reads the input file and parses the data into the `contestants` list. Then it calculates the scores for both individuals and teams, and depending on the value of C, it either calculates the max individual score and count or identifies the winning team(s). The result is written to the file 'concurs.out'.

The discrepancy between the expected and the actual output is due to a misunderstanding of the problem description regarding how a contestant's score is calculated. The problem statement says that a contestant's score is obtained by concatenating the nonzero scores from all the tests they took, not by summing the individual digits of those scores.

For example, if a contestant has scores "3101971", their total score is not the sum of all digits (3+1+0+1+9+7+1=22), but rather the concatenation of non-zero scores: "311971", which would mean their total score is 31.

Thus, the function `calculate_scores` needs to be changed to address this misconception. We need to concatenate the scores as strings, and then convert them to an integer to obtain the total score.

Let's correct the implementation:

```python
# Function to calculate individual and team scores
def calculate_scores(N, data):
    individual_scores = []
    team_scores = [0, 0, 0, 0]  # Team numbers are 1-based, so index 0 is unused

    for team, score_string in data:
        # Concatenate non-zero scores into a single string
        non_zero_scores = ''.join(ch for ch in score_string if ch != '0')
        # Convert non-zero concatenated scores to an integer total score
        total_score = int(non_zero_scores) if non_zero_scores else 0
        individual_scores.append(total_score)
        team_scores[team] += total_score  # Update team score

    return individual_scores, team_scores

# Read data from file 'concurs.in'
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Parse contestant data
    contestants = []
    for _ in range(N):
        team, score_string = file.readline().strip().split()
        contestants.append((int(team), score_string))

# Calculate scores
individual_scores, team_scores = calculate_scores(N, contestants)

# Prepare the output based on the problem part
output = ""
if C == 1:
    # Find the max individual score and count of contestants with that score
    max_score = max(individual_scores)
    max_score_count = individual_scores.count(max_score)
    output = f"{max_score} {max_score_count}\n"
elif C == 2:
    # Identify the winning team(s)
    max_team_score = max(team_scores[1:])  # Skip index 0
    if max_team_score == 0:
        output = "FARA CAMPION\n"
    else:
        winning_teams = [str(team) for team, score in enumerate(team_scores) if score == max_team_score and team > 0]
        output = ' '.join(winning_teams) + f" {max_team_score}\n"

# Write results to 'concurs.out'
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output)
```

This updated version should now produce the correct output. The code now concatenates nonzero scores and then converts that concatenated string into an integer to calculate the total score for each contestant. Finally, it performs the appropriate calculations based on whether C is 1 or 2 and outputs the result to 'concurs.out'.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to a misunderstanding of the scoring system. The expected output of `31 4` indicates that the highest score obtained by a single contestant is 31, and there are 4 contestants who achieved this score. However, the previous implementation of the scoring function incorrectly treated the concatenated non-zero scores as the total score, rather than correctly interpreting the concatenated string as a number to be summed.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate individual and team scores
def calculate_scores(N, data):
    individual_scores = []
    team_scores = [0, 0, 0, 0]  # Team numbers are 1-based, so index 0 is unused

    for team, score_string in data:
        # Concatenate non-zero scores into a single number
        non_zero_scores = ''.join(ch for ch in score_string if ch != '0')
        # Convert concatenated non-zero scores to an integer for total score
        total_score = int(non_zero_scores) if non_zero_scores else 0
        # Add individual score to the list
        individual_scores.append(total_score)
        # Add to the team's total score
        team_scores[team] += total_score

    return individual_scores, team_scores

# Read data from file 'concurs.in'
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Parse contestant data
    contestants = []
    for _ in range(N):
        team, score_string = file.readline().strip().split()
        contestants.append((int(team), score_string))

# Calculate scores
individual_scores, team_scores = calculate_scores(N, contestants)

# Prepare the output based on the problem part
output = ""
if C == 1:
    # Find the max individual score
    max_score = max(individual_scores)
    # Count the number of contestants with that score
    max_score_count = individual_scores.count(max_score)
    output = f"{max_score} {max_score_count}\n"
elif C == 2:
    # Identify the winning team(s)
    highest_team_score = max(team_scores[1:])  # Skip index 0
    if highest_team_score == 0:
        output = "FARA CAMPION\n"
    else:
        winning_teams = [str(team) for team, score in enumerate(team_scores) if score == highest_team_score and team > 0]
        output = ' '.join(winning_teams) + f" {highest_team_score}\n"

# Write results to 'concurs.out'
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output)
```

I realized that the function should be calculating the sum of the scores from the concatenated numbers, not just converting to a number. Let's correct that now:

```python
# Function to calculate individual and team scores
def calculate_scores(N, data):
    individual_scores = []
    team_scores = [0] * 4  # Indexes 1 to 3 for teams 1 to 3

    for team, scores in data:
        # Calculate total score by summing the digits of concatenated non-zero scores
        total_score = sum(int(s) for s in scores if s != '0')
        individual_scores.append(total_score)
        team_scores[team] += total_score

    return individual_scores, team_scores

# Read data from file 'concurs.in'
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline())
    N = int(file.readline())
    contestants = [(int(line.split()[0]), line.split()[1]) for line in file]

# Calculate scores
individual_scores, team_scores = calculate_scores(N, contestants)

# Prepare the output based on the problem part
output = ""
if C == 1:
    # Find the max individual score and count of contestants with that score
    max_score = max(individual_scores)
    max_score_count = individual_scores.count(max_score)
    output = f"{max_score} {max_score_count}\n"
elif C == 2:
    # Identify the winning team(s)
    max_team_score = max(team_scores[1:])  # Skip index 0
    if max_team_score == 0:
        output = "FARA CAMPION\n"
    else:
        winning_teams = [str(team) for team, score in enumerate(team_scores[1:], start=1) if score == max_team_score]
        output = ' '.join(winning_teams) + f" {max_team_score}\n"

# Write results to 'concurs.out'
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(output)
```

This implementation should correctly calculate the individual and team scores as specified in the problem statement and produce the correct output. The individual score is the sum of the digits from the concatenated non-zero scores, and the team scores are sums of their members' individual scores. The output is generated based on whether `C` is `1` or `2`, and is then written to the file 'concurs.out'.
