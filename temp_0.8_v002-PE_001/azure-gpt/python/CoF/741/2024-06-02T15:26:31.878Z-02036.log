O imagine va fi reprezentată ca un tablou dreptunghiular de numere reale, fiecare număr reprezentând o valoare pe scala de gri a imaginii. Valorile sunt cuprinse între $0$ (corespunzând unei regiuni total albe) și $1$ (pentru zona total neagră), cu două zecimale.
Centrul de gravitate al imaginii este un element al tabloului. Să presupunem că el se află pe linia $i$ și coloana $j$. Atunci diferența, în modul, dintre suma elementelor din zona aflată deasupra liniei $i$ și suma elementelor din zona aflată sub linia $i$, este minimă. În mod analog, pentru această diferență minimă, diferența, în modul, dintre suma elementelor din stânga coloanei $j$ și suma elementelor din dreapta coloanei $j$ trebuie să fie de asemenea minimă.
Să considerăm ca exemplu următorul tabloul care poate proveni din scanarea literei mici ‘o’. Centrul de gravitate este pe linia $3$ și coloana $3$, deoarece diferența sumelor elementelor din fiecare zonă formată ignorând linia a treia este $0.1$ (sumele sunt $5.55$ și $5.65$) și de asemenea, diferența sumelor elementelor fiecărei zone formate ignorând coloana a treia este $0.1$ (sumele sunt $5.60$ și $5.70$).

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să determine centrul de gravitate al unei imagini scanate.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul text de intrare `ocr.in` conține reprezentarea unei imagini. Prima linie a fișierului de intrare conține două valori naturale $n$ și $m$ separate printr-un spațiu reprezentând numărul de linii și respectiv numărul de coloane ale tabloului. Urmează $n$ linii, fiecare conținând câte $m$ numere reale din intervalul [$0, 1$] separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând imaginea scanată.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `ocr.out` va conține o singură linie pe care se găsesc două numere naturale $l$ și $c$, separate printr-un spațiu, reprezentând coordonatele (linie, coloană) centrului de gravitate. În cazul în care sunt determinate mai multe centre de gravitate, se vor afișa coordonatele celui cu indicele de linie maxim; dacă există mai multe centre de gravitate pe aceeași linie, se va afișa cel cu indicele de coloană maxim.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n, m \leq 50$;
* Valorile reale sunt exprimate cu maximum două zecimale
* Liniile sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $n$ (de sus în jos), iar coloanele de la $1$ la $m$ (de la stânga la dreapta).

lower_sums = total_sum_vertical - upper_sums
vertical_diffs = np.abs(upper_sums - lower_sums)
min_row_diff = np.min(vertical_diffs, axis=0)
rows_with_min_diff = np.where(vertical_diffs == min_row_diff)[0] + 1
selected_row = rows_with_min_diff[-1]  # Get the row with the maximum index

# Find the column with the minimum absolute difference
cumulative_sums_horizontal = np.cumsum(image, axis=1)
total_sum_horizontal = cumulative_sums_horizontal[:, -1]
left_sums = cumulative_sums_horizontal[:, :-1]  # Exclude the last sum, which is the total sum
right_sums = total_sum_horizontal[:, np.newaxis] - left_sums
horizontal_diffs = np.abs(left_sums - right_sums)
min_col_diff = np.min(horizontal_diffs, axis=1)
cols_with_min_diff = np.where(horizontal_diffs == min_col_diff[:, np.newaxis])[1] + 1
selected_col = cols_with_min_diff[selected_row - 1][-1]  # Get the column with the maximum index at the selected row

# Write the result to 'ocr.out'
with open('ocr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{selected_row} {selected_col}")
```

This solution takes advantage of NumPy's efficient array processing and in-memory operations to find the center of gravity for the image with minimal memory footprint and fast execution. The output is written to the 'ocr.out' file as required.

The provided error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the execution environment. Since the challenge requires us to use highly efficient libraries and `numpy` is one of the best choices for numerical computations in Python, we must continue without it.

I will now rewrite the solution to work without `numpy` or other external libraries, using only built-in Python features to ensure it is efficient in terms of both time and memory. The solution will still read from 'ocr.in' and write to 'ocr.out'.

```python
# Read data from 'ocr.in'
with open('ocr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    image = [list(map(float, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the row with the minimum absolute difference
row_sums = [sum(row) for row in image]
total_sum = sum(row_sums)
upper_sums = [sum(row_sums[:i]) for i in range(n)]
lower_sums = [total_sum - upper_sums[i] for i in range(n)]
row_diffs = [abs(upper_sums[i] - lower_sums[i]) for i in range(n)]
min_row_diff = min(row_diffs)
rows_with_min_diff = [i for i, diff in enumerate(row_diffs, 1) if diff == min_row_diff]
selected_row = rows_with_min_diff[-1]  # Get the row with the maximum index

# Find the column with the minimum absolute difference
col_sums = [sum(image[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]
total_sum = sum(col_sums)
left_sums = [sum(col_sums[:j]) for j in range(m)]
right_sums = [total_sum - left_sums[j] for j in range(m)]
col_diffs = [abs(left_sums[j] - right_sums[j]) for j in range(m)]
min_col_diff = min(col_diffs)
cols_with_min_diff = [j for j, diff in enumerate(col_diffs, 1) if diff == min_col_diff]
selected_col = cols_with_min_diff[-1]  # Get the column with the maximum index

# Write the result to 'ocr.out'
with open('ocr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{selected_row} {selected_col}")
```

This solution should now work without any external dependencies, using only built-in Python functions and data structures. It reads the image data from 'ocr.in', calculates the center of gravity, and writes the result to 'ocr.out' as specified. The use of list comprehensions and generator expressions also helps in minimizing memory usage, adhering to the 8MB limit.

Upon reviewing the solution, I have identified the issue with the calculation of the centers of gravity. The current implementation does not correctly calculate the differences between the upper/lower and left/right sums based on the center row/column. Instead, it calculates the sums as if the center was always at the first row or column. We need to update the algorithm to correctly calculate these sums for each possible center and compare them to find the center of gravity.

Here's the corrected solution that addresses these issues and maintains memory efficiency:

```python
# Read data from 'ocr.in'
with open('ocr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    image = [[float(x) for x in file.readline().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# Helper function to calculate cumulative sum
def cumulative_sum(arr):
    cumsum = [0]
    for num in arr:
        cumsum.append(cumsum[-1] + num)
    return cumsum

# Calculate cumulative sums for rows and columns
cumulative_rows = [cumulative_sum(row) for row in image]
cumulative_cols = cumulative_sum([sum(col) for col in zip(*image)])

# Find the row with the minimum absolute difference
min_row_diff = float('inf')
selected_row = -1
for i, row in enumerate(cumulative_rows):
    upper_sum = row[-1]
    lower_sum = cumulative_cols[-1] - upper_sum
    diff = abs(upper_sum - lower_sum)
    if diff < min_row_diff or (diff == min_row_diff and i+1 > selected_row):
        min_row_diff = diff
        selected_row = i + 1

# Find the column with the minimum absolute difference
min_col_diff = float('inf')
selected_col = -1
for j in range(m):
    left_sum = cumulative_cols[j]
    right_sum = cumulative_cols[-1] - left_sum
    diff = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
    if diff < min_col_diff or (diff == min_col_diff and j+1 > selected_col):
        min_col_diff = diff
        selected_col = j + 1

# Write the result to 'ocr.out'
with open('ocr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{selected_row} {selected_col}")
```

This corrected solution calculates the cumulative sum for each row and column, then iterates through each possible center row and column to find the corresponding upper/lower and left/right sums. It then calculates the absolute differences and updates the selected row and column while ensuring that it picks the ones with the maximum index in case of multiple centers with equal differences. The result is then written to 'ocr.out'.

This solution should now generate the correct output matching the expected result.

The issue with the previous solution is that it does not correctly consider the minimum difference in cumulative sums above and below each potential center line, as well as to the left and right of each potential center column. The algorithm should iterate over all possible center positions and compare the sums on each side of that center, finding the position with the smallest such difference.

Let's rewrite the solution to correctly calculate the center of gravity:

```python
# Read data from 'ocr.in'
with open('ocr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    image = [[float(x) for x in file.readline().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate prefix sums for rows and columns
prefix_sums_rows = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n)]
prefix_sums_cols = [0] * (m + 1)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        prefix_sums_rows[i][j + 1] = prefix_sums_rows[i][j] + image[i][j]
        prefix_sums_cols[j + 1] += image[i][j]

# Helper function to find the line with minimum absolute difference
def find_center_line(prefix_sums):
    total = prefix_sums[-1]
    min_diff = float('inf')
    center_line = -1
    for i, sum_at_line in enumerate(prefix_sums[:-1], start=1):
        upper_sum = sum_at_line
        lower_sum = total - upper_sum
        diff = abs(upper_sum - lower_sum)
        # Choose the line with the smallest difference, or the furthest down if tied
        if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i > center_line):
            min_diff = diff
            center_line = i
    return center_line

# Find the row and column with the minimum absolute difference
selected_row = find_center_line([row[-1] for row in prefix_sums_rows])
selected_col = find_center_line(prefix_sums_cols)

# Write the result to 'ocr.out'
with open('ocr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{selected_row} {selected_col}")
```

In this revised solution, we use a helper function `find_center_line` to find the row and column that serve as the center of gravity by calculating the cumulative sums above and below (for rows) or to the left and right (for columns) of each potential line, then finding the line with the smallest difference. The function also ensures that in case of a tie, the line with the largest index is selected. This should produce the correct output.

Upon reviewing the previous solution, I realize there is a problem with the way the center line is being identified. The center of gravity should be calculated by comparing the sum of values above and below each possible row, as well as the sum of values to the left and right of each possible column, considering all possible positions within the image, not just the edges.

Let's rewrite the solution to address the shortcomings:

```python
# Read data from 'ocr.in'
with open('ocr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    image = [[float(x) for x in file.readline().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# Function to calculate the center of gravity
def find_center_of_gravity(image, n, m):
    # Calculate the cumulative sum for rows and columns
    row_cumsum = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        row_cumsum[i] = row_cumsum[i - 1] + sum(image[i]) if i > 0 else sum(image[i])

    col_cumsum = [0] * m
    for j in range(m):
        col_cumsum[j] = col_cumsum[j - 1] + sum(image[i][j] for i in range(n)) if j > 0 else sum(image[i][j] for i in range(n))

    min_row_diff = float('inf')
    center_row = 0
    # Find the row with the minimum absolute difference between the sum of values above and below it
    for i in range(1, n):
        upper_sum = row_cumsum[i - 1]
        lower_sum = row_cumsum[n - 1] - upper_sum
        diff = abs(upper_sum - lower_sum)
        if diff <= min_row_diff:
            min_row_diff = diff
            center_row = i

    min_col_diff = float('inf')
    center_col = 0
    # Find the column with the minimum absolute difference between the sum of values to the left and right of it
    for j in range(1, m):
        left_sum = col_cumsum[j - 1]
        right_sum = col_cumsum[m - 1] - left_sum
        diff = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
        if diff <= min_col_diff:
            min_col_diff = diff
            center_col = j

    return center_row, center_col

selected_row, selected_col = find_center_of_gravity(image, n, m)

# Write the result to 'ocr.out'
with open('ocr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{selected_row} {selected_col}")
```

In this corrected solution, the `find_center_of_gravity` function calculates the center of gravity by iterating through the rows and columns and finding the row and column where the absolute difference of the sums is minimized. The function starts the search from index 1 (to match the problem's 1-based indexing) and includes the maximum index row or column in case of a tie in the difference. This should produce the correct output matching the expected result.

The issue with the previous versions of the solution is that they do not correctly calculate the sums for the parts of the image divided by a hypothetical center row and center column. We need to iterate through all possible center rows and center columns, calculate the sum of the values above and below the center row, and to the left and right of the center column, and then find the minimum absolute differences.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from 'ocr.in'
with open('ocr.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    image = [[float(x) for x in file.readline().split()] for _ in range(n)]

# Calculate the cumulative sum for each row and column
cumulative_rows = [sum(row) for row in image]
cumulative_columns = [sum(column) for column in zip(*image)]

# Function to find the center with minimum difference
def find_center(cumulative, length):
    min_diff = float('inf')
    center_index = -1
    for i in range(length):
        upper_sum = sum(cumulative[:i])
        lower_sum = cumulative[-1] - upper_sum
        diff = abs(upper_sum - lower_sum)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            center_index = i
        elif diff == min_diff and i > center_index:
            center_index = i
    return center_index + 1  # Convert to 1-based indexing

# Find the row and column with the minimum absolute difference
selected_row = find_center(cumulative_rows, n)
selected_col = find_center(cumulative_columns, m)

# Write the result to 'ocr.out'
with open('ocr.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{selected_row} {selected_col}")
```

This solution calculates the cumulative sum for rows and columns only once, and the `find_center` function iterates through the cumulative sums to find the center with the minimum difference, ensuring that the index with the highest value is used in case of ties. The output is then written to 'ocr.out'. This should now provide the correct output.

The previous attempts failed to correctly implement the logic for finding the center of gravity. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sums of each quadrant created by choosing each possible center and then find the center where the differences of these sums are minimized.

Here is the correct solution that should find the center of gravity as described in the problem:

```python
# Read data from 'ocr.in'
with open('ocr.in', 'r') as f:
    n, m = map(int, f.readline().split())
    image = [list(map(float, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the variables to track the minimum sum differences and the center indices
min_diff_row = float('inf')
min_diff_col = float('inf')
center_row = center_col = 0

# Calculate the cumulative sum for each row
cumulative_rows = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
    cumulative_rows[i] = sum(image[i]) if i == 0 else cumulative_rows[i-1] + sum(image[i])

# Calculate the cumulative sum for each column
cumulative_cols = [0] * m
for j in range(m):
    cumulative_cols[j] = sum(image[i][j] for i in range(n))
    if j > 0:
        cumulative_cols[j] += cumulative_cols[j-1]

# Find the row with the minimal difference between upper and lower sums
for i in range(1, n):
    upper_sum = cumulative_rows[i - 1]
    lower_sum = cumulative_rows[n - 1] - upper_sum
    diff = abs(upper_sum - lower_sum)
    if diff < min_diff_row:
        min_diff_row = diff
        center_row = i

# Find the column with the minimal difference between left and right sums
for j in range(1, m):
    left_sum = cumulative_cols[j - 1]
    right_sum = cumulative_cols[m - 1] - left_sum
    diff = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
    if diff < min_diff_col:
        min_diff_col = diff
        center_col = j

# Write the result to 'ocr.out'
with open('ocr.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{center_row + 1} {center_col + 1}")  # Convert to 1-based index
```

This code first calculates the cumulative sums for rows and columns, then iterates through potential center rows and columns, calculating the sum differences for the quadrants. It records the center row and column with the smallest differences. Centers are then output with a 1-based index as required. This should produce the expected result.
