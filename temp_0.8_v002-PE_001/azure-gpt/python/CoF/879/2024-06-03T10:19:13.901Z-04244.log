Un copil construiește un triunghi cu numerele naturale nenule astfel:

* în vârful triunghiului scrie valoarea $1$;
* completează liniile triunghiului de sus în jos, iar căsuțele de pe aceeași linie de la stânga la dreapta cu numere naturale consecutive, ca în figurile următoare.

~[numere.png]

În figura din stânga este ilustrat un astfel de triunghi având $5$ linii, conținând numerele naturale de la $1$ la $15$. În acest triunghi copilul începe să construiască drumuri, respectând următoarele reguli:

* orice drum începe din $1$;
* din orice căsuță se poate deplasa fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în stânga sa (deplasare codificată cu $1$), fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în dreapta sa (deplasare codficată cu $2$);
* orice drum va fi descris prin succesiunea deplasărilor efectuate.

De exemplu, drumul ilustrat în figura din dreapta poate fi descris astfel: $1$, $2$, $2$, $2$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care rezolvă următoarele două cerințe:

* citește descrierea unui drum și afișează numărul la care se termină drumul;
* citește un număr natural nenul $K$, determină un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$ pentru care suma numerelor prin care trece drumul este maximă și afișează această sumă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numere.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând cerința din problemă care trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$).

* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, a doua linie din fișier conține un număr natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea drumului, iar a treia linie din fișier conține descrierea drumului sub forma a $N$ valori, $1$ sau $2$, separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.
* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$, a doua linie din fișier conține numărul natural $K$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un singur număr natural. Dacă $C = 1$, va fi scris numărul cu care se termină drumul descris în fișierul de intrare. Dacă $C = 2$, va fi scrisă suma maximă a numerelor aflate pe un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $40$ de puncte; pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $50$ de puncte. $10$ puncte se acordă din oficiu.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read the file content
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())

if C == 1:
    N = int(lines[1].strip())
    moves = np.fromstring(lines[2].strip(), dtype=int, sep=' ')

    # Initialize variables for tracking the position
    pos, level_sum = 1, 1

    # Calculate the final number after following the moves
    for move in moves:
        level_sum += pos
        if move == 1:
            pos += 1
        else:
            pos += 2

    # Write the final number to the file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(level_sum))

else:
    K = int(lines[1].strip())

    # To find the maximum sum, we need to take the longest path to K which
    # implies taking as many left moves (1) as possible from the root.
    # First, we need to find the level of K in the triangle.

    # Find the level of K in the triangle
    level = int(np.ceil((-1 + np.sqrt(1 + 8 * K)) / 2))
    max_sum = K

    # Calculate the number that would be at the leftmost position at this level
    leftmost_number_at_level = (level * (level - 1)) // 2 + 1

    # The difference between K and the leftmost number gives us the number
    # of right moves (2). We subtract this many from the level to find out
    # how many 1 moves we can make.
    right_moves = K - leftmost_number_at_level

    # Calculate the sum of the longest path to K
    for i in range(1, level - right_moves):
        max_sum += i

    # Write the maximum sum to the file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

Make sure the file `numere.in` is present with the required input before running this script. The script reads from `numere.in` and writes the result into `numere.out` as specified. The solution uses `numpy` for efficient numerical computations, keeping in mind the memory constraints.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed or not available in the current environment. Since the problem requires optimizing for memory and it is stated that the solution should utilize numpy, there might be a misunderstanding. If we are running this in an environment where we cannot install numpy, we need to avoid using it.

Here is the revised solution that does not use `numpy` and ensures low memory usage:

```python
# Function to find the level of K in the triangle
def find_level(K):
    level = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        level += 1
    return level

# Function to calculate the sum of the longest path to K
def calculate_max_sum(K, level):
    max_sum = K
    # Calculate the number that would be at the leftmost position at this level
    leftmost_number_at_level = ((level - 1) * level) // 2 + 1
    # The difference between K and the leftmost number gives us the number
    # of right moves (2). We subtract this many from the level to find out
    # how many 1 moves we can make.
    right_moves = K - leftmost_number_at_level
    # Add the numbers from the longest path
    for i in range(1, level - right_moves):
        max_sum += i
    return max_sum

# Read the file content
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())

if C == 1:
    N = int(lines[1].strip())
    moves = list(map(int, lines[2].strip().split()))

    # Initialize variables for tracking the position
    pos, level_sum = 1, 1

    # Calculate the final number after following the moves
    for move in moves:
        level_sum += pos
        if move == 1:
            pos += 1
        else:
            pos += 2

    # Write the final number to the file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(level_sum))

else:
    K = int(lines[1].strip())

    level = find_level(K)
    max_sum = calculate_max_sum(K, level)

    # Write the maximum sum to the file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This code should work without the need for any external libraries, including numpy, and handles both parts of the challenge as per the specifications.

Upon reviewing the current solution for task 2, I realize that the algorithm to calculate the maximum sum of the path leading to the number K is incorrect. The algorithm incorrectly calculates the sum as if only taking the longest path to K by going all the way to the left and then moving right, but the challenge specifies that we need to find the maximum sum path, which may include moving right earlier on the path and then moving left again to reach K. 

To fix this, we must change our strategy. The path with the maximum sum to a number K on level L of the triangle is the path that stays at the leftmost position as long as possible before moving right to reach K. This means the path would consist mostly of 1s (left moves) and then 2s (right moves) at the end.

To find the sum of the maximum path, we'll calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to the number at the leftmost position at K's level and then deduct the sum of all the numbers from 1 to the number at the leftmost position at the level just before the path starts to move right.

Here is the correct solution:

```python
# Helper function to calculate the sum of arithmetic sequence from 1 to n
def sum_of_sequence(n):
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2

# Read the file content
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())

if C == 1:
    N = int(lines[1].strip())
    moves = list(map(int, lines[2].strip().split()))

    # Initialize variables for tracking the position
    pos = 1

    # Calculate the final number after following the moves
    for move in moves:
        pos += move

    # Write the final number to the file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(pos))

else:
    K = int(lines[1].strip())

    # Find the level of K and the leftmost number at that level
    level = find_level(K)
    leftmost_number_at_level = sum_of_sequence(level - 1) + 1

    # Calculate the number of right moves needed to reach K from the leftmost position
    right_moves = K - leftmost_number_at_level

    # Calculate the sum of numbers up to the leftmost position at K's level
    sum_to_K_level = sum_of_sequence(leftmost_number_at_level + right_moves)

    # Calculate the sum of numbers that we effectively skip by moving right
    skipped_sum = sum_of_sequence(right_moves)

    # The maximum sum path is the difference between the two sums calculated
    max_sum = sum_to_K_level - skipped_sum

    # Write the maximum sum to the file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This code calculates the sum of the path with the maximum sum leading to the number K correctly, and it should provide the expected output.

The previous solution for task 1 is incorrect because it simply adds the value of the move to the position, which does not account for the correct numbering of the triangle. The numbering increases by the level index for each step to the right, and by the level index minus one for each step to the left. We need to take this into account to find the correct number at the end of the path.

Let's fix the solution for both task 1 and task 2. For task 1, we will calculate the correct position by incrementing the current value based on the level we are on. For task 2, we will correct the algorithm to calculate the maximum sum path to K, keeping in mind that the leftmost number at level L is L(L+1)/2 + 1, and the sum of numbers 1 to n is n(n+1)/2.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Function to find the sum of the maximum path to K
def calculate_max_sum(K):
    level = 1
    current_number = 1
    while K > current_number + level:
        current_number += level
        level += 1
    # At this point, 'current_number' is the first number of the 'level' row
    # Now, we need to calculate the maximum path sum to K
    max_sum = current_number
    while current_number < K:
        max_sum += level
        current_number += 1
    return max_sum

# Read from the input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())

if C == 1:
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line, as we already have C
        N = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    number = 1  # Starting at the top of the triangle
    level = 1  # The top of the triangle is considered level 1

    # Follow the path described by 'moves' to find the end number
    for move in moves:
        number += level if move == 2 else level - 1
        level += 1  # Moving to the next level

    # Write to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(number))

else:
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line, as we already have C
        K = int(file.readline().strip())

    # Calculate the maximum sum path to K
    max_sum = calculate_max_sum(K)

    # Write to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

Now this solution should correctly solve both tasks 1 and 2 of the challenge. Task 1 now follows the correct path by recognizing the pattern of the numbering in the triangle, and task 2 calculates the maximum sum by taking the longest path possible to the left before moving right to K.

The error message you are seeing (`docker: Error response from daemon: cannot start a stopped process: unknown`) does not relate to the Python code itself. Instead, it seems to be an issue with the Docker container in which the Python code is being executed. This could be due to a variety of Docker-related issues such as problems with the container configuration, insufficient resources, or an issue with the Docker daemon.

Since the error is not directly related to the Python code, we cannot fix it within the Python code. However, we can ensure that the Python code provided earlier is correct and will run successfully in a properly configured Python environment.

Let's provide a Python-only solution without any external dependencies for both tasks. I will rewrite the entire solution applying the necessary fixes for the Python code:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of an arithmetic progression
def sum_of_progression(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Read the command and data from the input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    data = int(file.readline().strip())

if C == 1:
    # Task 1: Find the end number of a given path
    moves = []
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line (C)
        file.readline()  # Skip the second line (data - length of the path)
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    position = 1
    for level, move in enumerate(moves, start=2):
        position += level if move == 2 else (level - 1)

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(position))

elif C == 2:
    # Task 2: Find the maximum sum path to number K
    level = 1
    while data > sum_of_progression(level):
        level += 1
    # Now, find the maximum sum path to K
    sum_to_K = sum_of_progression(level)  # Sum of all numbers up to level
    first_number_in_level = sum_of_progression(level - 1) + 1
    diff = data - first_number_in_level
    # Subtract the sum of all the numbers skipped by moving right too early
    subtracted_sum = sum_of_progression(diff) if diff > 0 else 0
    max_sum = sum_to_K - subtracted_sum + data

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This solution reads the input from `numere.in` and writes the output to `numere.out`. It handles both tasks correctly using only built-in Python functionality, ensuring compatibility with a standard Python environment without the need for docker or other dependencies.

The code should be run in a properly set up Python environment. If the Docker issue persists, you may need to seek assistance from someone with Docker expertise to resolve the container or daemon issue.

The error in the expected versus found output for task 2 suggests that the maximum sum path calculation is incorrect. The task is to determine a path that ends at the specified number K, and the path must have the maximum possible sum. The mistake in the previous code lies in the calculation of the maximum sum path to K. The path with the maximum sum to a specific number K will not be the path that reaches the leftmost number at K's level and then proceeds directly to K. Instead, it will be the path that stays on the left edge of the triangle as long as possible before moving to the right to reach K.

Let's correct the solution for task 2. To achieve this, we must first find the level where K is located. We already know that the first number of level L is the L-th triangular number, which is given by L*(L+1)/2. Once we find the level of K, we need to find the maximum sum path that reaches K, which involves staying on the left edge of the triangle for as long as possible and then moving to the right to reach K.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
# Function to find the level of number K in the triangle
def find_level(K):
    level = 1
    num_in_level = level * (level + 1) // 2
    while num_in_level < K:
        level += 1
        num_in_level = level * (level + 1) // 2
    return level

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path to K
def calculate_max_sum(K, level):
    # Calculate the sum of the numbers on the left edge up to level
    max_sum = (level * (level - 1) // 2) * level
    # Find the position of K in the level
    position_in_level = K - ((level - 1) * level // 2)
    # Starting from the leftmost number, add the numbers up to K
    for i in range(1, position_in_level):
        max_sum += level - 1 + i
    # Add K itself
    max_sum += K
    return max_sum

# Read from the input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    data = int(file.readline().strip())

if C == 1:
    # Task 1: Find the end number of a given path
    moves = []
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line (C)
        file.readline()  # Skip the second line (data - length of the path)
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    position = 1  # Start from the top of the triangle
    for i, move in enumerate(moves, start=1):
        position += i if move == 2 else (i + 1)

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(position))

elif C == 2:
    # Task 2: Find the maximum sum path to number K
    level = find_level(data)
    max_sum = calculate_max_sum(data, level)

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This solution should now provide the correct output for the given input in task 2, as well as correct the task 1 path calculation.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output indicates a flaw in the calculation of the maximum sum path for task 2.

The task at hand requires calculating the maximum sum of a path ending at number K. The maximum sum path will always stay to the left as much as possible because numbers on the left are smaller, and thus the sum of the path increases with every step down-left. The only time the path should go down-right is to make the final move to the number K.

To find the sum of the maximum sum path, we have to calculate two things:

1. The sum of numbers from 1 to the "parent" of K. The "parent" of K is the number above K and to the left in the triangle, which we can find by subtracting the row number from K.
2. The sum of numbers from the first number in the triangle to the "parent" of K. 

The maximum path sum will be the total of these two sums plus K itself.

Let's correct the implementation:

```python
# Function to find the level (row) of number K in the triangle
def find_level(K):
    level = 1
    while K > level:
        K -= level
        level += 1
    return level

# Function to find the first number in a given level (row)
def first_number_in_level(level):
    return (level - 1) * level // 2 + 1

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path to K
def calculate_max_sum(K, level):
    # Calculate the sum of the path staying to the left as much as possible
    max_sum = sum(range(1, first_number_in_level(level)))
    # Calculate the number of steps to the right to reach K
    steps_right = K - first_number_in_level(level)
    # Add the numbers from the path that moves right to K
    parent = first_number_in_level(level)  # The "parent" of K
    for _ in range(steps_right):
        parent += level
        max_sum += parent
        level += 1
    return max_sum

# Read from the input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    data = int(file.readline().strip())

if C == 1:
    # Task 1: Find the end number of a given path
    with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip the first line
        file.readline()  # Skip the second line
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

    position = 1  # Start from the top of the triangle
    level = 1
    for move in moves:
        level += 1
        position += level if move == 2 else level - 1

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(position))

elif C == 2:
    # Task 2: Find the maximum sum path to number K
    level = find_level(data)
    max_sum = calculate_max_sum(data, level)

    # Write the result to the output file
    with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(max_sum))
```

This solution should now provide the correct output for the given input in task 2, as well as task 1. The `calculate_max_sum` function has been corrected to calculate the path correctly, creating a path that stays to the left as much as possible before moving to the right to reach K.
