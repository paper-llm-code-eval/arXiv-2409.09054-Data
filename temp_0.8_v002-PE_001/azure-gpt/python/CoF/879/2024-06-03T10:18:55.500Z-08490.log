Un copil construiește un triunghi cu numerele naturale nenule astfel:

* în vârful triunghiului scrie valoarea $1$;
* completează liniile triunghiului de sus în jos, iar căsuțele de pe aceeași linie de la stânga la dreapta cu numere naturale consecutive, ca în figurile următoare.

~[numere.png]

În figura din stânga este ilustrat un astfel de triunghi având $5$ linii, conținând numerele naturale de la $1$ la $15$. În acest triunghi copilul începe să construiască drumuri, respectând următoarele reguli:

* orice drum începe din $1$;
* din orice căsuță se poate deplasa fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în stânga sa (deplasare codificată cu $1$), fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în dreapta sa (deplasare codficată cu $2$);
* orice drum va fi descris prin succesiunea deplasărilor efectuate.

De exemplu, drumul ilustrat în figura din dreapta poate fi descris astfel: $1$, $2$, $2$, $2$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care rezolvă următoarele două cerințe:

* citește descrierea unui drum și afișează numărul la care se termină drumul;
* citește un număr natural nenul $K$, determină un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$ pentru care suma numerelor prin care trece drumul este maximă și afișează această sumă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numere.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând cerința din problemă care trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$).

* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, a doua linie din fișier conține un număr natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea drumului, iar a treia linie din fișier conține descrierea drumului sub forma a $N$ valori, $1$ sau $2$, separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.
* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$, a doua linie din fișier conține numărul natural $K$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un singur număr natural. Dacă $C = 1$, va fi scris numărul cu care se termină drumul descris în fișierul de intrare. Dacă $C = 2$, va fi scrisă suma maximă a numerelor aflate pe un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $40$ de puncte; pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $50$ de puncte. $10$ puncte se acordă din oficiu.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found. This likely means that `numpy` is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since we also have a strict memory limit and should optimize for both time and memory, it might be more efficient to avoid using `numpy` and rely solely on standard Python libraries to manage memory more carefully.

Let's rewrite the solution without using `numpy` and optimize the solution primarily using Python's standard libraries.

```python
# Function to calculate the position of K in its row
def find_position(k):
    # Find the row where the number K is located
    row = int(((-1 + (1 + 8 * k)**0.5) / 2))
    # Calculate the start of the row
    start_of_row = row * (row - 1) // 2 + 1
    # The position of K in the row is the difference between K and the start of the row
    position = k - start_of_row
    return row, position

# Function to calculate the sum of the maximum path ending with K
def max_path_sum(k):
    row, position = find_position(k)
    # The maximum sum is the sum of the first row elements plus the sum of the row elements up to 'position'
    sum_of_first_elements = row * (row - 1) // 2
    max_sum = sum_of_first_elements + position * (position + 1) // 2
    return max_sum

# Function to find the ending number of a path described by moves
def path_end(n, moves):
    row = 1
    position = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        if move == 2:
            position += 1
    # Find the start of the row
    start_of_row = row * (row - 1) // 2 + 1
    # Calculate the number at the end of the path
    end_number = start_of_row + position - 1
    return end_number

# Read from 'numere.in'
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())

    if c == 1:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        result = path_end(n, moves)

        result = max_path_sum(k)

# Write to 'numere.out'
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:

This code should no longer produce the `ModuleNotFoundError` since it doesn't use `numpy`. Additionally, it optimizes memory usage by avoiding large data structures and using standard Python math operations.

The provided output for the input data "2 9" indicates that the sum of the maximum path ending with the number 9 is expected to be 19, but the program provided a sum of 18. 

Upon reviewing the `max_path_sum` function, it seems like the maximum sum is being calculated incorrectly. For the maximum path, we need to consider that when we move to the right, we take the next number in the row, but when we move to the left, we stay with the same number for that row. Therefore, we must adjust the sum calculation to consider this.

Let's reimplement `max_path_sum` to correctly calculate the maximum sum by considering that the left moves do not change the sum:

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of the maximum path ending with K
def max_path_sum(k):
    row, position = find_position(k)
    # The maximum sum for each row should be the sum of the first 'row' numbers
    # since moving left (which is the optimal move) keeps the sum unchanged,
    # and moving right adds 'row' to the sum.
    sum_of_first_elements = row * (row - 1) // 2
    max_sum = sum_of_first_elements + (row - 1) + (position + 1) * (row - position) // 2
    return max_sum

# Fix the find_position function to return the correct position
def find_position(k):
    # Use integer arithmetic to find the row
    row, start_of_row = 1, 1
    while k > start_of_row + row - 1:
        row += 1
        start_of_row += row - 1
    # The position of K in the row is the difference between K and the start of the row plus one
    position = k - start_of_row + 1
    return row, position

# The path_end function looks correct; no changes needed there.

# Read from 'numere.in', process the input, and write to 'numere.out' as before:
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())

    if c == 1:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        result = path_end(n, moves)
    elif c == 2:
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        result = max_path_sum(k)

with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This updated solution should now correctly calculate the sum of the maximum path ending with the number K by accounting for the fact that left moves do not change the sum, and should match the expected output.

The error message indicates that the `path_end` function is not defined, which suggests that I accidentally indicated that no changes were needed there, but the function was actually not included in the final code snippet. Let's fix this by including the `path_end` function and correct the implementation of `max_path_sum`. The error in calculating the maximum path sum was due to not correctly calculating the sum of numbers on the path when moving left, which does not change the cumulative sum.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the ending number of a path described by moves
def path_end(n, moves):
    row = 1
    position = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        if move == 2:
            position += 1
    # Find the start of the row
    start_of_row = row * (row - 1) // 2 + 1
    # Calculate the number at the end of the path
    end_number = start_of_row + position - 1
    return end_number

# Function to calculate the sum of the maximum path ending with K
def max_path_sum(k):
    row, position = find_position(k)
    # The maximum sum path to K will involve always taking the right turn to maximize the sum
    # which is equivalent to always taking the left turn and then adding the additional numbers skipped.
    left_turns_sum = (row * (row - 1)) // 2
    right_turns_sum = (position * (position - 1)) // 2
    max_sum = left_turns_sum + k + right_turns_sum
    return max_sum

# Function to find the row and position of K within the row
def find_position(k):
    row = 1
    end_of_row = 1
    # Increment row until we find the row that contains K
    while k > end_of_row:
        row += 1
        end_of_row += row
    # Calculate start of the row
    start_of_row = end_of_row - row + 1
    # Find the position of K in the row
    position = k - start_of_row + 1
    return row, position

# Read from 'numere.in'
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())

    if c == 1:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        result = path_end(n, moves)
    elif c == 2:
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        result = max_path_sum(k)

# Write to 'numere.out'
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This code includes the `path_end` function and corrects the logic in `max_path_sum` to appropriately calculate the maximum path sum. It should give the correct output without encountering the `NameError`.

Upon reviewing the `max_path_sum` function given the input where K is 9 and the expected output is 19, it appears that the logic to calculate the maximum path sum is still incorrect. Let's analyze the problem again and correct the logic.

To find the sum of the maximum path ending with K, we should consider that we want the path to stay on the rightmost side as much as possible, because the numbers on the right are always larger than those on the left for any given row. However, we also have to consider the triangle structure, which doesn't allow us to move right indefinitely. 

Here is the corrected logic for the `max_path_sum` function:

1. Find the row and position of K within that row using the `find_position` function.
2. The maximum possible sum of the path is achieved by starting at the top (1) and always going to the right until we reach the right edge of the triangle, then going down-left towards the target number K.

Let's reimplement the `find_position` and `max_path_sum` functions with this correct logic:

```python
# Function to find the row and position of K within the row
def find_position(k):
    row, acc = 1, 1
    while acc + row < k:
        acc += row
        row += 1
    position = k - acc
    return row, position

# Function to calculate the sum of the maximum path ending with K
def max_path_sum(k):
    row, position = find_position(k)
    # Calculate the sum of the path that goes all the way right until the last row before K's row
    # Then goes left until it reaches K's position
    sum_down_right = sum([i*(i+1)//2 for i in range(1, row)])
    sum_down_left = sum([row+i for i in range(position)])
    max_sum = sum_down_right + sum_down_left
    return max_sum

# The path_end function remains the same as before

# Read from 'numere.in', process the input, and write to 'numere.out':
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())

    if c == 1:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        result = path_end(n, moves)
    elif c == 2:
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        result = max_path_sum(k)

with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This implementation should now calculate the maximum path sum correctly while respecting the constraints of the problem. It takes into account the triangular structure when calculating the sum and finds the most efficient path that results in the highest sum ending at number K.

The error message indicates that the `path_end` function is not defined, which means that this function is not present in the current code context. This was possibly a mistake in copy-pasting or omitting the function in the solution.

In order to fix the problem, I will now include the `path_end` function, and I will also correct the logic in `max_path_sum` as per the earlier explanation. The `max_path_sum` function should calculate the maximum sum for any path that ends in `K` by taking the rightmost path as much as possible before going left to the final number `K`.

Here is the revised and complete solution:

```python
# Function to find the row and position of K within the row
def find_position(k):
    row = 1
    while k > row:
        k -= row
        row += 1
    return row, k

# Function to calculate the sum of the maximum path ending with K
def max_path_sum(k):
    row, position = find_position(k)
    # For maximum sum, we stay at the rightmost edge as long as possible
    # The rightmost numbers on each row form the sequence of triangular numbers
    # Triangular numbers are given by n(n+1)/2, so we sum those up to row-1
    # Then we add the sequence from the right edge to the position of K
    sum_right_edge = sum((i * (i + 1)) // 2 for i in range(1, row))
    sum_to_k = sum(range(sum_right_edge - row + 2, sum_right_edge - row + position + 1))
    return sum_right_edge + sum_to_k

# Function to find the ending number of a path described by moves
def path_end(n, moves):
    row = 1
    position = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        position += move - 1
    # Calculate the number at the end of the path
    start_of_row = (row * (row - 1)) // 2 + 1
    end_number = start_of_row + position - 1
    return end_number

# Read from 'numere.in', process the input, and write to 'numere.out':
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())

    if c == 1:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        result = path_end(n, moves)
    elif c == 2:
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        result = max_path_sum(k)

with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This corrected version includes the `path_end` function and corrects the calculation of `max_path_sum` by using triangular numbers and summing up to the position on the right edge before moving left to the final number `K`. The code should now work as expected without encountering a `NameError` and produce the correct output.

The expected output for the input "2 9" is 19, but the returned output is 27, indicating that the `max_path_sum` function's logic is incorrect. To correct this issue, let's revise our approach:

For the maximum sum path to any number K, we need to consider the pyramid structure. As we start at the top, we have a choice at each step to move either left or right (which is represented by the movement coded as 1 and 2 respectively). To maximize the sum, we need to move to the right as much as possible because the numbers increase to the right. However, we cannot move to the right more times than the row number of K minus one.

Here is the corrected logic:

1. Calculate the row number of K.
2. Find the maximum number of times we can move right without passing K.
3. Calculate the sum by considering moving right the maximum number of times until reaching the row of K, then move left to reach K.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the row number and position within that row for number K
def calc_row_and_position(K):
    row = 1
    while K > row:
        K -= row
        row += 1
    position = K
    return row, position

# Function to calculate the sum of the maximum path ending with K
def max_path_sum(K):
    row, position = calc_row_and_position(K)
    # The sum of the path will be the sum of numbers from 1 to the number at the start of the row
    # plus the extra amount added by moving to the right, which is the difference between K's position and 1
    # multiplied by the row number (since moving right from a position i to position i+1 on row r adds r to the sum).
    sum_until_row = row * (row - 1) // 2
    extra_from_moving_right = (position - 1) * row
    max_sum = sum_until_row + extra_from_moving_right + K
    return max_sum

# Function to find the ending number of a path described by moves
def path_end(n, moves):
    row = 1
    position = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        if move == 2:  # Moving right
            position += 1
    # Calculate the number at the end of the path
    start_of_row = (row * (row - 1)) // 2 + 1
    end_number = start_of_row + position - 1
    return end_number

# Read from 'numere.in', process the input, and write to 'numere.out':
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())

    if c == 1:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))
        result = path_end(n, moves)
    elif c == 2:
        k = int(file.readline().strip())
        result = max_path_sum(k)

with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution should now correctly find the sum of the maximum path to K by considering the pyramid structure and the number of right moves that can be made to maximize the sum.
