Un copil construiește un triunghi cu numerele naturale nenule astfel:

* în vârful triunghiului scrie valoarea $1$;
* completează liniile triunghiului de sus în jos, iar căsuțele de pe aceeași linie de la stânga la dreapta cu numere naturale consecutive, ca în figurile următoare.

~[numere.png]

În figura din stânga este ilustrat un astfel de triunghi având $5$ linii, conținând numerele naturale de la $1$ la $15$. În acest triunghi copilul începe să construiască drumuri, respectând următoarele reguli:

* orice drum începe din $1$;
* din orice căsuță se poate deplasa fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în stânga sa (deplasare codificată cu $1$), fie în căsuța situată pe linia următoare în dreapta sa (deplasare codficată cu $2$);
* orice drum va fi descris prin succesiunea deplasărilor efectuate.

De exemplu, drumul ilustrat în figura din dreapta poate fi descris astfel: $1$, $2$, $2$, $2$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care rezolvă următoarele două cerințe:

* citește descrierea unui drum și afișează numărul la care se termină drumul;
* citește un număr natural nenul $K$, determină un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$ pentru care suma numerelor prin care trece drumul este maximă și afișează această sumă.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numere.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând cerința din problemă care trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$).

* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $1$, a doua linie din fișier conține un număr natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea drumului, iar a treia linie din fișier conține descrierea drumului sub forma a $N$ valori, $1$ sau $2$, separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.
* Dacă $C$ este egal cu $2$, a doua linie din fișier conține numărul natural $K$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` va conține o singură linie pe care va fi scris un singur număr natural. Dacă $C = 1$, va fi scris numărul cu care se termină drumul descris în fișierul de intrare. Dacă $C = 2$, va fi scrisă suma maximă a numerelor aflate pe un drum care se termină cu numărul $K$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq K \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $1$ se acordă $40$ de puncte; pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinței $2$ se acordă $50$ de puncte. $10$ puncte se acordă din oficiu.

The error suggests that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the program is being executed. Since we cannot use `numpy` and must keep memory usage low, I will revise the solution to use plain Python without any external libraries.

Here's the complete solution, rewritten to avoid using `numpy`:

```python
# Function to identify the row number in the triangle given an index
def find_row(index):
    # Using quadratic formula to solve n(n+1)/2 = index for n
    row = int(((-1 + (1 + 8 * index) ** 0.5) / 2))
    return row

# Function to generate the sum of the triangle numbers up to a certain row
def triangle_sums(row):
    return row * (row + 1) * (row + 2) // 6

# Function to find the end number of a path
def end_number_of_path(length, moves):
    row = 1
    pos = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        pos += move - 1
    return triangle_sums(row - 1) + pos

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path for a given end number
def max_sum_path_to_end_number(k):
    row = find_row(k)
    pos = k - triangle_sums(row - 1)
    max_sum = k
    # Construct path from bottom to top
    while row > 1:
        if pos > row // 2:
            # Choose the right side
            pos -= 1
            max_sum += triangle_sums(row - 1) + pos
        else:
            # Choose the left side
            max_sum += triangle_sums(row - 2) + pos
        row -= 1
    return max_sum

# Read input

    lines = f.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:

        moves = list(map(int, lines[2].strip().split()))
    else:

The provided solution incorrectly calculates the end number of the path. The function `end_number_of_path` is intended to follow the series of moves described in the input, where `1` represents a move to the left on the next row and `2` represents a move to the right on the next row. However, the current implementation is not correctly following this logic.

Here's the correct implementation of the function `end_number_of_path`, which calculates the position in the triangle by following the moves described:

```python
# Function to find the end number of a path
def end_number_of_path(length, moves):
    index = 1 # Start at the top of the triangle
    for row, move in enumerate(moves, start=2): # Start at row 2
        if move == 1:
            index += row - 1
        elif move == 2:
            index += row
    return index
```

Additionally, we need to correct the calculation of the maximum sum path for a given end number `K`. We must carefully backtrack from `K` to find which moves would have resulted in the maximum sum path. Here's the correct implementation:

```python
# Function to calculate the maximum sum path for a given end number
def max_sum_path_to_end_number(k):
    row = find_row(k)
    index = k
    max_sum = k
    # Backtrack the path from the target index `k` to the top of the triangle
    while row > 1:
        left_parent = index - row
        right_parent = left_parent - 1
        if right_parent - (row - 1) * (row - 2) // 2 > 0:  # Check if the right parent exists in the triangle
            max_sum += right_parent
            index = right_parent
        else:
            max_sum += left_parent
            index = left_parent
        row -= 1
    return max_sum
```

Let's rewrite the entire solution with these corrections:

```python
# Function to identify the row number in the triangle given an index
def find_row(index):
    # Using quadratic formula to solve n(n+1)/2 = index for n
    row = int(((-1 + (1 + 8 * index) ** 0.5) / 2))
    return row

# Function to find the end number of a path
def end_number_of_path(length, moves):
    index = 1 # Start at the top of the triangle
    for row, move in enumerate(moves, start=2): # Start at row 2
        if move == 1:
            index += row - 1
        elif move == 2:
            index += row
    return index

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path for a given end number
def max_sum_path_to_end_number(k):
    row = find_row(k)
    index = k
    max_sum = k
    # Backtrack the path from the target index `k` to the top of the triangle
    while row > 1:
        left_parent = index - row
        right_parent = left_parent - 1
        if right_parent - (row - 1) * (row - 2) // 2 > 0:  # Check if the right parent exists in the triangle
            max_sum += right_parent
            index = right_parent
        else:
            max_sum += left_parent
            index = left_parent
        row -= 1
    return max_sum

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(lines[1].strip())
        moves = list(map(int, lines[2].strip().split()))
    else:
        K = int(lines[1].strip())

# Perform task based on input C
if C == 1:
    result = end_number_of_path(N, moves)
else:
    result = max_sum_path_to_end_number(K)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as f:

The previous implementation in `max_sum_path_to_end_number` still contains a logical error. This function should find a path that results in the maximum sum ending at `K`, but the backtracking step uses incorrect logic to determine the parent nodes.

Let's analyze the problem again and come up with a new approach:

1. To calculate the maximum sum path to a given end number `K`, we start from `K` and move upwards to the top of the triangle.
2. At each step moving upwards, we have two potential parent positions to choose from: the left parent or the right parent. The left parent is located at `index - row` and the right parent is at `index - row + 1`.
3. We know that in the triangle, numbers increase from left to right on each row. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we should always choose the rightmost possible path when backtracking from `K`.
4. This means, if the end number `K` is on the right half of the row (including the middle if the row has an odd number of elements), we choose the right parent; otherwise, we choose the left parent.

Let's rewrite the function `max_sum_path_to_end_number` using this new logic.

```python
# Function to find the end number of a path
def end_number_of_path(length, moves):
    index = 1  # The top of the triangle
    row = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        if move == 1:
            index += (row - 1)
        else:  # move == 2
            index += row
    return index

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path for a given end number
def max_sum_path_to_end_number(k):
    row = find_row(k)
    index = k
    max_sum = k
    while row > 1:
        prev_row_last_index = (row - 1) * row // 2
        middle = (prev_row_last_index + (prev_row_last_index - row + 2)) // 2
        if index > middle:  # Choose the right parent
            index = index - row + 1
        else:  # Choose the left parent
            index = index - row
        max_sum += index
        row -= 1
    return max_sum

# Function to find row given an index in the triangle
def find_row(index):
    row = 1
    while index > row:
        index -= row
        row += 1
    return row

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(f.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split()))
        result = end_number_of_path(N, moves)
    elif C == 2:
        K = int(f.readline().strip())
        result = max_sum_path_to_end_number(K)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result) + "\n")
```

This implementation fixes the logical error in backtracking the parent position when finding the maximum sum path to `K`. It should provide the expected output for both types of problems described in the challenge.

The calculated output for the second challenge (C=2) is incorrect because the logic to determine the maximum sum path to a given end number `K` is flawed. The correct logic is to always choose the larger value from the two potential parent positions at each step while going upwards in the triangle. Since the triangle is built with consecutive numbers increasing from left to right, the parent on the right side will always have a greater value than the parent on the left side for the same row.

Let's re-evaluate the maximum sum path logic:

1. Given an end number `K` at row `R`, we can find its position within that row as `P = K - R * (R - 1) // 2`.
2. From position `P` at row `R`, we can move to the previous row `R-1` to either position `P-1` (left parent) or position `P` (right parent).
3. We choose the right parent if `P` is not the first position in the row; otherwise, we choose the left parent.
4. Repeat this process until we reach the top of the triangle.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to find the row given an index in the triangle
def find_row(index):
    row = 1
    while index > row:
        index -= row
        row += 1
    return row

# Function to find the end number of a path
def end_number_of_path(moves):
    index = 1  # The top of the triangle
    row = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        index += (row - 1) if move == 1 else row
    return index

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path for a given end number
def max_sum_path_to_end_number(k):
    row = find_row(k)
    pos = k - row * (row - 1) // 2  # Position in the row
    max_sum = k
    while row > 1:
        if pos == 1:  # If at the start of the row, only left parent exists
            pos = 1
        else:  # If not at the start of the row, prefer right parent
            pos -= 1
        row -= 1
        parent = row * (row - 1) // 2 + pos
        max_sum += parent
    return max_sum

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(f.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split()))
        result = end_number_of_path(moves)
    elif C == 2:
        K = int(f.readline().strip())
        result = max_sum_path_to_end_number(K)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result) + "\n")
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the maximum sum path to a given end number `K` and produce the expected output for both types of inputs.

The output is not matching the expected result because the `max_sum_path_to_end_number` function has incorrect logic for backtracking the path to get the maximum sum. The choice between the left or right parent doesn't depend on whether `P` is the first position in the row or not, but rather on the overall position of `K` in the triangle. Also, the triangle numbers increase from left to right, but the maximum sum path is not necessarily always choosing the right parent.

To rewrite the `max_sum_path_to_end_number` function correctly, we need to find a path from the top of the triangle to `K` such that the sum of the numbers is maximized. To do that, we should always prefer moving to the right (choosing 2) when traversing from the top, because moving to the right reaches larger numbers faster. But since we are given the end number `K`, we need to calculate the theoretical maximum row index `R` we would reach if we always moved to the right from the top, and then compare it with the actual row index of `K`. If `K`'s row index is less than `R`, it means we had to move left at some point.

Let's re-implement the solution taking into account the above considerations:

```python
# Function to find the row and position within row, given an index in the triangle
def find_row_and_position(index):
    row = 1
    while index > row:
        index -= row
        row += 1
    return row, index

# Function to find the end number of a path
def end_number_of_path(moves):
    index = 1  # The top of the triangle
    row = 1
    for move in moves:
        row += 1
        index += (row - 1) if move == 1 else row
    return index

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path for a given end number
def max_sum_path_to_end_number(k):
    actual_row, position = find_row_and_position(k)
    max_sum = 0
    row = 1
    index = 1
    steps_right = position - 1  # Number of steps to the right to reach k from the start of its row

    # Calculate the path to K, always preferring to go right except when required to reach K's position
    for _ in range(actual_row - 1):
        if steps_right > 0:
            index += row
            steps_right -= 1
        else:
            index += row - 1
        max_sum += index
        row += 1

    max_sum += k  # Include K itself in the sum
    return max_sum

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as f:
    C = int(f.readline().strip())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(f.readline().strip())
        moves = list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split()))
        result = end_number_of_path(moves)
    elif C == 2:
        K = int(f.readline().strip())
        result = max_sum_path_to_end_number(K)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result) + "\n")
```

This solution should correctly calculate the maximum sum path ending at `K` and provide the expected output for the example test case and other cases as well.

The error in the previous attempts was in misunderstanding the path that leads to the maximum sum ending at `K`. To maximize the sum of the path, at every row we should choose the number that is larger between the two possible parents. Since the numbers increase from left to right, if `K` is on the right side of its row, its parent from the row above will be the number directly above it, which is `K - row`. If `K` is on the left side of its row, we should choose the parent on the left side, which is `K - row - 1`.

Let's address this point and write an accurate solution:

```python
# Function to find the row given an index in the triangle
def find_row(index):
    row = 1
    while index > row:
        index -= row
        row += 1
    return row

# Function to calculate the maximum sum path for a given end number
def max_sum_path_to_end_number(k):
    row = find_row(k)
    max_sum = k
    while row > 1:
        if k - row * (row - 1) // 2 > (row - 1) // 2:  # Check if k is in the right half of the row
            k -= row  # Right parent
        else:
            k -= (row - 1)  # Left parent
        max_sum += k

# Read input, perform the task based on input C, and write output
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin, open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    C = int(fin.readline())
    if C == 1:
        N = int(fin.readline())
        moves = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))
        # Starting at the top of the triangle
        number = 1
        for move in moves:
            row = find_row(number)
            if move == 1:
                number += row
            else:
                number += row + 1
        fout.write(f"{number}\n")
    elif C == 2:
        K = int(fin.readline())
        max_sum = max_sum_path_to_end_number(K)
        fout.write(f"{max_sum}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the maximum sum path ending at `K` by correctly determining the larger parent to add to the sum at each step. It should produce the expected output of `19` for the input of `2` followed by `9`.
