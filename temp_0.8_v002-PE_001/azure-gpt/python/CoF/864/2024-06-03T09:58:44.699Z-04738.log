Un indicator numeric este un dispozitiv de afişaj electronic destinat afişării unei **cifre** zecimale. Acesta conține 7 segmente notate cu `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, ca în figura alăturată.

Afişarea unei cifre se face prin aprinderea unei combinații de segmente:
~[0.png|width=10em|align=right]
- Cifra 0: `a`, `b`, `c` ,`d`,`e`,`f`
- Cifra 1: `b`, `c`
- Cifra 2: `a`, `b`, `d` ,`e`, `g`
- Cifra 3: `a`, `b`, `c` ,`d`, `g`
- Cifra 4: `b`, `c`, `f` ,`g`
- Cifra 5: `a`, `c`, `d` ,`f`, `g`
- Cifra 6: `a`, `c`, `d` ,`e`, `f`, `g`
- Cifra 7: `a`, `b`, `c`
- Cifra 8: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`
- Cifra 9: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `f`, `g`

# Cerință
Cunoscând un număr natural $N$ afișat cu ajutorul mai multor indicatoare numerice, să se scrie un program care determină:
1. Numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.
2. Numărul de numere distincte mai **mari** decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în **plus** față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice și fără a stinge niciun segment dintre cele deja aprinse.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare este `cifre.in`.

Pe prima linie a fişierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $V$ a cărui valoare poate fi doar $1$ sau $2$.

Pe a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se găsește numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire este `cifre.out`.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $1$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de segmente aprinse pentru afișarea numărului $N$.

Dacă valoarea lui $V$ este $2$ atunci fişierul de ieşire va conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural reprezentând numărul de numere distincte mai mari decât $N$, ce se pot forma prin aprinderea a cel puțin unui segment în plus, față de cele utilizate pentru afișarea numărului $N$, fără a folosi alte indicatoare numerice.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq N \leq 10^{19}$
- $20\%$ din teste vor avea $V = 1$, iar $80\%$ din teste vor avea $V = 2$.

The error you encountered, "docker: Error response from daemon: cannot start a stopped process: unknown," is not related to the Python code itself. It seems like an issue with the Docker daemon or the environment in which the code is being executed. 

The program provided above doesn't use Docker explicitly; it's a simple Python script. It's possible that the Docker issue was caused by the environment outside of the Python script. However, assuming the Python code is what we have to focus on, let's ensure that the solution meets the requirements of the challenge and is memory-efficient.

Here is the revised Python solution taking into account memory efficiency:

```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the segments for each digit.
SEGMENTS = {
    '0': np.array([1,1,1,1,1,1,0]),
    '1': np.array([0,1,1,0,0,0,0]),
    '2': np.array([1,1,0,1,1,0,1]),
    '3': np.array([1,1,1,1,0,0,1]),
    '4': np.array([0,1,1,0,0,1,1]),
    '5': np.array([1,0,1,1,0,1,1]),
    '6': np.array([1,0,1,1,1,1,1]),
    '7': np.array([1,1,1,0,0,0,0]),
    '8': np.array([1,1,1,1,1,1,1]),
    '9': np.array([1,1,1,1,0,1,1])
}

# Function to count the number of segments lit for a number.
def count_segments(number):
    return int(sum(np.sum(SEGMENTS[digit]) for digit in str(number)))

# Function to find the number of distinct greater numbers.
def count_greater_numbers(number):
    all_segments = np.array([1,1,1,1,1,1,1])
    number_str = str(number)
    possibilities = 0

    for index, digit in enumerate(number_str):
        current_segments = SEGMENTS[digit]
        remaining_digits = len(number_str) - index - 1
        for i, seg in enumerate(all_segments):
            if current_segments[i] == 0:
                # Calculate the number of variations for the remaining positions.
                variations = 7**remaining_digits
                possibilities += variations

    # Subtracting the count of the number itself.
    return possibilities - 1

# Read the input file.
with open('cifre.in', 'r') as file:
    V = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Write the output file.
with open('cifre.out', 'w') as file:
    if V == 1:
        file.write(f"{count_segments(N)}\n")
    elif V == 2:
        file.write(f"{count_greater_numbers(N)}\n")
```
```

This solution uses NumPy arrays for storing segment information which should be more memory-efficient than using sets. Additionally, the counting functions have been updated to work with these NumPy arrays. The file handling remains unchanged as it was already following the restrictions of the challenge.

Here is an updated version of the Python solution that adheres to the constraints of reading from 'cifre.in' and writing to 'cifre.out', without using 'input()' or 'print()' for I/O operations:

```markdown
```python
# Read the input file.
with open('cifre.in', 'r') as file:
    V = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = file.readline().strip()

# Define the number of segments lit for each digit.
SEGMENT_COUNT = {
    '0': 6,
    '1': 2,
    '2': 5,
    '3': 5,
    '4': 4,
    '5': 5,
    '6': 6,
    '7': 3,
    '8': 7,
    '9': 6
}

# Define the additional segments that can be lit to form a larger number for each digit.
ADDITIONAL_SEGMENTS = {
    '0': {'8'},
    '1': {'3', '4', '7', '8', '9'},
    '2': {'8'},
    '3': {'8', '9'},
    '4': {'8', '9'},
    '5': {'6', '8', '9'},
    '6': {'8'},
    '7': {'0', '3', '8', '9'},
    '8': set(),
    '9': {'8'}
}

# Function to count the number of segments lit for a number.
def count_segments(number):
    return sum(SEGMENT_COUNT[digit] for digit in number)

# Function to find the number of distinct greater numbers.
def count_greater_numbers(number):
    possibilities = 0
    for index, digit in enumerate(number):
        greater_digits = ADDITIONAL_SEGMENTS[digit]
        possibilities += sum(2**(len(number) - index - 1) for _ in greater_digits)
    return possibilities

# If V is 1, count the number of segments lit for the number N.
# If V is 2, count the number of greater numbers that can be formed.
result = count_segments(N) if V == 1 else count_greater_numbers(N)

# Write the output to the file.
with open('cifre.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{result}\n")
```
```

This solution does not use numpy or other libraries, as it's not necessary for the given problem and keeping the solution minimal helps in staying within the memory limit. The functions `count_segments` and `count_greater_numbers` have been adjusted to work with the new data structures defined. 

The `ADDITIONAL_SEGMENTS` is a dictionary that maps each digit to the set of digits that can be formed by adding more segments to the current digit. This is used to calculate the number of larger numbers that can be made from the current number.

The solution reads the values of `V` and `N` from 'cifre.in', performs the required calculation based on the value of `V`, and writes the result to 'cifre.out'.

```

This code defines two functions `count_segments` and `count_greater_numbers`, which correspond to the two parts of the problem statement: (1) counting the number of segments lit for displaying the number N and (2) counting the number of distinct greater numbers that can be formed by lighting at least one more segment.

The input is read from a file named 'cifre.in', and the output is written to a file named 'cifre.out'. This is done using file handling in Python, without using `input()` or `print()`, as per the challenge requirements.

Below is the Python solution for the programming challenge without using `numpy` or any other library that could potentially exceed the memory limit. This solution reads from `cifre.in` and writes to `cifre.out` as required:

```markdown
```python
# Constants for segment counts for each digit
SEGMENT_COUNTS = [6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]

# Map from each digit to a list of digits that can be formed by adding segments
MORE_SEGMENTS = {
    '0': ['8'],
    '1': ['7', '3', '4', '8', '9'],
    '2': ['8'],
    '3': ['8', '9'],
    '4': ['8', '9'],
    '5': ['6', '8', '9'],
    '6': ['8'],
    '7': ['8', '0', '3', '9'],
    '8': [],
    '9': ['8'],
}

# Function to count the number of segments lit for a number
def count_segments(number):
    return sum(SEGMENT_COUNTS[int(digit)] for digit in number)

# Function to count the number of greater numbers that can be formed
def count_greater_numbers(number):
    greater_count = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(number):
        for greater_digit in MORE_SEGMENTS[digit]:
            diff = int(greater_digit) - int(digit)
            # Multiplier for the position of the digit within the number
            multiplier = 10 ** (len(number) - i - 1)
            greater_count += diff * multiplier
    return greater_count

# Read from 'cifre.in'
with open('cifre.in', 'r') as infile:
    V = int(infile.readline().strip())
    N = infile.readline().strip()

# Determine the result based on the value of V
if V == 1:
    result = count_segments(N)
elif V == 2:
    result = count_greater_numbers(N)

# Write to 'cifre.out'
with open('cifre.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
```
```

This solution should be both time and memory efficient, as it uses simple data structures (lists and dictionaries) and basic arithmetic operations. The input and output file handling is done according to specifications without using `input()` or `print()`.

Here is the Python solution that reads from `cifre.in` and writes to `cifre.out` without using `input()` or `print()`. This solution is optimized for both time and memory efficiency, keeping in mind the memory limit of ~8MB.

    return sum(segment_count[digit] for digit in number)

# Function to count the number of greater numbers that can be formed
def count_greater_numbers(number):
    # For each digit in the number, count the possibilities by adding more segments

        '7': 3, # Can turn 7 into 0, 3, 8, 9
        '8': 0, # 8 cannot be turned into a higher number by adding segments
        '9': 1  # Can only turn 9 into 8
    }
    possibilities = 0
    # Reverse the number to make it easier to calculate possibilities
    reversed_number = number[::-1]
    for i in range(len(reversed_number)):
        digit = reversed_number[i]
        # For each position, calculate the number of possibilities
        # by adding the additional segments for the current digit
        # and considering the additional possibilities brought by the more significant digits
        possibilities += additional_segments[digit] * (10**i)
    return possibilities

# Read the input file
with open('cifre.in', 'r') as infile:
    V = int(next(infile).strip())
    N = next(infile).strip()

# Process and write the output file
with open('cifre.out', 'w') as outfile:

        outfile.write(f"{count_segments(N)}\n")
    elif V == 2:
        outfile.write(f"{count_greater_numbers(N)}\n")
```
```

This solution implements two functions: `count_segments` for counting the number of segments required to display the number `N` and `count_greater_numbers` for calculating the number of distinct numbers greater than `N` that can be formed by turning on more segments. The digit-to-segment mapping is done efficiently using dictionaries.

The data from 'cifre.in' is read without using the `input()` function, and the result is written to 'cifre.out' without using the `print()` function, as per the challenge's constraints.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is the correct Python solution that adheres to the constraints, using file operations to read from `cifre.in` and write to `cifre.out`:

```markdown
```python
# Define the segments for each digit.
SEGMENTS_COUNT = {
    '0': 6, '1': 2, '2': 5, '3': 5, '4': 4,
    '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 3, '8': 7, '9': 6
}

TRANSITIONS = {
    '0': ['8'],
    '1': ['0', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9'],
    '2': ['8'],
    '3': ['8', '9'],
    '4': ['8', '9'],
    '5': ['6', '8', '9'],
    '6': ['8'],
    '7': ['0', '3', '8', '9'],
    '8': [],
    '9': ['8']
}

# Function to count the number of segments lit for a number.
def count_segments(number):
    return sum(SEGMENTS_COUNT[digit] for digit in number)

# Function to calculate the number of possible transitions.
def count_transitions(digit):
    return sum(1 for next_digit in TRANSITIONS[digit] if next_digit > digit)

# Function to find the number of distinct greater numbers.
def count_greater_numbers(number):
    greater_numbers = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(number)):
        greater_numbers += count_transitions(digit) * 10**i
    return greater_numbers

# Read the input file.
with open('cifre.in', 'r') as file:
    V = int(file.readline().strip())
    N = file.readline().strip()

# Perform the calculation based on the value of V.
result = count_segments(N) if V == 1 else count_greater_numbers(N)

# Write the output file.
with open('cifre.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{result}\n")
```
```

This program includes two functions:
- `count_segments` to count the total number of lit segments required to display the number `N`.
- `count_greater_numbers` to count the number of possible distinct greater numbers that can be formed by lighting up additional segments.

The program reads from `cifre.in` and writes the result to `cifre.out` according to the challenge's requirements.
