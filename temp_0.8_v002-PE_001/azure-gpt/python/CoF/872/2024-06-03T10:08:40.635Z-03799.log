În anul $2214$ a izbucnit primul război interstelar. Pământul a fost atacat de către $n$ civilizații extraterestre, pe care le vom numerota pentru simplicitate de la $1$ la $n$.

Pentru a se apăra, pământenii au inventat o armă specială ce poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, fabricate dintr-un material special denumit narun. Dacă arma este programată la nivelul $p$, atunci un proiectil de greutate $k$ va ajunge exact la distanța $k^p$ km ($k$ la puterea $p$) față de Pământ și dacă în acel punct se află cartierul general al unui atacator, acesta va fi distrus. De exemplu, dacă arma este programată la nivelul $2$, un proiectil de greutate 10 va distruge cartierul general al extratereștrilor situat la distanța $10^2 = 100$ km de Pământ.
Arma poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, dar cum narunul este un material foarte rar și foarte scump, pământenii vor să folosească proiectile cât mai ușoare pentru a distruge cartierele generale inamice.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se $n$, numărul atacatorilor, precum și cele $n$ distanțe până la cartierele generale ale acestora, să se scrie un program care determină:

1. Cantitatea minimă de narun necesară pentru a distruge toate cartierele generale inamice;
2. Nivelurile la care trebuie programată arma, pentru a distruge fiecare cartier general inamic cu o cantitate minimă de narun.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arma.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $c$ reprezentând cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Pe cea de a doua linie se află numărul natural $n$, reprezentând numărul atacatorilor. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se află $n$ numere naturale, câte un număr pe o linie; pe cea de a $i$-a linie dintre cele $n$ se află distanța față de Pământ a cartierului general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre

# Date de ieșire

Dacă cerința $c = 1$, atunci pe prima linie a fișierului `arma.out` va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cantitatea minimă de narun necesară distrugerii tuturor cartierelor generale inamice.

Dacă cerința este $c = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `arma.out` va conține $n$ linii. Pe a $i$-a linie se va scrie nivelul la care trebuie programată arma pentru a distruge cartierul general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Distanțele până la cartierele generale inamice sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru $50$% dintre teste cerința este $1$.

My apologies for the oversight. It appears that the Python environment does not have the `numpy` library installed. Since the environment constraints require us to optimize for memory and we can't use `numpy`, we will have to use standard Python libraries and functions to solve the problem. I'll rewrite the solution without using `numpy`.

```python
import math

# Function to determine the minimal projectile weight required to destroy a target.
def minimal_projectile_weight(distance):
    for p in range(1, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
        weight = round(distance ** (1/p))
        if weight ** p == distance:
            return weight
    return distance

# Function to determine the power level required to destroy a target.
def power_level(distance):
    for p in range(1, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
        weight = round(distance ** (1/p))
        if weight ** p == distance:
            return p
    return 1

# Read input data
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Write output data
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        # Write the minimum amount of narun required to destroy all enemy headquarters.
        min_narun = sum(minimal_projectile_weight(distance) for distance in distances)
        file.write(f"{min_narun}\n")
    elif c == 2:
        # Write the levels at which the weapon must be programmed to destroy each enemy headquarters.
        for distance in distances:
            programming_level = power_level(distance)
            file.write(f"{programming_level}\n")
```

This solution utilises the Python standard library and math operations to calculate both the minimal projectile weights and the power levels without exceeding the memory limit of ~8MB. The code now avoids using `numpy` and should run in an environment where it's not installed.

Upon examining the discrepancy between the expected and found results, it's clear that the current implementation of `minimal_projectile_weight` incorrectly determines the minimal weight of the projectile. The problem lies in the way the function checks if a given weight to a given power exactly equals the distance. The function uses a rounding method that does not guarantee finding the smallest weight that, when raised to some power, equals the distance.

To correct this, we need to find the integer `k` such that `k^p = d` for each distance `d`, where `k` and `p` are integers and `p` is as small as possible. This is equivalent to finding the prime factorization of `d` and using the maximum multiplicity of any prime factor in the factorization as `p`, which will give us the minimal `k`. However, the prime factorization approach may not be memory efficient, so instead, we'll use an algorithm to find the exact integer root, if it exists, for each exponent `p` that could potentially be the power level.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
import math

# Function to find the smallest integer root of a number
def integer_root(k, n):
    # Binary search to find the integer root
    low = 1
    high = n
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        mid_pow = mid ** k
        if mid_pow < n:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low if low ** k == n else None

# Function to determine the minimal projectile weight required to destroy a target.
def minimal_projectile_weight(distance):
    for p in range(1, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
        root = integer_root(p, distance)
        if root is not None:
            return root
    return distance

# Read input data
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Write output data
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        # Write the minimum amount of narun required to destroy all enemy headquarters.
        # Since we're only interested in the minimum narun, which corresponds to the projectile weights,
        # we only need to sum the projectile weights for each distance.
        min_narun = sum(minimal_projectile_weight(distance) for distance in distances)
        file.write(f"{min_narun}\n")
```

This revised solution will correctly identify the smallest integer root for each distance when raised to some power equals the distance, and add up those roots to find the minimum amount of narun required. It should match the expected result.

The results differ because my previous implementation did not find the exponents correctly. Instead of finding the smallest projectile weights that exactly match the distances when raised to some power, the implementation was incorrectly summing up minimal roots that do not correspond to the actual problem requirements.

The key to solving this problem is to find the smallest integer `k` and the corresponding exponent `p` for each distance such that `k ^ p = distance`. To do that efficiently, we need to find the largest integer `p` such that `k` is still an integer. This is equivalent to finding the integer `k` that when raised to the smallest `p` gives us the distance. We can achieve this by trying to take the p-th root of the distance and checking if it's an integer.

Let's attempt to solve the task using a different approach that doesn't require a binary search for integer roots:

```python
# Function to determine the minimal projectile weight and its power to destroy a target.
def minimal_projectile_weight_and_power(distance):
    for p in range(int(math.log(distance, 2)), 0, -1):  # Start from the largest possible power
        root = round(distance ** (1.0 / p))
        if root ** p == distance:  # Check if root is the correct integer root
            return root, p
    return distance, 1  # If no root found, return the distance itself with power 1

# Read input data
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Process the data and Write output data
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        min_narun = 0
        for distance in distances:
            weight, power = minimal_projectile_weight_and_power(distance)
            min_narun += weight  # Sum the minimal projectile weights
        file.write(f"{min_narun}\n")
```

This solution iterates through potential powers starting from the highest possible (`log2(distance)`) and checks for an integer root. When the correct power and weight are found, they are used to update the minimum narun required. This should give the correct result.

The error indicates that the `math` module is not defined. This is because I forgot to import the `math` module, which is necessary to use the logarithm function. Let's fix the code by importing the `math` module and then proceed with the solution.

```python
import math

# Function to determine the minimal projectile weight and its power to destroy a target.
def minimal_projectile_weight_and_power(distance):
    for p in range(int(math.log(distance, 2)), 0, -1):  # Start from the largest possible power
        root = round(distance ** (1.0 / p))
        if root ** p == distance:  # Check if root is the correct integer root
            return root
    return distance  # If no root found, return the distance itself

# Read input data
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Process the data and Write output data
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        min_narun = 0
        for distance in distances:

            min_narun += weight  # Sum the minimal projectile weights
        file.write(f"{min_narun}\n")
```

This should now correctly import the `math` module and use the logarithm function to calculate the powers, and correctly sum the minimal projectile weights for each distance to get the total minimum amount of narun required.

It seems that in the previous response, I addressed only part of the problem for case 1, where we are calculating the minimum amount of narun. However, for case 2, the program should calculate the power levels at which the weapon must be programmed to destroy each enemy headquarters. The function `minimal_projectile_weight_and_power` actually should return both weight and power, and my last submission had an error where it only returned the weight.

Let's correct the implementation to account for both case 1 and case 2 in the problem statement:

```python
import math

# Function to determine the minimal projectile weight and the corresponding power level
def minimal_projectile_weight_and_power(distance):
    min_weight = distance
    min_power = 1
    for p in range(1, int(math.log2(distance)) + 2):
        root = round(distance ** (1.0/p))
        if root ** p == distance:
            min_weight = root
            min_power = p
            break  # once the minimal weight is found, we break the loop
    return min_weight, min_power

# Read input data
with open('arma.in', 'r') as file:
    c = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Process the data and write output data
with open('arma.out', 'w') as file:
    if c == 1:
        # Case 1: Write the minimum amount of narun required to destroy all enemy headquarters
        min_narun = sum(minimal_projectile_weight_and_power(distance)[0] for distance in distances)
        file.write(f"{min_narun}\n")
    elif c == 2:
        # Case 2: Write the power levels for each headquarters
        for distance in distances:
            _, power = minimal_projectile_weight_and_power(distance)
            file.write(f"{power}\n")
```

This solution should correctly identify the smallest projectile weight and the corresponding power level required to destroy each target and should match the expected output for both cases.
