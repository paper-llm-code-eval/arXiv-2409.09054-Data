În anul $2214$ a izbucnit primul război interstelar. Pământul a fost atacat de către $n$ civilizații extraterestre, pe care le vom numerota pentru simplicitate de la $1$ la $n$.

Pentru a se apăra, pământenii au inventat o armă specială ce poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, fabricate dintr-un material special denumit narun. Dacă arma este programată la nivelul $p$, atunci un proiectil de greutate $k$ va ajunge exact la distanța $k^p$ km ($k$ la puterea $p$) față de Pământ și dacă în acel punct se află cartierul general al unui atacator, acesta va fi distrus. De exemplu, dacă arma este programată la nivelul $2$, un proiectil de greutate 10 va distruge cartierul general al extratereștrilor situat la distanța $10^2 = 100$ km de Pământ.
Arma poate fi încărcată cu proiectile de diferite greutăți, dar cum narunul este un material foarte rar și foarte scump, pământenii vor să folosească proiectile cât mai ușoare pentru a distruge cartierele generale inamice.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se $n$, numărul atacatorilor, precum și cele $n$ distanțe până la cartierele generale ale acestora, să se scrie un program care determină:

1. Cantitatea minimă de narun necesară pentru a distruge toate cartierele generale inamice;
2. Nivelurile la care trebuie programată arma, pentru a distruge fiecare cartier general inamic cu o cantitate minimă de narun.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `arma.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $c$ reprezentând cerința care trebuie să fie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Pe cea de a doua linie se află numărul natural $n$, reprezentând numărul atacatorilor. Pe următoarele $n$ linii se află $n$ numere naturale, câte un număr pe o linie; pe cea de a $i$-a linie dintre cele $n$ se află distanța față de Pământ a cartierului general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre

# Date de ieșire

Dacă cerința $c = 1$, atunci pe prima linie a fișierului `arma.out` va fi scris un număr natural reprezentând cantitatea minimă de narun necesară distrugerii tuturor cartierelor generale inamice.

Dacă cerința este $c = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `arma.out` va conține $n$ linii. Pe a $i$-a linie se va scrie nivelul la care trebuie programată arma pentru a distruge cartierul general al celei de a $i$-a civilizații extraterestre.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10 \ 000$;
* Distanțele până la cartierele generale inamice sunt numere naturale nenule $\leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;
* Pentru $50$% dintre teste cerința este $1$.

The program result does not match the expected result because the function `find_gcd` returns 1, which means it finds the greatest common divisor of all given distances to be 1, but this is not the correct approach for finding the minimum quantity of narun. Instead, we need to find the smallest projectile weight for each distance, which is the smallest integer `k` such that `k^p = d` for some integer `p`, where `d` is the distance.

To fix the program, we can implement a function that calculates the smallest integer `k` and its corresponding power `p` for each distance `d`. The sum of all smallest `k` values will be our answer for part 1 of the problem. For part 2, we only need to output the corresponding `p` for each `d`.

Let's fix the solution by changing the way we calculate the minimum narun and the power levels accordingly:

```python
# Function to find the smallest integer `k` and its corresponding power `p` such that `k^p = d`.
def smallest_projectile_and_power(d):
    for p in range(1, 32): # Since 2^31 is greater than the maximum distance, we can limit p to 31.
        k = int(round(d ** (1.0 / p)))
        if k ** p == d:
            return k, p
    return 1, d # If no exact power was found, we return 1 and the distance itself

# Read input from file
with open('arma.in', 'r') as f:
    c = int(f.readline().strip())
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(f.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

if c == 1:
    # Find the sum of the smallest projectiles for all distances.
    min_narun = sum(smallest_projectile_and_power(d)[0] for d in distances)
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(min_narun) + '\n')
elif c == 2:
    # Calculate the power level needed to destroy each enemy headquarters.
    with open('arma.out', 'w') as f:
        for distance in distances:
            _, power_level = smallest_projectile_and_power(distance)
            f.write(str(power_level) + '\n')

The provided solution is incorrect because it attempts to find the smallest projectile and power level individually for each distance. However, the correct approach to solving the problem is to find the smallest projectile weight that can be raised to an integer power to reach each distance exactly.

The expected output calculates the sum of projectile weights after finding the optimal integer power for each distance, ensuring the minimum amount of narun is used. The error in the result indicates that the current logic does not correctly find the optimal power and projectile weight for each distance.

Let's fix the solution by implementing the correct approach. The prime factors of each distance give us the potential projectile weights and the corresponding power levels. We need to find the highest power level for each prime factor across all distances. Then we can deduce the minimum projectile weight for each distance.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to factorize a number into its prime factors and their highest powers
def factorize(n):
    factors = {}
    # Count the number of 2s that divide n
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
        n = n // 2
    # n must be odd at this point, so a skip of 2 (i = i + 2) can be used
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        # while i divides n, append i and divide n
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            n = n // i
    # If n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1
    return factors

# Function to calculate the highest power of each prime factor across all distances
def highest_powers(factors_list):
    highest = {}
    for factors in factors_list:
        for factor, power in factors.items():
            if factor not in highest or highest[factor] < power:
                highest[factor] = power
    return highest

# Function to calculate the minimum narun required
def calc_min_narun(highest):
    result = 1
    for factor, power in highest.items():
        result *= (factor ** power)
    return result

# Read input from file
with open('arma.in', 'r') as f:
    c = int(f.readline().strip())
    n = int(f.readline().strip())
    distances = [int(f.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

if c == 1:
    # Find the prime factors for each distance and calculate their highest powers
    factors_list = [factorize(distance) for distance in distances]
    highest = highest_powers(factors_list)
    min_narun = calc_min_narun(highest)
