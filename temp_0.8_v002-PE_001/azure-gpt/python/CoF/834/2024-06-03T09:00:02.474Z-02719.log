Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, afişaţi oricare dintre acestea.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a lungimii secvenţei se acordă $10\%$ din punctajul pe test.

# markdown code block for python solution

import numpy as np

# Read the input from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file_in:
    signs = file_in.readline().strip()

# Initialize the result with the maximum number at the start
N = len(signs) + 1  # +1 since there is one more number than there are signs
result = np.arange(N, 0, -1)  # start with the reverse ordered sequence

# Find the sequences of '>' and reverse them in place
start = 0
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        if start < i:  # there is a sequence to reverse
            result[start:i+1] = result[start:i+1][::-1]
        start = i + 1  # update the start to the position after '<'

# Reverse the last sequence if needed
if signs[-1] == '>' and start < N - 1:
    result[start:N] = result[start:N][::-1]

# Now, result holds the initial sequence
# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{N}\n")
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```
```

This code reads the input from a file `compar.in`, processes the sequence signs, and writes the reconstructed sequence of numbers to `compar.out`. It uses numpy for efficient manipulation of the array and in-place reversing of sequences, which is memory-efficient and respects the 8 MB memory limit. The reverse ordering and in-place swapping ensure that the algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem.

It appears that the program exited with code 1 due to the fact that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since we cannot use `numpy` and we need to be mindful of memory usage, we will have to implement the solution without relying on any external libraries that are not part of the Python Standard Library.

Here's the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Read the input from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file_in:
    signs = file_in.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
result = list(range(N, 0, -1))

# Find the sequences of '>' and reverse them in place
start = 0
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        if start < i:
            result[start:i+1] = result[start:i+1][::-1]
        start = i + 1

# Reverse the last sequence if needed
if signs[-1] == '>' and start < N - 1:
    result[start:N] = result[start:N][::-1]

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{N}\n")
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

In this updated solution, I removed the dependency on `numpy` and used the built-in Python list to handle the sequence. The logic to reverse sequences of numbers corresponding to '>' signs remains unchanged. This approach should meet the memory requirements as well, as it uses in-place list operations which are memory-efficient.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is because my previous solution incorrectly reversed only the decreasing sequences (denoted by '>'), while it should also place the smallest numbers not yet used at the positions of '<'. The correct approach is to use a stack-like method where we place the largest possible number at the start of each '>' sequence and the smallest possible number at each '<'.

Let's reimplement the solution using this correct approach:

```python
# Read the input from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file_in:
    signs = file_in.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N

# Setup variables to determine the smallest and largest numbers available
next_smallest = 1
next_largest = N

# We use a stack to keep track of the positions where we need to fill the numbers
stack = []

for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        # When we encounter '<', we assign the next smallest number available
        result[i] = next_smallest
        next_smallest += 1
        # We also need to process the stack, as we have reached the end of a '>' sequence
        while stack:
            index = stack.pop()
            result[index] = next_smallest
            next_smallest += 1
    else:  # sign == '>'
        # Just push the index onto the stack and wait to assign the numbers later
        stack.append(i)

# Assign the remaining numbers (for the last part of the sequence)
result[-1] = next_smallest  # The last number should be the smallest available
while stack:  # Process any remaining '>' sequence
    index = stack.pop()
    next_smallest += 1
    result[index] = next_smallest

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{N}\n")
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution ensures that for every '<' sign, the next smallest number is used, and for sequences of '>' signs, the numbers are filled in after the sequence is ended by a '<' sign or the end of the list. The output will match the expected result, considering the signs and the constraints of the problem.

The last solution did not produce the correct output because it incorrectly filled in the numbers for the '>' sequences. Instead of using the next smallest number at the end of the '>' sequence, it should place the largest possible number at the start of the sequence and then go backwards.

To fix the solution, we need to account for the fact that when we encounter a '<' sign, we need to assign the smallest available number, and when we encounter a '>' sign, we need to delay the assignment until we know how long the '>' sequence is.

Let's rewrite the solution with these adjustments:

```python
# Read the input from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file_in:
    signs = file_in.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N

# Setup variables to determine the smallest and largest numbers available
next_smallest = 1
next_largest = N

# We use a stack to keep track of the '>' runs
stack = []

for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        # When we encounter '<', we need to flush the stack with the largest numbers first
        while stack:
            index = stack.pop()
            result[index] = next_largest
            next_largest -= 1
        # Assign the smallest available number for the current position
        result[i] = next_smallest
        next_smallest += 1
    else:  # sign == '>'
        # Push the index onto the stack to be processed when the '>' run ends
        stack.append(i)

# Assign the largest remaining numbers to the remaining indices in the stack
while stack:
    index = stack.pop()
    result[index] = next_largest
    next_largest -= 1

# The last number should be the largest available, as there are no '<' after it
result[-1] = next_largest

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{N}\n")
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This fix correctly handles runs of '>' by storing their starting positions and assigning values in reverse order once the run is terminated by a '<' or the end of the string. It should now produce the expected output for the given input.

The found output is still incorrect because the logic for filling the numbers after a '>' run is flawed. When we encounter a '<', we need to place the current smallest number, and for each '>', we should assign the numbers in descending order starting from the largest number immediately before a '<' or at the end of the sequence.

To correct this, we should not assign a number immediately when we see a '<'; instead, we should wait until we find the end of the '>' run. We keep track of the starting index of a '>' run, and when we reach a '<' or the end of the string, we fill it with the appropriate numbers in descending order.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file_in:
    signs = file_in.readline().strip()

N = len(signs) + 1
result = [0] * N

# Setup variables to determine the smallest and largest numbers available
next_smallest = 1
next_largest = N

# This variable will keep track of the start of a '>' sequence
start_greater_seq = None

for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        if start_greater_seq is not None:
            # If we are at the end of a '>' sequence, assign numbers in descending order
            for j in range(start_greater_seq, i + 1):
                result[j] = next_largest
                next_largest -= 1
            start_greater_seq = None
        else:
            # If there was no '>' sequence, assign the next smallest number
            result[i] = next_smallest
            next_smallest += 1
    else:  # sign == '>'
        if start_greater_seq is None:
            # We have hit the start of a '>' sequence
            start_greater_seq = i

# Assign numbers for the last sequence if it ends with '>'
if start_greater_seq is not None:
    for j in range(start_greater_seq, N):
        result[j] = next_largest
        next_largest -= 1

# If the sequence ends with '<', assign the next smallest number
if signs[-1] == '<':
    result[N - 1] = next_smallest

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{N}\n")
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly handle sequences of '>' by recording the start of such a sequence and assigning the numbers in descending order once a '<' is encountered or we reach the end of the sequence. For each '<', we assign the next smallest number. The end of the sequence is also handled correctly, ensuring either the next smallest or the next largest number is used depending on the last sign. This should now match the expected output.

The previous solution is still not handling the '>' sequences correctly. The idea is that when we encounter a sequence of '>' characters, the next character must be smaller than the previous ones, so we can fill this sequence with the largest numbers available in descending order, and the next smallest number right after the sequence ends. 

Let's fix the solution with this in mind:

```python
# Read the input from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file_in:
    signs = file_in.readline().strip()

# Calculate the length of the sequence
N = len(signs) + 1
# Initialize the result list
result = [None] * N

# Initialize the smallest and largest number to be placed next
next_smallest = 1
next_largest = N

# We go through the signs and decide where to place the largest numbers
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        # If the sign is '<', we place the next smallest number
        result[i] = next_smallest
        next_smallest += 1
    else:
        # If the sign is '>', we place the next largest number
        # But first, we need to ensure we place numbers for any previous '<' signs
        if result[i] is None:
            result[i] = next_smallest
            next_smallest += 1
        # We also need to keep track of the current position as the start of a '>' sequence
        start_greater_seq = i

        # We fill the '>' sequence with the largest numbers until we hit a '<' sign or end of the signs
        while i + 1 < N and signs[i] == '>':
            i += 1
            result[i] = next_largest
            next_largest -= 1

# The last number in the sequence should be the last smallest number if it hasn't been assigned yet
if result[-1] is None:
    result[-1] = next_smallest

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(f"{N}\n")
    file_out.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
```

This solution iterates through the signs, placing the smallest available numbers at the '<' signs and the largest numbers in decreasing order at the end of '>' sequences. By processing '>' sequences as soon as we encounter a '<' sign or reach the end of the signs, we make sure to place numbers in the correct order. This approach should now produce the expected output.
