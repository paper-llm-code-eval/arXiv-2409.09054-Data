Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, afişaţi oricare dintre acestea.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a lungimii secvenţei se acordă $10\%$ din punctajul pe test.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Markdown block to hold python solution code

import numpy as np

# Function to reconstitute the sequence based on signs
def reconstitute_sequence(signs):
    n = len(signs) + 1
    result = np.empty(n, dtype=int)
    # Initialize with the smallest and largest possible values
    low, high = 1, n
    
    # Create a stack to manage '<' runs
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n-1):
        if signs[i] == '<':
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            # When we encounter '>', we resolve all '<'s in the stack
            stack.append(i)
            while stack:
                result[stack.pop()] = low
                low += 1
    
    # Resolve any remaining '<' in the stack
    stack.append(n - 1)
    while stack:
        result[stack.pop()] = low
        low += 1

    # Return the reconstituted sequence
    return result

# Read from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Get the reconstituted sequence
reconstituted_sequence = reconstitute_sequence(signs)

# Write to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(reconstituted_sequence)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, reconstituted_sequence)) + "\n")
```
This code reads from `compar.in`, processes the data by reconstituting the sequence, and writes the output to `compar.out`. It optimizes for both time and memory by using in-place operations and numpy for efficient array handling.

The program exited with code 1 due to a `ModuleNotFoundError`, which indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment. Since the memory limit is ~8MB and using `numpy` could potentially exceed this limit, we can avoid using `numpy` and instead use Python's built-in data structures to optimize for memory usage.

Let's rewrite the solution to not use `numpy` and to make sure the memory usage is within the required limits.

```python
# Markdown block to hold the revised Python solution code

# Function to reconstitute the sequence based on signs
def reconstitute_sequence(signs):
    n = len(signs) + 1
    result = [0] * n  # A list to hold the reconstituted sequence
    low, high = 1, n  # Initialize with the smallest and largest possible values

    # Stack to manage '<' runs
    stack = []

    for i in range(n - 1):
        if signs[i] == '<':
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            # Resolve all '<'s in the stack when encountering '>'
            stack.append(i)
            while stack:
                result[stack.pop()] = low
                low += 1

    # Resolve any remaining '<' in the stack
    stack.append(n - 1)
    while stack:
        result[stack.pop()] = low
        low += 1

    return result

# Read from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Get the reconstituted sequence
reconstituted_sequence = reconstitute_sequence(signs)

# Write to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(reconstituted_sequence)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, reconstituted_sequence)) + "\n")
```

This revised solution removes the dependency on `numpy` and should comply with the memory limitations. It uses a list to store the sequence and a stack to keep track of the '<' characters, which allows for efficient in-place updates.

Based on the expected output and the current output, it seems that there is an issue with how the '<' and '>' signs are being translated into the number sequence. The algorithm must ensure that when there is a '<', the sequence increases, and when there is a '>', the sequence decreases. The expected output indicates that after a '>', there should be a decreasing sequence that corresponds to the length of the '>' run plus one.

The current algorithm correctly identifies runs of '<' signs and assigns the smallest available numbers to them. However, for runs of '>' signs, it does not assign the largest available numbers in descending order. We need to fix this part by reversing the order in which we assign numbers after a '>' sign, which will require a different approach to handle '>' runs.

Here's a rewritten solution with the necessary fix:

```python
# Markdown block to hold the revised Python solution code

# Function to reconstitute the sequence based on signs
def reconstitute_sequence(signs):
    n = len(signs) + 1
    result = [0] * n  # A list to hold the reconstituted sequence
    next_value = 1  # The next smallest value to assign

    # Iterate over the signs and construct the sequence
    i = 0
    while i < len(signs):
        if signs[i] == '<':
            # Assign the next smallest value and increment it
            result[i] = next_value
            next_value += 1
            i += 1
        else:
            # Calculate the length of the '>' run
            start = i
            while i < len(signs) and signs[i] == '>':
                i += 1
            end = i
            # Assign the largest values in descending order for this '>' run
            for j in range(end, start - 1, -1):
                result[j] = next_value
                next_value += 1

    # Assign the last value if it hasn't been assigned yet
    if result[-1] == 0:
        result[-1] = next_value

    return result

# Read from 'compar.in'
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Get the reconstituted sequence
reconstituted_sequence = reconstitute_sequence(signs)

# Write to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(reconstituted_sequence)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, reconstituted_sequence)) + "\n")
```

This solution should produce the expected output by correctly handling both '<' and '>' runs. It assigns the smallest available number for '<', and for '>' runs, it assigns the numbers in descending order starting from the last '>' in the run.
