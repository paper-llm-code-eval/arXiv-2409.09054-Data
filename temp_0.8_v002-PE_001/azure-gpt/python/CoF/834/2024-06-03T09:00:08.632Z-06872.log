Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 < N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Dacă există mai multe soluţii, afişaţi oricare dintre acestea.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a lungimii secvenţei se acordă $10\%$ din punctajul pe test.

Since the environment does not have numpy available and we have a strict memory limit, I will rewrite the solution using only built-in Python data structures which are more memory efficient. Here's the entire solution without numpy:

```python
# Open the input file and read the sequence of signs
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.readline().strip()

N = len(sequence) + 1  # Calculate N based on the sequence length
result = [0] * N  # Initialize the result list with zeros
stack = []

# Reconstruct the sequence using a stack
current = 1
for sign in sequence:
    if sign == '<':
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
    else:
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
        while stack:
            result[len(stack) - 1] = stack.pop()

# Place the last number
result[len(stack)] = current

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)) + "\n")
```

This version does not use numpy and should comply with the memory restrictions of the problem as well as run in environments where numpy is not installed.

The problem with the previous solution is that the index for placing the numbers in the `result` list is calculated incorrectly. We need to place the numbers at the indices where the '<' and '>' comparisons would have occurred in the original sequence, not based on the length of the stack. Additionally, the while loop is popping and assigning values immediately, which is not accounting for the current '>' comparison.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Open the input file and read the sequence of signs
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.readline().strip()

N = len(sequence) + 1  # Calculate N based on the sequence length
result = [0] * N  # Initialize the result list with zeros
stack = []

# Reconstruct the sequence using a stack
current = 1
for i, sign in enumerate(sequence):
    if sign == '<':
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
    else:
        # When we encounter '>', we should resolve the entire sequence of '<' that
        # might have come before it by popping from the stack and putting the numbers
        # in the right place.
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
        while stack:
            result[i - len(stack) + 2] = stack.pop()

# The last number (current) should be placed at the last position that has not been
# filled yet (which is either the first position or after the last '<' encountered).
result[result.index(0)] = current

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)) + "\n")
```

This code should now correctly reconstruct the original sequence based on the comparison signs and write the correct output to 'compar.out'.

The previous solution has a mistake in how it resolves the sequence after encountering the '>' sign, and it incorrectly assigns the last number. The correct approach after encountering the '>' sign is to resolve the stack until it is empty or until the next '<' sign is encountered, placing each popped number into the result list in its correct position.

Let's re-implement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Open the input file and read the sequence of signs
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.readline().strip()

N = len(sequence) + 1  # Calculate N based on the sequence length
result = [0] * N  # Initialize the result list with zeros
stack = []

# Reconstruct the sequence using a stack
current = 1
for i, sign in enumerate(sequence):
    if sign == '<':
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
    elif sign == '>':
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
        # Resolve the sequence of '<' by popping from the stack
        while stack:
            num = stack.pop()
            result[i + 1 - len(stack)] = num

# The last number should be placed after the last sequence of '<' which is at the end
# of the stack that has not been resolved yet.
stack.append(current)  # Append the last number to the stack
while stack:
    num = stack.pop()
    result[N - len(stack) - 1] = num

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)) + "\n")
```

This solution now correctly resolves the '<' sequences using a stack and assigns numbers to the correct positions in the result list. When the '>' sign is encountered, it processes the stack until it's empty or the next '<' sign is seen. Finally, it assigns the last number after the end of the last '<' sequence. This should yield the expected result.

I apologize for the previous oversight. The problem is caused by incorrectly placing the numbers in the sequence. In the '>' case, we should be resolving the numbers from the stack and placing them in the result array starting from the current index (`i + 1`) and moving backward as these numbers would be in descending order from that point. After processing the whole sequence, we should also resolve any remaining numbers in the stack in ascending order, which would occur at the beginning of the sequence. Let's fix the solution:

```python
# Open the input file and read the sequence of signs
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.readline().strip()

N = len(sequence) + 1  # Calculate N based on the sequence length
result = [0] * N  # Initialize the result list with zeros
stack = []

# Reconstruct the sequence using a stack
current = 1
for i, sign in enumerate(sequence):
    if sign == '<':
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
    elif sign == '>':
        stack.append(current)
        current += 1
        # When encountering '>', pop all elements from the stack, which will be in
        # descending order, and place them in the result list.
        while stack:
            result[i + 1 - len(stack)] = stack.pop()

# The last remaining number will be the current number, which needs to be placed
# either at the beginning or after the last '<' in the sequence.
stack.append(current)
while stack:
    result[len(stack) - 1] = stack.pop()

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)) + "\n")
```

This should work correctly as it now respects the descending order after a '>' and ensures that the numbers are placed appropriately. The remaining numbers in the stack after processing the sequence will fill in the ascending part at the beginning or after the last '<'.

The issue in the previous solutions is the incorrect handling of the '>' symbols and the incorrect placement of the numbers into the result list. We need to ensure that after we encounter a '>', we pop from the stack and fill the result list in reverse order, starting from the position where we encountered the '>'.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Open the input file and read the sequence of signs
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    sequence = file.readline().strip()

N = len(sequence) + 1  # Calculate N based on the sequence length
result = [0] * N  # Initialize the result list with zeros

# We will use a simple list as a stack.
stack = []

# We start from the end and assign the largest number, then decrease it
current = N

# We iterate through the sequence backwards (right-to-left)
for sign in reversed(sequence):
    if sign == '>':
        # When we see '>', we assign the current number to the result list
        # and decrement the current number.
        stack.append(current)
        current -= 1
    else:
        # When we see '<', we assign the current number and resolve the stack
        stack.append(current)
        current -= 1
        while stack:
            result[current + len(stack)] = stack.pop()

# Place the last number at the beginning
result[current] = stack.pop() if stack else current

# Write the output to 'compar.out'
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, result)) + "\n")
```

In this final solution, we traverse the sequence from right to left, pushing numbers onto the stack when we see '>', and popping numbers from the stack in reverse order when we see '<', which gives us the descending sequences. After processing the entire sequence, we ensure that any remaining number is placed correctly. This should produce the expected result.
