Ana şi Bogdan au inventat jocul "Compar". Ana scrie pe tablă o secvenţă formată din $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, apoi compară fiecare două numere învecinate din secvenţă scriind între ele semnul `<` sau semnul `>`, după caz.

De exemplu, dacă secvenţa de pe tablă este $6 \ 4 \ 2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 5$, după compararea elementelor învecinate şi inserarea semnelor în secvenţă, Ana obţine: $6>4>2>1<3<5$.
După aceea Ana şterge cele $N$ elemente ale secvenţei şi păstrează numai semnele, astfel: `>>><<`.
La final, Ana îi arată lui Bogdan şirul semnelor şi îi cere să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Cerință

Cunoscând şirul semnelor construit de Ana, scrieţi un program care să îl ajute pe Bogdan să reconstituie secvenţa de numere naturale distincte scrisă iniţial pe tablă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `compar.in` conţine pe prima linie o secvenţă de caractere din mulţimea $\{$`<`$,$ `>`$\}$, reprezentând şirul semnelor obţinut de Ana după compararea elementelor vecine din secvenţa iniţială.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `compar.out` va conţine pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, reprezentând lungimea secvenţei iniţiale. Pe a doua linie vor fi scrise $N$ numere naturale distincte cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând elementele secvenţei iniţiale, reconstituită pe baza semnelor din fişierul de intrare. 

# Restricții și precizări

Given the memory constraints and the error message indicating that NumPy is not available, I will rewrite the solution without relying on NumPy or any other external libraries.

Here's the updated solution:

```python
def reconstruct_sequence(signs):
    N = len(signs) + 1
    sequence = [0] * N
    decreasing_streak = []

    # Start with the largest number and work our way down
    num = N
    for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
        if sign == '<':
            # If we encounter a '<', we resolve the decreasing streak
            while decreasing_streak:
                sequence[decreasing_streak.pop()] = num
                num -= 1
            # The current position is the start of a new decreasing streak
            decreasing_streak.append(i)
        else:
            # If we encounter '>', we keep adding to the current decreasing streak
            decreasing_streak.append(i)

    # Resolve any remaining decreasing streak
    while decreasing_streak:
        sequence[decreasing_streak.pop()] = num
        num -= 1

    # Place the last number
    sequence[-1] = num

    return sequence

# Read from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Reconstruct the sequence
sequence = reconstruct_sequence(signs)

# Write to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{len(sequence)}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)))
```

This code reads the comparison signs from `compar.in`, reconstructs the sequence, and writes it to `compar.out`, all while adhering to the memory limitations and not using external libraries.

The primary issue with the previously provided solution is that the logic used to reconstruct the sequence is flawed. The sequence should start with the smallest number at the first `>` sign or the largest number at the first `<` sign we encounter and iterate from there, filling in the rest of the numbers as we go.

We need to process the signs in such a way that we correctly reconstruct the sequence of numbers. When we see a `<` sign, we know that we have to place a smaller number next, and when we see a `>` sign, we have to place a larger number next. Since we have a fixed set of numbers to use (from 1 to N) and we know that each number is unique and used exactly once, we can utilize a stack to keep track of the numbers to be placed when we encounter `<` signs.

Here is the corrected and more straightforward solution without using any external libraries:

```python
def reconstruct_sequence(signs):
    N = len(signs) + 1
    sequence = [0] * N
    stack = []
    current_min, current_max = 1, N

    for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
        if sign == '>':
            if not stack:  # If the stack is empty, start a new decreasing sequence
                sequence[i] = current_max
                current_max -= 1
            else:  # If the stack is not empty, pop from it to continue the sequence
                sequence[i] = stack.pop()
        else:  # If the sign is '<', push the next minimum onto the stack
            stack.append(current_min)
            current_min += 1

    # The last number is always the remaining minimum
    sequence[-1] = stack.pop() if stack else current_min

    return sequence

# Read from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Reconstruct the sequence
sequence = reconstruct_sequence(signs)

# Write to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{len(sequence)}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)))
```

This solution should now correctly interpret the signs, maintain the order, and produce the expected output. We use a stack to store the smallest available numbers when we encounter a `<` sign, and we immediately place the largest available number when we encounter a `>` sign. At the end of the sequence, we place the remaining number from the stack or the next smallest number.

The previously provided solution still contains a bug. The implementation of the algorithm used to determine the appropriate values to place in the sequence is incorrect, as indicated by the incorrect output.

We need to re-implement the solution with a correct algorithm. The key to this problem is understanding that when we encounter a `<` sign, it signifies the start of an ascending sequence, and when we encounter a `>` sign, it indicates the start of a descending sequence.

One way to solve this problem is to keep track of the descending sequences and resolve them when we encounter a `<` sign, which indicates that we are starting an ascending sequence. We can keep track of the lengths of the descending sequences and, when needed, fill them in with the largest numbers available, decreasing as we go.

The corrected solution is as follows:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
sequence = [0] * N
# We start with the largest number possible and count down
current_num = N
# We use a counter to keep track of how many descending numbers we need
desc_count = 0

for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '>':
        # Increase the count for consecutive '>'
        desc_count += 1
    else:
        # If it's '<', we resolve any previous descending counts
        if desc_count:
            sequence[i-desc_count:i+1] = range(current_num-desc_count, current_num+1)
            current_num -= desc_count
            desc_count = 0
        sequence[i] = current_num
        current_num -= 1
# After processing all signs, place remaining numbers
sequence[-desc_count-1:] = range(current_num-desc_count, current_num+1)

# Write to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)))
```

This adjusted solution should compute the output correctly by handling both ascending and descending sequences properly, ensuring that the numbers are placed in accordance with the input signs.

The previous solution has a logical error in handling the descending sequences. The length of the descending sequence is not being handled correctly when we encounter a '<' sign. The bug lies in the way we are filling the numbers in the descending sequence, which is affecting the overall sequence.

Let's try a different approach to solve the problem.

The correct algorithm needs to account for the following:
1. When we encounter a '<' sign, we are starting an ascending sequence, so the next number should be the smallest available.
2. When we encounter a '>' sign, we are starting a descending sequence, and we should wait until we encounter a '<' sign or reach the end of the signs string to determine how many numbers are in the descending sequence.

We can use two counters to keep track of the smallest and largest numbers that have not been used yet. We can also use a stack to keep track of the positions where we need to place numbers after finding the length of a descending sequence.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
sequence = [0] * N
# We start with the smallest number possible and count up
current_min = 1
# We start with the largest number possible and count down
current_max = N
# Stack to keep track of the positions that start a descending sequence
stack = []

# Iterate through the signs and build the sequence
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '<':
        # If sign is '<', we place the smallest available number and increment it
        sequence[i] = current_min
        current_min += 1
        # Resolve any descending sequences
        while stack:
            sequence[stack.pop()] = current_max
            current_max -= 1
    else:
        # If sign is '>', we push the position onto the stack
        stack.append(i)

# Place the final number for the last '<' or '>'
sequence[N - 1] = current_min
# Resolve any remaining descending sequences
while stack:
    sequence[stack.pop()] = current_max
    current_max -= 1

# Write to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sequence)))
```

This solution uses a stack to track where the descending sequences start. When we encounter a '<' sign, we assign the current smallest number to that position and resolve any previous '>' by assigning the largest available numbers in descending order. This ensures that ascending sequences are filled with the smallest available numbers and descending sequences with the largest, which correctly reconstructs the sequence based on the input signs.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. The expected output indicates that we should start with the highest number at the first '>' sign and assign the lowest possible numbers at each '<' sign encountered.

The correct approach is to use a stack to keep track of the indices where a descending sequence starts (each '>' sign). When we encounter '<' or the end of the signs, we pop from the stack and fill in the numbers in descending order. At each '<' sign, we place the lowest available number. This way, we can construct the sequence correctly.

Let's rewrite the solution with this approach:

```python
# Read from the input file
with open('compar.in', 'r') as file:
    signs = file.readline().strip()

# Initialize variables
N = len(signs) + 1
sequence = [0] * N
# Stack to keep track of the positions where a descending sequence starts
stack = []
current_min = 1
current_max = N

# Iterate through the signs
for i, sign in enumerate(signs):
    if sign == '>':
        # For '>', mark the position by pushing onto the stack
        stack.append(i)
    elif sign == '<':
        # For '<', assign the smallest number and increase it
        sequence[i] = current_min
        current_min += 1
        # Assign numbers in descending order from the stack
        while stack:
            sequence[stack.pop()] = current_max
            current_max -= 1

# Assign the remaining number to the last position
sequence[-1] = current_max
current_max -= 1

# If there are still items in stack, assign the numbers in descending order
while stack:
    sequence[stack.pop()] = current_max
    current_max -= 1

# Write to the output file
with open('compar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{N}\n')
    sequence_str = ' '.join(str(num) for num in sequence)
    file.write(sequence_str)
```

This solution should now handle the '<' and '>' signs correctly and produce the expected output. We fill in the numbers in descending order whenever we encounter '<' and assign the smallest numbers immediately at these positions. The end result should match the challenge's requirements.
