Într-o școală există un sistem de acces cu ajutorul cartelelor, conectat la un calculator și o imprimantă. Fiecare elev al școlii are câte o cartelă. Într-o zi, la utilizarea fiecărei cartele, sistemul imprimă următoarele informații pe hârtie, pe câte o linie, după regula următoare:

* Caracterul `b` dacă elevul este băiat sau caracterul `f` dacă este fată. Caracterul va fi urmat de un spațiu;
* Caracterul `i` dacă elevul a intrat în școală sau caracterul `e` dacă a ieșit din școală. De asemenea, acest caracter va fi urmat de un spațiu;
* Momentul utilizării cartelei, exprimat prin oră, minute și secunde. Acestea vor fi reprezentate în cadrul liniei, exact în această ordine, prin trei numere naturale, separate între ele prin câte un spațiu.

# Cerință

Cunoscându-se toate cele $N$ linii imprimate într-o zi determinați:

1. Câți băieți și câte fete sunt la școală după cele $N$ acțiuni imprimate de sistem.
2. Care este numărul total de secunde în care, în școală, s-au aflat un număr egal, nenul, de fete și băieți, până în momentul utilizării ultimei cartele. Dacă nu există această situație se afișează $0$.
3. Care este numărul maxim de secunde în care, în școală, până în momentul utilizării ultimei cartele, s-au aflat neîntrerupt un număr impar de băieți. Dacă nu există o astfel de situație se afișează $0$.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `cartele.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând numărul cerinţei care poate avea valorile $1$, $2$ sau $3$, pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe următoarele $N$ linii informațiile imprimate de sistem sub forma descrisă în enunț, în ordinea strict crescătoare a momentului folosirii cartelei.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $C = 1$, atunci fişierul de ieşire `cartele.out` va conține, în această ordine, separate printr-un spațiu, numărul de băieți și numărul de fete determinat conform cerinței $1$.
Dacă $C = 2$ sau $C = 3$, atunci fişierul de ieşire `cartele.out` va conţine pe prima linie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă rezultatul determinat conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 10 \ 000$;
* La momentul utilizării primei cartele, în școală nu se află niciun elev
* Sistemul de acces nu permite folosirea simultană a două cartele
* Pentru orice linie imprimată de sistem $0 \leq ora \leq 23$, $0 \leq minute \leq 59$; și $0 \leq secunde \leq 59$;
* Pe fiecare linie a fișierului de intrare, după ultimul număr, reprezentând secundele, nu există spațiu.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerințe se acordă $20$ de puncte, pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de-a doua cerințe se acordă $30$ de puncte iar pentru rezolvarea corectă a celei de-a treia cerințe se acordă $40$ de puncte. $10$ puncte sunt din oficiu.

The error message indicates that `numpy` is not available in the execution environment. Since the challenge specifies optimizing both time and memory, we should not use unnecessary libraries, especially if they are not essential to the solution. Given the memory limit, a lean solution without `numpy` is appropriate.

Here is the revised solution without `numpy`:

```python

    return boys, girls

    last_equal_time = 0
    for event in events:

        elif boys % 2 == 0 and last_odd_start != -1:

This solution reads from a file named `cartele.in` and writes to a file named `cartele.out`. It solves the three tasks as described in the problem statement, without using `numpy` or any other external libraries which may not be available in the execution environment. The solution keeps track of the number of boys and girls, the total time with an equal number of boys and girls, and the maximum time with an odd number of boys, which addresses the problem's requirements.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found result suggests there's an issue in the way the time during which an equal number of boys and girls are inside the school is calculated.

Upon closer examination, the code increments `equal_time` whenever the number of boys and girls is equal, without considering whether this balance has changed since the last event. The code needs to adjust the time intervals during which the number of boys and girls remains equal.

Let's fix the solution for task 2. The solution should keep track of the last timestamp when the number of boys and girls became equal and update the `equal_time` only when this balance is disrupted.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def get_seconds(hour, minute, second):
    return hour * 3600 + minute * 60 + second

def solve_task1(events):
    boys, girls = 0, 0
    for event in events:
        if event[0] == 'b':
            boys += 1 if event[1] == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if event[1] == 'i' else -1
    return boys, girls

def solve_task2(events):
    boys, girls, equal_time, prev_time, equal_start_time = 0, 0, 0, 0, None
    for event in events:
        hour, minute, second = map(int, event[2:])
        current_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        if boys == girls and boys > 0 and equal_start_time is None:
            equal_start_time = prev_time
        if boys != girls:
            if equal_start_time is not None:
                equal_time += current_time - equal_start_time
                equal_start_time = None
        if event[0] == 'b':
            boys += 1 if event[1] == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if event[1] == 'i' else -1
        prev_time = current_time
    if boys == girls and boys > 0 and equal_start_time is not None:
        equal_time += prev_time - equal_start_time
    return equal_time

def solve_task3(events):
    boys, max_odd_time, current_time, last_odd_start = 0, 0, 0, None
    for event in events:
        hour, minute, second = map(int, event[2:])
        new_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        if boys % 2 == 1 and last_odd_start is None:
            last_odd_start = current_time
        elif boys % 2 == 0 and last_odd_start is not None:
            max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - last_odd_start)
            last_odd_start = None
        boys += 1 if event[0] == 'b' and event[1] == 'i' else -1 if event[0] == 'b' else 0
        current_time = new_time
    if boys % 2 == 1 and last_odd_start is not None:
        max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - last_odd_start)
    return max_odd_time

def main():
    with open('cartele.in', 'r') as file:
        task_number = int(file.readline().strip())
        n_events = int(file.readline().strip())
        events = [line.strip().split() for line in file.readlines()]

    if task_number == 1:
        result = solve_task1(events)
    elif task_number == 2:
        result = solve_task2(events)
    elif task_number == 3:
        result = solve_task3(events)

    with open('cartele.out', 'w') as file:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            file.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{result}\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This revised solution fixes the issue with task 2. It now only updates `equal_time` when the number of boys and girls becomes unequal, and adds the time elapsed since they were last equal. Additionally, it makes sure to account for the time interval at the end of the day if the number of boys and girls is still equal.

The issue in the current solution for task 2 is that it only adds time when the balance between boys and girls is disrupted, which is incorrect because it should accumulate time as long as the number of boys and girls is equal and non-zero.

To fix this, I'll modify the logic to start timing when the number of boys and girls becomes equal and to stop and add to the total when this balance is disrupted.

Let's correct the code for task 2:

```python
def get_seconds(hour, minute, second):
    return hour * 3600 + minute * 60 + second

def update_equal_time(boys, girls, current_time, last_event_time, equal_start_time):
    if boys == girls and boys != 0:
        if equal_start_time is None:
            equal_start_time = last_event_time
    else:
        if equal_start_time is not None:
            return current_time - equal_start_time, None
    return 0, equal_start_time

def solve_task1(events):
    boys, girls = 0, 0
    for event in events:
        if event[0] == 'b':
            boys += 1 if event[1] == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if event[1] == 'i' else -1
    return boys, girls

def solve_task2(events):
    boys, girls, equal_time, last_event_time, equal_start_time = 0, 0, 0, 0, None
    for event in events:
        hour, minute, second = map(int, event[2:])
        current_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        time_to_add, equal_start_time = update_equal_time(boys, girls, current_time, last_event_time, equal_start_time)
        equal_time += time_to_add
        boys += 1 if event[0] == 'b' and event[1] == 'i' else -1 if event[0] == 'b' else 0
        girls += 1 if event[0] == 'f' and event[1] == 'i' else -1 if event[0] == 'f' else 0
        last_event_time = current_time
    # Update for the last event if condition was met till the end
    if boys == girls and boys != 0 and equal_start_time is not None:
        equal_time += last_event_time - equal_start_time
    return equal_time

def solve_task3(events):
    boys, max_odd_time, current_time, last_odd_start = 0, 0, 0, None
    for event in events:
        hour, minute, second = map(int, event[2:])
        new_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        if boys % 2 == 1 and last_odd_start is None:
            last_odd_start = current_time
        elif boys % 2 == 0 and last_odd_start is not None:
            max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - last_odd_start)
            last_odd_start = None
        boys += 1 if event[0] == 'b' and event[1] == 'i' else -1 if event[0] == 'b' else 0
        current_time = new_time
    if boys % 2 == 1 and last_odd_start is not None:
        max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - last_odd_start)
    return max_odd_time

def main():
    with open('cartele.in', 'r') as file:
        task_number = int(file.readline().strip())
        n_events = int(file.readline().strip())
        events = [line.strip().split() for line in file.readlines()]

    if task_number == 1:
        result = solve_task1(events)
    elif task_number == 2:
        result = solve_task2(events)
    elif task_number == 3:
        result = solve_task3(events)

    with open('cartele.out', 'w') as file:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            file.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{result}\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This corrected code should now calculate the correct amount of time for task 2 by starting the timer whenever the number of boys equals the number of girls (and is non-zero) and stopping the timer whenever this condition is no longer met. The total `equal_time` is incremented accordingly. The fix also ensures that if the condition is met at the last event, the time is updated correctly.

It appears that the previous solution still does not handle the time calculation for task 2 correctly. Based on the input data and the expected result, we have the following events:

- At 0:00:24, a boy enters, so we have 1 boy and 0 girls in school.
- At 0:00:26, a girl enters, balancing the number of boys and girls to 1 each.
- At 0:00:29, a boy exits, disrupting the balance, leaving 0 boys and 1 girl in school.

The expected output is 3 seconds, which is the time from 0:00:26 to 0:00:29 when there was an equal number of boys and girls inside the school. The previous solution failed to account for the fact that the balance was achieved after the first event, and it should have started counting the equal time from the second event (when the girl enters).

Let's fix the code to correctly calculate the time during which there is an equal number of boys and girls in the school:

```python
def get_seconds(hour, minute, second):
    return hour * 3600 + minute * 60 + second

def solve_task1(events):
    boys, girls = 0, 0
    for event in events:
        gender, action = event[0], event[1]
        if gender == 'b':
            boys += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if action == 'i' else -1

This solution should now correctly calculate the equal time between boys and girls for task 2, by starting to count the time when the number of boys and girls becomes equal and is non-zero, and stopping when it becomes unequal. The last condition after the loop ensures that if the number of boys and girls was equal at the end of the events, the time is added correctly.

For task 3, we need to track periods with an odd number of boys and find the longest such period. The incorrect output suggests the implementation is not correctly handling the transitions between even and odd numbers of boys.

The provided example shows the following events:

- At 8:19:10, a girl enters.
- At 8:19:12, a boy enters (1 boy, thus odd).
- At 8:19:13, the girl leaves.
- At 8:19:15, the boy leaves (0 boys, even).
- From 8:20:00 to 8:20:13, five boys enter (5 boys, thus odd).

The expected maximum uninterrupted period with an odd number of boys is 3 seconds. This happens between 8:20:10 and 8:20:13 because before 8:20:10, the number of boys is even.

The current logic for task 3 in the last provided solution incorrectly starts tracking from the first event. It does not handle the transitions correctly. Let's fix the solution for task 3:

```python
def get_seconds(hour, minute, second):
    return hour * 3600 + minute * 60 + second

def solve_task1(events):
    boys, girls = 0, 0
    for event in events:
        gender, action = event[0], event[1]
        if gender == 'b':
            boys += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
    return boys, girls

def solve_task2(events):
    boys, girls, equal_time, last_event_time = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for event in events:
        gender, action, hour, minute, second = event[0], event[1], int(event[2]), int(event[3]), int(event[4])
        current_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        if boys == girls and boys != 0:
            equal_time += current_time - last_event_time
        last_event_time = current_time
        if gender == 'b':
            boys += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
    return equal_time

def solve_task3(events):
    boys, max_odd_time, current_time, last_odd_start = 0, 0, 0, None
    for event in events:
        gender, action, hour, minute, second = event[0], event[1], int(event[2]), int(event[3]), int(event[4])
        current_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        
        if gender == 'b':
            if action == 'i':
                boys += 1
                if boys % 2 == 1 and last_odd_start is None:
                    last_odd_start = current_time
            else:
                if boys % 2 == 1:
                    max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - last_odd_start)
                boys -= 1
                last_odd_start = None if boys % 2 == 0 else current_time
        
        # If the last event has an odd number of boys, and we haven't closed the last odd interval
        if gender == 'b' and action == 'i' and last_odd_start is None and boys % 2 == 1:
            last_odd_start = current_time
    
    # Check after the last event
    if boys % 2 == 1 and last_odd_start is not None:
        max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - last_odd_start)
    
    return max_odd_time

def main():
    with open('cartele.in', 'r') as file:
        task_number = int(file.readline().strip())
        events = [line.strip().split() for line in file.readlines()[1:]]

    if task_number == 1:
        result = solve_task1(events)
    elif task_number == 2:
        result = solve_task2(events)
    elif task_number == 3:
        result = solve_task3(events)

    with open('cartele.out', 'w') as file:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            file.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{result}\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This corrected solution should now track the odd-numbered boy intervals correctly by starting the timing when the number of boys transitions to an odd number and ending it when it transitions back to even. The maximum such interval time is kept track of and updated as needed. The fix also ensures that if the number of boys is odd at the last event, the timing is updated accordingly.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result for task 3 indicates that there's still a mistake in how the periods with an odd number of boys are tracked and how the maximum such period is calculated. Given the input data, we should be tracking the time intervals where there is an odd number of boys inside the school and then find the maximum interval among those.

Let's revise the logic for task 3 to ensure we correctly track these intervals:

1. When a boy enters, if the number of boys was even before, we start a new interval. If the number was odd, we end the current interval and check if it's the longest.
2. When a boy exits, if the number of boys was odd before, we end the current interval and check if it's the longest. If the number was even, we do nothing.

Here's the fixed code for task 3:

```python
def get_seconds(hour, minute, second):
    return hour * 3600 + minute * 60 + second

def solve_task1(events):
    boys, girls = 0, 0
    for event in events:
        gender, action = event[0], event[1]
        if gender == 'b':
            boys += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
    return boys, girls

def solve_task2(events):
    boys, girls, equal_time, last_event_time = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for event in events:
        gender, action, hour, minute, second = event[0], event[1], int(event[2]), int(event[3]), int(event[4])
        current_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        if boys == girls and boys != 0:
            equal_time += current_time - last_event_time
        last_event_time = current_time
        if gender == 'b':
            boys += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
        else:
            girls += 1 if action == 'i' else -1
    return equal_time

def solve_task3(events):
    boys, max_odd_time, current_time, odd_start_time = 0, 0, 0, None
    for event in events:
        gender, action, hour, minute, second = event[0], event[1], int(event[2]), int(event[3]), int(event[4])
        current_time = get_seconds(hour, minute, second)
        
        if gender == 'b':
            if action == 'i':
                if boys % 2 == 0 and odd_start_time is not None:
                    max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - odd_start_time)
                    odd_start_time = None
                boys += 1
            else:
                if boys % 2 == 1:
                    max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - odd_start_time)
                boys -= 1
                odd_start_time = None if boys % 2 == 0 else current_time
        
        # Start timing if the current number of boys is odd and not already timing
        if boys % 2 == 1 and odd_start_time is None:
            odd_start_time = current_time
    
    # Check after the last event if there was an odd number of boys
    if boys % 2 == 1 and odd_start_time is not None:
        max_odd_time = max(max_odd_time, current_time - odd_start_time)
    
    return max_odd_time

def main():
    with open('cartele.in', 'r') as file:
        task_number = int(file.readline().strip())
        events = [line.strip().split() for line in file.readlines()[1:]]

    if task_number == 1:
        result = solve_task1(events)
    elif task_number == 2:
        result = solve_task2(events)
    elif task_number == 3:
        result = solve_task3(events)

    with open('cartele.out', 'w') as file:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            file.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{result}\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This fixed code should now correctly identify and track only the intervals when there is an odd number of boys, updating the maximum duration accordingly. It also handles the case when the last event leaves an odd number of boys inside the school.
