Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

Certainly. It appears that the issue is with how the `t` and `u` values are being read from the file. It seems there might be an off-by-one error or an incorrect assumption about the input format. Let's correct this by adjusting the line indices and ensure we're correctly unpacking the values for `t` and `u`.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to process each trail and determine the minimum number of stops
def process_trails(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    selected_trail = None

    for trail in reversed(trails):

        distances.append(distances[-1] + 1)  # account for the distance to the peak
        stops = 0
        water = t
        prev_source = 0

        for source_distance in distances:
            distance_to_source = source_distance - prev_source
            if water >= distance_to_source:
                water -= distance_to_source  # keep going, water decreases
            elif distance_to_source <= u:   # can reach source without water
                stops += 1
                water = t  # refill water
            else:  # can't reach the next source, trail is not viable
                stops = float('inf')
                break
            prev_source = source_distance

        if stops < min_stops:
            min_stops = stops
            selected_trail = i

    return min_stops, selected_trail

t, u = map(int, lines[k+1].strip().split())  # Correctly parse the line for 't' and 'u'

# Process the trails and get the result
min_stops, selected_trail = process_trails(trails, t, u)

# Prepare output

It seems the error still persists, indicating that the `lines[k+1]` does not contain two separate values as expected. Upon re-examining the input format, we realize that `t` and `u` are on separate lines, and not on the same line. Therefore, `t` should be on `lines[k+1]` and `u` should be on `lines[k+2]`. Let's correct the code to read `t` and `u` properly.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to process each trail and determine the minimum number of stops
def process_trails(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    selected_trail = None

    for trail in reversed(trails):

        water = t
        prev_source = 0

            distance_to_source = source_distance - prev_source
            if water >= distance_to_source:

            elif distance_to_source <= u:   # can reach source without water
                stops += 1
                water = t  # refill water
            else:  # can't reach the next source, trail is not viable
                stops = float('inf')
                break
            prev_source = source_distance

        if stops < min_stops:

The issue seems to be in the algorithm used to determine the number of stops and which trail to select. The current approach may not correctly calculate the number of stops due to a misunderstanding of the problem statement. Let's clarify the logic:

1. We start from the first source.
2. If the remaining water after reaching a source is enough to continue to the next source or to the peak if it's the last source, we don't stop.
3. If we can't make it to the next source or the peak, we must stop to refill, but only if the source is within 'u' distance without water.

The previous solution did not account for the fact that if we need to stop to refill, we should do so at the last source we passed, not the one we couldn't reach.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to process each trail and determine the minimum number of stops
def process_trails(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    selected_trail = None

    for trail in reversed(trails):
        i, r, *distances = trail
        distances.append(distances[-1] + 1)  # account for the distance to the peak
        stops = 0
        water = t
        prev_source = 0

        for idx, source_distance in enumerate(distances):
            distance_to_source = source_distance - prev_source
            if water < distance_to_source:
                # If we cannot reach the next source, we stop at the previous source
                if idx == 0 or distances[idx-1] + u < source_distance:
                    # Can't reach this source even from the previous one, so this trail is not viable
                    stops = float('inf')
                    break
                stops += 1  # stopped at the previous source
                water = t - (source_distance - distances[idx-1])  # refill water and subtract distance from the previous source
            else:
                water -= distance_to_source  # water decreases as we reach the next source
            
            prev_source = source_distance  # update previous source

        if stops < min_stops:

The issue with the current code is that the algorithm for calculating the number of stops is not correctly interpreting the problem's conditions. Specifically, it does not properly account for the scenario where the hiker can reach the peak without having to make an additional stop at the last source.

I will rewrite the algorithm with the following logic:

1. Start from the beginning of the trail and keep track of the remaining water.
2. For each source, check if the hiker can reach it with the current water. If not, make a stop at the previous source (if any) to refill.
3. The hiker must make a stop at the last source if they cannot reach the peak with the remaining water.
4. Keep track of the trail with the fewest stops, preferring the latest trail in case of a tie.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_minimum_stops(trails, t, u):
    min_stops = float('inf')
    selected_trail_number = 0

    for trail in reversed(trails):
        trail_number, num_sources, *sources = trail
        sources.append(sources[-1] + 1)  # Add the peak as the last "source"
        stops = 0
        water = t
        previous_source = 0

        for source in sources:
            if water >= (source - previous_source):
                water -= (source - previous_source)
            else:
                if previous_source + u < source:
                    # Cannot reach this source from the last source or the start
                    stops = float('inf')
                    break
                stops += 1
                water = t - (source - previous_source)
            previous_source = source

        if stops < min_stops:
            min_stops = stops
            selected_trail_number = trail_number

    return min_stops, selected_trail_number

# Read from popas.in
with open('popas.in', 'r') as file:
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    t = int(file.readline().strip())
    u = int(file.readline().strip())

# Determine the minimum number of stops and the trail to select
min_stops, selected_trail_number = calculate_minimum_stops(trails, t, u)

# Write to popas.out
with open('popas.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_stops < float('inf'):
        file.write(f"{min_stops} {selected_trail_number}\n")
    else:
        file.write("0\n")
```
