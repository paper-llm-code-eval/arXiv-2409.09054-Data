Dornic de o condiţie fizică perfectă, un viitor olimpic naţional la informatică îşi propune să escaladeze cea mai înaltă culme a unui un masiv muntos. Se echipează corespunzator, îşi cumpără un termos, *îl umple cu apă*, culege informaţiile despre traseele existente şi completează astfel fişierul de intrare `popas.in`. Pe parcursul fiecărui traseu există mai multe izvoare de la care drumeţul îşi poate umple termosul. Ştiind că pe munte este bine să mergi cu pas constant şi fără ruperi de ritm, îşi propune să atingă culmea facând *cât mai puţine popasuri (pentru umplerea termosului)*. 

# Cerință

Dintre toate traseele existente către culme determinaţi-l pe cel pentru care **numărul total de popasuri este minim**. Dacă sunt mai multe astfel de trasee, se va alege cel care este scris ultimul în fişierul de intrare.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul `popas.in` conţine:
- pe prima linie, $k$ - numărul total de trasee către culme
- pe fiecare dintre următoarele $k$ linii descrierea câte unui traseu (pe fiecare linie numerele sunt separate prin câte un spaţiu), adică:
	- $i$ - numărul asociat traseului (fiecare traseu este identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural cuprins între $1$ şi $k$)
	- $r$ - numărul izvoarelor cu apă rece de pe traseu
	- $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_r$ – $r$ numere reprezentând distanţa de la punctul de plecare până la fiecare izvor
- pe ultimele două linii:
	- t distanţa pentru care drumeţului îi este suficientă apa din termos
 	- u distanţa pe care drumeţul o poate străbate fără apă 

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul `popas.out` va conţine pe aceeasi linie, despărţite prin spaţiu, două numere: primul reprezintă numărul minim de popasuri necesare deplasarii şi al doilea numărul traseului ales. Dacă problema nu are soluţie fişierul de ieşire va conţine cifra$ 0$.


# Restricții și precizări

* În fişierul de intrare toate distanţele sunt exprimate în kilometri
* Pentru fiecare traseu distanţa dintre ultimul izvor (cel mai îndepărtat de punctul de plecare) şi culme este de $1$ kilometru
* $0 < k \leq 100$; 
* $0 < r \leq 20$; 
* $0 < di \leq 360$; 
* $1 \leq t \leq 10$; 
* $1 \leq u \leq 5$;

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Function to calculate the minimum number of stops needed for a given trail
def calculate_stops(dists, t, u):

    for dist in dists:
        if dist > max_dist:
            stops += 1
            max_dist = dist + t
        if max_dist >= dist + u:
            break
    return stops

# Read data from the file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Extract the number of trails, the distance for which the water is enough and 
# the distance that can be covered without water
k = int(lines[0].strip())
trails = [list(map(int, line.strip().split()[1:])) for line in lines[1:k+1]]
t, u = map(int, lines[k+1:])

# Determine the minimum number of stops and the trail with the minimum stops
min_stops = np.inf
min_trail = -1
for i, trail in enumerate(reversed(trails), 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    # If a new minimum is found or the current trail has the same number of
    # stops as the minimum and is later in the list, then update the minimum
    if stops <= min_stops:
        min_stops = stops
        min_trail = k - i + 1

# Write the result to the file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as f:
    # If no solution is found (min_stops is np.inf), write 0
    if min_stops == np.inf:
        f.write('0\n')
    else:
        # Otherwise, write the minimum number of stops and the trail number
        f.write(f'{min_stops} {min_trail}\n')
```

This Python code defines a function to calculate the minimum number of stops required for a given trail, reads input from `popas.in`, processes the trails in reverse order to fulfill the condition of choosing the last trail if multiple trails have the same minimum number of stops, and writes the result to `popas.out`. It uses `numpy` to set an initial value of infinity (`np.inf`) for the minimum number of stops. Additionally, it uses list comprehension to process the trail data, and it accounts for the limit where the hiker runs out of water by breaking the loop early in the `calculate_stops` function.

The error indicates that `numpy` is not available in the environment where the code is being run. Since numpy cannot be used due to the environment limitations and we have to optimize for memory usage, we will need to avoid numpy and use pure Python to handle the calculations.

Here is the complete solution without using numpy:

```python
# Read data from the file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Extract the number of trails, the distance for which the water is enough
# and the distance that can be covered without water
k = int(lines[0].strip())
trails = [list(map(int, line.strip().split()[1:])) for line in lines[1:k+1]]
t, u = map(int, lines[k+1:])

# Function to calculate the minimum number of stops needed for a given trail
def calculate_stops(dists, t, u):
    stops = 0
    max_dist = t
    for dist in dists:
        if dist > max_dist:
            stops += 1
            max_dist = dist + t
        if max_dist >= dist + u:
            break
    return stops

# Determine the minimum number of stops and the trail with the minimum stops
min_stops = float('inf')  # Using float('inf') instead of np.inf
min_trail = -1
for i, trail in enumerate(reversed(trails), 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    # If a new minimum is found or the current trail has the same number of
    # stops as the minimum and is later in the list, then update the minimum
    if stops <= min_stops:
        min_stops = stops
        min_trail = k - i + 1

# Write the result to the file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as f:
    # If no solution is found (min_stops is float('inf')), write 0
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        f.write('0\n')
    else:
        # Otherwise, write the minimum number of stops and the trail number
        f.write(f'{min_stops} {min_trail}\n')
```

This solution follows the same logic as the previous one but uses the standard Python `float('inf')` to represent an infinite number of stops for comparison purposes, which is a common practice in Python when numpy is not available. The rest of the program remains unchanged, as it did not rely on numpy-specific functions.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it's clear that the output from the code does not match the expected result. The issue lies in the implementation of the `calculate_stops` function and how it processes the input data.

The logic should ensure that the termos (water bottle) is refilled only when necessary, and it should always consider the distance that can be walked without water (`u`) after the last source of water is reached. It looks like the original implementation did not take into account the final stretch of the trail after the last water source. Also, it is important to remember that the distance between the last water source and the peak is 1 kilometer.

Let's correct the `calculate_stops` function and the overall logic to ensure we get the correct number of stops and choose the appropriate trail:

```python
# Read data from the file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as f:
    k = int(f.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(k)]
    t, u = map(int, f.readline().strip().split())

# Function to calculate the minimum number of stops needed for a given trail
def calculate_stops(dists, t, u):
    stops = 0
    max_dist = t
    for dist in dists:
        if dist > max_dist:
            stops += 1
            max_dist = dist + t
    # After the last source, check if there is enough water to reach the peak
    if max_dist < dists[-1] + 1 + u:
        stops += 1
    return stops

# Determine the minimum number of stops and the trail with the minimum stops
min_stops = float('inf')
min_trail = -1
for i, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(trail[1:], t, u)
    # If a new minimum is found or it's the same and the trail number is larger, update
    if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and i > min_trail):
        min_stops = stops
        min_trail = i

# Write the result to the file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as f:
    # If no solution is found (min_stops is float('inf')), write 0
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        f.write('0\n')
    else:
        # Otherwise, write the minimum number of stops and the trail number
        f.write(f'{min_stops} {min_trail}\n')
```

In this updated solution, we corrected the `calculate_stops` function to check if there is enough water to reach the peak after the last water source. Additionally, we are iterating through the trails in the order they are provided and update the `min_trail` with the current trail number `i` only if the number of stops is strictly less than the current `min_stops` or if the number of stops is the same but the trail number is greater (since we want the last trail in case of a tie). This should produce the correct output as expected.

The error indicates that there is a `ValueError` on line 5, where the program is trying to read more values than are available in the line. This is likely because we are incorrectly assuming that `t` and `u` are on the same line after the trail descriptions, but based on the input data format, `t` and `u` are on two separate lines.

Let's correct the code to read `t` and `u` from two consecutive lines:

```python
# Correctly read t and u from two consecutive lines
with open('popas.in', 'r') as f:
    k = int(f.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(k)]
    t = int(f.readline().strip())
    u = int(f.readline().strip())

# Function to calculate the minimum number of stops needed for a given trail
def calculate_stops(dists, t, u):
    stops = 0
    max_dist = t
    for dist in dists:
        if dist > max_dist:
            stops += 1
            max_dist = dist + t
    # After the last source, check if there is enough water to reach the peak
    if max_dist < dists[-1] + 1 + u:
        stops += 1
    return stops

# Determine the minimum number of stops and the trail with the minimum stops
min_stops = float('inf')
min_trail = -1
for i, trail in enumerate(trails, 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(trail, t, u)
    # If a new minimum is found or it's the same and the trail number is larger, update
    if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and i > min_trail):
        min_stops = stops
        min_trail = i

# Write the result to the file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as f:
    # If no solution is found (min_stops is float('inf')), write 0
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        f.write('0\n')
    else:
        # Otherwise, write the minimum number of stops and the trail number
        f.write(f'{min_stops} {min_trail}\n')
```

In this fixed solution, `t` and `u` are read from two separate lines as they should be, according to the input data format. The rest of the program remains unchanged. This should fix the `ValueError` and ensure that the program reads the input correctly and produces the expected output.

The issue with the previous solution is that it selected the trail with the highest number in the case of ties for the minimum number of stops, which is incorrect based on the problem statement that requires selecting the last one written in the file.

The code should keep the trail with the higher index in the order it appears in the file, meaning we should prefer a trail that is found later in the file in the case of ties, not necessarily the one with the higher trail number.

The correct approach is to iterate over the trails in the original order they are given, and only update the chosen trail if a trail with fewer stops is found or if the number of stops is the same but the trail appears later in the file. The last condition can be achieved by simply updating the trail whenever we find an equal number of stops since we are traversing the list from beginning to end.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the minimum number of stops needed for a given trail
def calculate_stops(dists, t, u):
    stops = 0
    max_dist = 0  # Start with 0 distance covered
    for dist in dists:
        if dist - max_dist > t:
            stops += 1  # Make a stop if the next source is too far
            max_dist = dist  # Refill the termos
    # Check if we can reach the peak from the last source without stopping
    if max_dist + t < dists[-1] + 1:
        stops += 1  # Need one last stop at the final source
    return stops

# Read data from the file
with open('popas.in', 'r') as f:
    k = int(f.readline().strip())
    trails = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split()))[1:] for _ in range(k)]
    t = int(f.readline().strip())
    u = int(f.readline().strip())

min_stops = float('inf')
min_trail = 0

# Iterate over the trails and calculate stops for each
for i, dists in enumerate(trails, 1):
    stops = calculate_stops(dists, t, u)
    # Update min_stops and min_trail if this trail is better or the same but later in the file
    if stops < min_stops or (stops == min_stops and i > min_trail):
        min_stops = stops
        min_trail = i

# Write the result to the file
with open('popas.out', 'w') as f:
    if min_stops == float('inf'):
        f.write('0\n')
    else:
        f.write(f'{min_stops} {min_trail}\n')
```

This corrected solution should produce the expected output, selecting the correct trail when multiple trails have the same minimum number of stops. The `calculate_stops` function has also been adjusted to consider the last 1 kilometer distance to the peak.
