Zarul folosit la diverse jocuri este un cub care are desenat pe fiecare față a sa $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ sau $6$ puncte. Pe un zar nu există două fețe cu același număr de puncte și suma punctelor de pe oricare două fețe opuse este egală cu $7$.

Pe o masă de joc este desenat un traseu în formă de pătrat, cu latura de dimensiune $n$. Fiecare latură a traseului este împărțită în $n$ pătrățele identice, care au latura egală cu cea a zarului. Zarul este așezat inițial în colțul din stânga sus al traseului și apoi rostogolit de pe o față pe alta, din pătrățel în pătrățel, de-a lungul traseului parcurs în sensul acelor de ceasornic.

În orice moment ne-am uita la zar, putem vedea numărul punctelor desenate pe trei din fețele sale (așa cum se vede în desenul de mai sus).

Notăm cu $f_1$ fața cubului orientată spre noi, $f_2$ fața superioară a cubului, respectiv cu $f_3$ fața laterală din dreapta. Pentru exemplul din figură: $n = 4$, fața dinspre noi ($f_1$) conține trei puncte, fața superioară ($f_2$) conține două puncte, fața laterală din dreapta ($f_3$) conține un punct, iar sensul de deplasare este cel precizat prin săgeți.

# Cerință

Cunoscând dimensiunea $n$ a traseului și numărul punctelor de pe cele trei fețe ale zarului în poziția inițială, determinați după $k$ rostogoliri numărul punctelor ce se pot observa pe fiecare din cele trei fețe ale zarului.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `zar.in` conține pe prima linie numerele naturale $n$ și $k$ despărțite printr-un spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află trei numere naturale separate prin spații ce corespund numărului de puncte de pe fețele $f_1, f_2$, respectiv $f_3$ ale zarului în poziția inițială.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `zar.out` va conține o singură linie cu trei numere naturale separate prin câte un spațiu, care reprezintă numărul punctelor ce se pot observa pe fețele $f_1$, $f_2$ și $f_3$ (în această ordine) după ce au fost efectuate $k$ rostogoliri pe traseul dat.

# Restricții și precizări

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read data from input file
with open('zar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the initial opposite faces
f4 = 7 - f1
f5 = 7 - f2
f6 = 7 - f3

# Define the roll transformations
transformations = {
    'right': np.array([[0, 4, 2], [1, 5, 3], [7 - f for f in [0, 4, 2]]]),
    'down':  np.array([[1, 0, 3], [7 - f for f in [1, 0, 3]], [2, 5, 4]]),
    'left':  np.array([[0, 4, 2], [1, 5, 3], [7 - f for f in [0, 4, 2]]]),
    'up':    np.array([[1, 0, 3], [7 - f for f in [1, 0, 3]], [2, 5, 4]]),
}

# Determine the number of full rounds and the remaining rolls
rounds = k // (4 * (n - 1))
remaining_rolls = k % (4 * (n - 1))

# Initial face values
faces = np.array([f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6])

# Apply the full rounds to the faces
if rounds % 2 == 1:
    faces = faces[transformations['right'][0]]

# Simulate the remaining rolls
directions = ['right', 'down', 'left', 'up']
for _ in range(remaining_rolls):
    n_turns = n - 1
    for direction in directions:
        rolls = min(n_turns, remaining_rolls)
        transform = transformations[direction]
        faces[:3] = faces[transform[rolls % 4]]
        remaining_rolls -= rolls
        if remaining_rolls == 0:
            break
        n_turns = n

# Write output to file
with open('zar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{faces[0]} {faces[1]} {faces[2]}\n")
```

This solution takes into account the restrictions on memory by using a fixed number of variables and working with numpy arrays efficiently. The transformations dictionary stores the changes in positions of the faces for a roll in each direction, taking into account that after 4 rolls in the same direction, the faces will return to their initial state. We first calculate the number of complete rounds that take us back to the initial state (possibly in a rotated manner) and then simulate the remaining rolls. The solution is written to the `zar.out` file as required. The efficiency of this code should meet the challenge requirements.

The exit code indicates that the `numpy` library is not available in the execution environment. Since the challenge specifies a memory limit and the need to optimize both time and memory usage, we should avoid using external libraries like numpy that may not be available and could potentially consume additional memory.

We can solve this problem using only built-in Python data structures and functions, which should be more memory efficient. Here's how we can rewrite the solution without using numpy or any other external library:

```python
# Read data from input file
with open('zar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the opposite faces
f4, f5, f6 = 7 - f1, 7 - f2, 7 - f3

# Define the roll transformations
def roll_right(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f3, f2, f4, f6, f5, f1

def roll_down(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f5, f1, f3, f2, f6, f4

def roll_left(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f6, f2, f1, f3, f5, f4

def roll_up(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f2, f6, f3, f1, f4, f5

# Determine number of full rounds and remaining rolls
full_round_rolls = 4 * (n - 1)
rounds = k // full_round_rolls
remaining_rolls = k % full_round_rolls

# Simulate the rolls
# After each full round, the die returns to its initial orientation
# Thus, we only need to simulate the remaining rolls
directions = [roll_right, roll_down, roll_left, roll_up]

# Apply full rounds to the faces (affects opposite faces only)
if rounds % 2 == 1:
    f1, f4 = f4, f1
    f2, f5 = f5, f2
    f3, f6 = f6, f3

# Simulate the remaining rolls
for _ in range(remaining_rolls):
    # Determine direction of roll
    roll_direction = directions[0]
    # Roll the die
    f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6 = roll_direction(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6)
    # Move to next direction every (n - 1) rolls
    if remaining_rolls % (n - 1) == 0:
        directions = directions[1:] + directions[:1]

# Write output to file
with open('zar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{f1} {f2} {f3}\n")
```

Upon reviewing the code and the error in the output, it's evident that the roll simulation logic is not working correctly. The code is not properly keeping track of the direction changes after each side of the square has been traversed, and the cycle of directions should be applied after every `(n - 1)` rolls, not on the remaining rolls itself. The logic to handle the direction after each `(n - 1)` rolls seems to be incorrect.

Let's fix the bug in the code while maintaining the simple approach without using external libraries and correctly simulating the remaining rolls:

```python
# Read data from input file
with open('zar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the opposite faces
f4, f5, f6 = 7 - f1, 7 - f2, 7 - f3

# Define the roll transformations
def roll_right(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f3, f2, f4, f6, f5, f1

def roll_down(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f5, f1, f3, f2, f6, f4

def roll_left(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f6, f2, f1, f3, f5, f4

def roll_up(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6):
    return f2, f6, f3, f1, f4, f5

# Determine the number of full rounds and remaining rolls
full_round_rolls = 4 * (n - 1)
rounds = k // full_round_rolls
remaining_rolls = k % full_round_rolls

# Apply full rounds to the faces (affects opposite faces only)
if rounds % 2 == 1:
    f1, f4 = f4, f1
    f2, f5 = f5, f2
    f3, f6 = f6, f3

# Simulate the remaining rolls
while remaining_rolls > 0:
    for roll_func in (roll_right, roll_down, roll_left, roll_up):
        for _ in range(min(n - 1, remaining_rolls)):
            f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6 = roll_func(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6)
            remaining_rolls -= 1
        if remaining_rolls == 0:
            break

# Write output to file
with open('zar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{f1} {f2} {f3}\n")
```

This code should correctly simulate the roll of the dice after each full round and properly handle the remaining rolls, changing the direction after traversing each side of the square. The output should now match the expected result, correctly representing the final state of the die after `k` rolls.

The error in the output indicates that while the rolls are being simulated somewhat correctly, the direction of the roll is not being handled correctly. This is causing the die's faces to not be in the expected positions after the given number of rolls. 

Let's correct the logic by taking into account the direction of each roll and ensuring that the correct transformation is applied at each step. We will also simplify the code by using a linear sequence of rolls rather than explicitly handling full rounds since the final position does not depend on intermediate positions.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read data from input file
with open('zar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Function to simulate a single roll
def roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction):
    if direction == 'right':
        return f3, f2, 7 - f1
    elif direction == 'down':
        return f1, 7 - f3, f2
    elif direction == 'left':
        return 7 - f3, f2, f1
    elif direction == 'up':
        return f1, f3, 7 - f2

# Function to get the current direction of the roll
def get_direction(roll_num, n):
    if roll_num < n:
        return 'right'
    elif roll_num < 2 * n - 1:
        return 'down'
    elif roll_num < 3 * n - 2:
        return 'left'
    else:
        return 'up'

# Simulate the rolls
for roll_num in range(k):
    direction = get_direction(roll_num, n)
    f1, f2, f3 = roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction)

# Write output to file
with open('zar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{f1} {f2} {f3}\n")
```

This code takes into account the direction of the roll at each step and rolls the dice accordingly. It calculates the direction based on the roll number and the side length `n`. After simulating all `k` rolls, it writes the final face values to the output file. This should now provide the correct output.

It appears that the code is still not correctly handling the direction changes after traversing each side of the square. The logic to determine the direction of each roll based on the roll number is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the die returns to the starting position after completing a full cycle around the square.

Let's correct this by accounting for the number of completed cycles and adjusting the roll number accordingly. We will also improve the logic for determining the direction based on the adjusted roll number.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read data from the input file
with open('zar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Define the roll transformations for each direction
def roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction):
    if direction == 0:  # roll to the right
        return 7 - f3, f2, f1
    elif direction == 1:  # roll downwards
        return f3, f1, 7 - f2
    elif direction == 2:  # roll to the left
        return f3, 7 - f2, f1
    else:  # roll upwards
        return 7 - f1, f2, f3

# Calculate the number of full cycles and the remaining rolls
cycle = (n - 1) * 4
num_cycles = k // cycle
k %= cycle

# After completing cycles, the dice returns to its original orientation
# Determine the final position only based on the remaining k
for i in range(k):
    direction = i // (n - 1) % 4
    f1, f2, f3 = roll_dice(f1, f2, f3, direction)

# Write output to file
with open('zar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{f1} {f2} {f3}\n")
```

This version calculates the direction based on the current roll number within a cycle and applies the transformations accordingly. After completing any full cycles, we only need to consider the remaining rolls (`k` after modding by `cycle`), which simplifies the problem. The code now should give the expected output after `k` rolls.

Upon reviewing the previous solutions, it's clear that the logic to simulate the rolls was incorrect. The direction logic is not accurately computing the state of the die after each roll, particularly after completing a side of the square.

A more robust approach is to simulate each roll step by step, updating the state of the die while keeping track of the current position and direction. The die moves to the right first, then down, left, and finally up, repeating this cycle.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct logic to simulate the movement of the die along the square path:

```python
# Read data from the input file
with open('zar.in', 'r') as file:
    n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    f1, f2, f3 = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate opposite faces
opposite = {1: 6, 2: 5, 3: 4, 4: 3, 5: 2, 6: 1}

# Roll the die in the current direction and update the faces
def roll(f1, f2, f3, direction):
    if direction == 'right':
        return opposite[f3], f2, f1
    elif direction == 'down':
        return f3, opposite[f1], f2
    elif direction == 'left':
        return opposite[f3], f2, f1
    else:  # up
        return f3, f1, opposite[f2]

# Simulate the roll
directions_order = ['right', 'down', 'left', 'up']
direction = 0  # Start by rolling to the right
side_length = n - 1  # Number of moves in the current direction
steps_moved = 0  # Number of moves taken in the current direction

for _ in range(k):
    # Roll the die
    f1, f2, f3 = roll(f1, f2, f3, directions_order[direction])
    steps_moved += 1
    
    # Change direction if we reach the end of a side of the square
    if steps_moved == side_length:
        direction = (direction + 1) % 4  # Change direction in clockwise order
        steps_moved = 0
        # Reduce the side length by 1 after completing a lap
        if direction == 0 or direction == 2:
            side_length -= 1

# Write output to the file
with open('zar.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{f1} {f2} {f3}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly simulate the dice rolls and produce the expected output. It carefully manages the direction changes and side lengths to determine the die's state after each roll. The output written to `zar.out` should match the expected result.
