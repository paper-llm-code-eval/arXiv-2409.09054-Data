Construcția unei noi clădiri a fost finalizată! Frank, celebrul arhitect a  făcut o poză cu fațada. Nu este chiar mulțumit de poză deoarece a observat o înclinație a pozei relativ la orizontală. Asta se poate repara printr-o rotație, iar Frank se întreabă dacă procesul de îndreptare nu ar putea fi automatizat.

Cu acest scop, imaginea este transformată într-o mulțime de segmente din plan, detectate automat cu algoritmi speciali, ca în imaginea din dreapta. Segmentele care se obțin sunt identificate prin cele două extremități, puncte având coordonate numere naturale, în sistemul *xOy*: ($x_1$, $y_1$), ($x_2$, $y_2$). Un segment este numit *aliniat* cu axele dacă este orizontal (paralel cu axa *Ox*, deci $y_1=y_2$) sau vertical (paralel cu axa *Oy*, deci $x_1=x_2$).
Prin rotația imaginii în ansamblu, o parte dintre segmente devin *aliniate* cu cele două axe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care pentru o mulțime de segmente determină numărul maxim de segmente care se pot *alinia*, prin rotirea cu un același unghi a tuturor segmentelor. Unghiul de rotație poate fi orice număr real.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `arhitect.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul de segmente $N$ și pe următoarele $N$ linii câte patru numere întregi separate prin câte un spațiu $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, în această ordine, cu semnificația din enunț, coordonatele ce definesc extremitățile segmentelor.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `arhitect.out` conține pe prima linie numărul maxim de segmente determinat.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$ și $1 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;
* Toate segmentele au lungime nenulă;
* Pentru $40$ de puncte, segmentele inițiale sunt paralele cu *Ox*, *Oy* sau cu bisectoarele axelor de coordonate.
* Pentru $60$ de puncte, fără resticții suplimentare.

max_aligned_segments = max(directions_count.values())

# Write the result to the output file
with open('arhitect.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_aligned_segments))
```

This solution reads segments from an input file and calculates the most frequently occurring "normalized" direction vector, which represents the number of segments that can be aligned by rotating the image. It then writes the maximum number of aligned segments to an output file. This solution is optimized for both time and memory usage, avoiding any unnecessary memory allocation and utilizes integer arithmetic for normalization to ensure the lowest memory footprint possible.

It appears that the program is exiting with code 1 due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`. Since the original problem statement does not require the use of `numpy` and also considering the memory constraints, we can eliminate the use of `numpy`. Here is the rewritten solution without using `numpy`:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

# Function to normalize a vector (dx, dy) to its simplest form
def normalize(dx, dy):
    if dx == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    elif dy == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        divisor = gcd(dx, dy)
        return (dx // divisor, dy // divisor)

# Dictionary to store the frequency of each direction vector
directions_count = defaultdict(int)

# Read the data from the input file
with open('arhitect.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    segments = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Iterate over segments and calculate direction vectors in their simplest form
for (x1, y1, x2, y2) in segments:
    dx, dy = x2 - x1, y2 - y1
    normalized_direction = normalize(dx, dy)
    directions_count[normalized_direction] += 1

# Find the maximum frequency of any direction vector
max_aligned_segments = max(directions_count.values())

# Write the result to the output file
with open('arhitect.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_aligned_segments))
```

This code reads segment data from the file `arhitect.in`, processes the information to find the most common normalized direction vector, and then writes the maximum number of alignable segments to the file `arhitect.out`. This solution does not utilize external libraries like `numpy`, making it fully compliant with the standard Python library, and respecting the memory limit of ~8MB.

The incorrect output suggests that the algorithm isn't correctly identifying the number of segments that can be aligned through rotation.

The current algorithm calculates the direction vector of each segment and attempts to normalize it to its simplest form, counting the occurrences of each direction. However, this approach fails to account for the fact that segments can be aligned by rotating them to either the horizontal or vertical position, not just in their current direction. Two segments can be aligned if they are on the same line or if their direction vectors are perpendicular to each other, which means their dot product should be zero.

To fix the solution, we need to change our approach from counting normalized direction vectors to checking if the segments can form a horizontal or vertical line after rotation.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

# Function to calculate the greatest common divisor (needed for Python versions < 3.5)
def my_gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return abs(x)

# Use the built-in gcd function if available, otherwise use the custom one
gcd_function = gcd if hasattr(math, 'gcd') else my_gcd

# Function to normalize a slope (dy, dx) to its simplest form where dx >= 0
def normalize(dy, dx):
    if dx == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    if dy == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    g = gcd_function(abs(dy), abs(dx))
    dy //= g
    dx //= g
    if dx < 0:  # Make sure dx is non-negative
        dy = -dy
        dx = -dx
    return (dy, dx)

# Read the data from the input file
with open('arhitect.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    slope_count = defaultdict(int)

    # Process each segment
    for _ in range(n):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().split())
        dy = y2 - y1
        dx = x2 - x1
        slope = normalize(dy, dx)
        slope_count[slope] += 1

# Find the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating
max_aligned_segments = max(slope_count.values())

# Write the result to the output file
with open('arhitect.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_aligned_segments))
```

This solution uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each unique normalized slope (which is the same as the direction vector but makes sure that `dx` is non-negative for uniqueness). The normalized slope replaces the original direction vector normalization since it's sufficient to represent unique lines that segments can belong to. The maximum count in this dictionary will be the number of segments that can be aligned by rotation. The solution writes this maximum count to the output file `arhitect.out`.

The exit code 1 indicates that there is a `NameError` in the code. This error is caused because I referred to a `math` module without actually importing it or defining it. However, since we only need the `gcd` function from the `math` module, we can directly use the built-in `gcd` function that is available in Python 3, which we already imported at the top of the code.

Let's fix this by removing the unnecessary check for `math.gcd` and directly using the `gcd` function we imported:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

# Function to normalize a slope (dy, dx) to its simplest form where dx >= 0
def normalize(dy, dx):
    if dx == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    if dy == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    g = gcd(abs(dy), abs(dx))
    dy //= g
    dx //= g
    if dx < 0:  # Make sure dx is non-negative
        dy = -dy
        dx = -dx
    return (dy, dx)

# Read the data from the input file
with open('arhitect.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    slope_count = defaultdict(int)

    # Process each segment
    for _ in range(n):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().split())
        dy = y2 - y1
        dx = x2 - x1
        slope = normalize(dy, dx)
        slope_count[slope] += 1

# Find the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotating
max_aligned_segments = max(slope_count.values())

# Write the result to the output file
with open('arhitect.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_aligned_segments))
```

This corrected solution will read the segments data from `arhitect.in`, calculate the normalized slopes for each segment, count the frequency of each unique slope, find the maximum frequency, and then write that maximum frequency to `arhitect.out`. This should now work correctly without causing a `NameError`.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output indicates that there is a flaw in the logic of the solution. The current solution counts the frequency of each unique normalized slope. However, the problem statement asks for the number of segments that can be aligned by any rotation, not only the ones that have the same slope.

To align the segments, we need to consider that a segment can become horizontal or vertical after rotation if its endpoints are rotated about the origin to the same y-coordinate or x-coordinate, respectively.

This means that we need to consider the difference in x-coordinates (dx) and y-coordinates (dy) for each segment individually rather than normalizing them to a slope. Segments that have the same absolute dx or dy can be rotated to become aligned.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_difference(point1, point2):
    return abs(point1 - point2)

# Read the data from the input file
with open('arhitect.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    differences = defaultdict(int)

    for _ in range(n):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, file.readline().split())
        dx = calculate_difference(x1, x2)
        dy = calculate_difference(y1, y2)
        # Increment the count for both differences
        differences[dx] += 1
        differences[dy] += 1

# Find the maximum number of segments that can be aligned by rotation
max_aligned_segments = max(differences.values())

# Write the result to the output file
with open('arhitect.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_aligned_segments))
```

In this solution, we store the absolute differences of x-coordinates and y-coordinates for each segment in a dictionary and count their occurrences. The maximum value obtained from this dictionary will be the maximum number of segments that can be aligned after any rotation. The result is then written to the file `arhitect.out`. This logic should produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

The result is incorrect because the previous solution does not properly account for the process of aligning segments through rotation. To correctly determine the number of segments that can be aligned, we must consider the angle of rotation that would align each segment to be either horizontal or vertical. Segments with the same angle of rotation can be aligned together. The angle of rotation for a segment to become aligned can be represented by its normalized directional vector (dx, dy), with dx and dy being the differences in x and y coordinates between the endpoints of each segment.

Here is a revised solution that should correctly calculate the number of segments that can be aligned:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

def normalize(dx, dy):
    if dx == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    if dy == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    divisor = gcd(dx, dy)
    return (dx // divisor, dy // divisor)

# Read the data from the input file
with open('arhitect.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    segments = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Dictionary to count the occurrences of each direction vector
direction_counts = defaultdict(int)

# Calculate normalized direction vectors for each segment and count their occurrences
for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    direction = normalize(dx, dy)
    direction_counts[direction] += 1

# Calculate normalized direction vectors for each segment rotated by 90 degrees
# and count their occurrences
for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
    dx = y2 - y1
    dy = x1 - x2
    direction = normalize(dx, dy)
    direction_counts[direction] += 1

# Find the maximum count of any direction vector
max_aligned_segments = max(direction_counts.values())

# Write the result to the output file
with open('arhitect.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(max_aligned_segments))
```

This solution calculates the normalized direction vectors for each segment and also for each segment rotated by 90 degrees. We must consider both the original and rotated segments because rotating the entire set of segments by an angle could align a subset of them to be horizontal and another subset to be vertical. The direction vector that occurs most frequently represents the maximum number of segments that can be aligned. The corrected solution writes this number to the output file `arhitect.out`.
