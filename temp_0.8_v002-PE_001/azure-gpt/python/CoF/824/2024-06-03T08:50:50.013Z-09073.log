Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_values = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Initialize an array to store the triangle with unknown values
triangle = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=np.int64)

# Fill in the known values in the triangle
for row_idx, (pos, value) in enumerate(known_values[::-1], start=1):
    triangle[-row_idx, pos - 1] = value

# Bottom-up approach to calculate the values on the first line
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    for j in range(i):
        if triangle[i, j] != 0 and triangle[i, j + 1] != 0:
            triangle[i - 1, j] = triangle[i, j] - triangle[i - 1, j + 1]

# Write the output
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, triangle[0, :n])))
```

Explanation:
- The solution reads the input from 'triunghi.in' and stores the known values in the list `known_values`.
- A `triangle` array is initialized with zeros to hold all values of the triangle.
- The known values are filled into the `triangle` array in reverse order, starting from the bottom row.
- The algorithm then fills in the first line of the triangle using the known values and the property that each element is the sum of the two elements directly below it.
- Finally, the first line of the triangle is written to 'triunghi.out'.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available or not installed in the environment where the program is being executed. Since the challenge specifies optimizing both time and memory usage, and considering that `numpy` is not allowed, I will rewrite the solution using only standard Python data structures. Here is the fixed solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Read the input
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_values = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file.readlines()]

# Initialize a 2D list to store the triangle with unknown values
triangle = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

# Fill in the known values in the triangle
for idx, (pos, value) in enumerate(known_values[::-1], start=1):
    triangle[-idx][pos - 1] = value

# Bottom-up approach to calculate the values on the first line
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    for j in range(i):
        # Check if the two elements directly below are known to calculate the current element
        if triangle[i][j] and triangle[i][j + 1]:
            triangle[i - 1][j] = triangle[i][j] - triangle[i - 1][j + 1]

# Extract the first line of the triangle
first_line = triangle[0][:n]

# Write the output
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, first_line)))
```

Explanation for the changes:
- Removed the import of `numpy` and replaced the `numpy` array with a 2D list (`triangle`).
- Adjusted indexing to work with the 2D list instead of a `numpy` array.
- The logic remains mostly the same, filling in the known values from bottom to top.
- The output is written to 'triunghi.out' using the standard file writing approach in Python.

The issue with the previous code is that it assumes that we can directly infer the value of a number in the triangle only by looking at the two numbers below it. However, the problem statement implies that we are given one number per row, and we must use all this information together to infer the values of the first row.

The algorithm needs to be changed to work from the given numbers up to the first row by calculating the impact of each known value on the row above until we reach the first row.

Here's an updated solution to approach the problem correctly:

```python
# Read the input
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    # Read the known values and their positions
    known_values = [list(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Calculate the coefficients needed to deduce the first row
coefficients = [1] * n
for i in range(n - 1):
    pos, _ = known_values[i]
    # Update the coefficients for the next iteration (next row)
    for j in range(pos - 1, n - i):
        coefficients[j] += coefficients[j - 1]

# Now, we use the known values and coefficients to deduce the first row
first_row = [0] * n
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    pos, value = known_values[i]
    # Deduce the value at the given position of the first row
    # by using the inverse of the coefficient and subtracting the already known contributions
    # from the values in the first row
    value -= sum(coefficients[j] * first_row[j] for j in range(n - i - 1, n))
    first_row[n - i - 1] = value // coefficients[n - i - 1]

# Write the output
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, first_row)))
```

Explanation of the changes and logic:
- We calculate the coefficients that will be used to deduce the values in the first row. These coefficients represent the number of paths from a given position in a row to the positions in the first row. This is done by iterating over the rows and updating the coefficients array.
- We iterate over the known values in reverse order (from bottom row to the first row) and use the coefficients to calculate the values in the first row.
- The `//` operator is used to perform integer division since all numbers in the triangle are natural numbers.
- The final first-row values are written to 'triunghi.out'.

The issue with the previous implementations is that we were not correctly backtracking the information from the known values up through the triangle to correctly infer the first line. The algorithm needs to consider the known values and work way up to the first line, inferring the unknown values on the way, taking into account that each value is the sum of the two values below it.

Let's fix the logic. We will calculate all the values of the triangle by backtracking from the known values provided on each line.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_values = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize a list to store the first line of the triangle
first_line = [0] * n

# Backtrack from the known values to calculate the first line values
for line in range(n-1, 0, -1):
    pos, value = known_values[line]
    # Calculate the difference to apply to the first line
    diff = value
    for i in range(line, 0, -1):
        pos, _ = known_values[i-1]
        diff -= first_line[pos-1]

    # Apply half of the difference to the two values in the first line that correspond to the position
    first_line[pos-2] += diff // 2
    first_line[pos-1] += diff - diff // 2

# The first value of the first line is the known value from the last line minus the sum of the other values
first_line[0] = known_values[0][1] - sum(first_line[1:])

# Write the output
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, first_line)))
```

Explanation of the changes and logic:
- We start from the second to the last line of the known values and move up to the second line.
- For each known value, we calculate the difference between the known value and the sum of the values already calculated on the first line that corresponds to the known value's position.
- We then distribute this difference to the two positions on the first line that would contribute to the current position in the triangle.
- For the top value of the triangle, we subtract the sum of the other values on the first line from the known value of the top line to get the correct value.
- Finally, we write the first line values to 'triunghi.out'.

The earlier approach incorrectly attempted to backtrack from the known values, but the proper way to solve this problem is to iteratively build the triangle row by row from the known values. Considering the property of the triangle where each number (except for those on the base row) is the sum of the two numbers immediately below it, we can determine the numbers on the base row by starting with the known value on each row and working our way up to the base row.

Here's the correct solution that uses this approach:

```python
# Read the input
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    data = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize a list to store the first line of the triangle
first_line = [0] * n
# Start from the known value on the last line
last_pos, last_val = data[-1]
first_line[last_pos - 1] = last_val

# Calculate the base row values using the known values from the triangle
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    pos, val = data[i]
    diff = val - first_line[pos - 1]
    # Distribute the difference evenly to the left and right
    left_diff = diff // 2
    right_diff = diff - left_diff
    
    # Update the base row values based on the difference
    for j in range(pos - 2, -1, -1):
        first_line[j] += left_diff
        left_diff = first_line[j] - left_diff

    for j in range(pos, n - (n - i - 1)):
        first_line[j] += right_diff
        right_diff = first_line[j] - right_diff

# Write the output
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, first_line)))
```

Explanation of the changes and logic:
- Starting with the second to last value (`data[-2]`), we determine the difference that needs to be added to the base row to make the known value (`data[i]`) correct.
- We distribute this difference to the left and right sides of the known value position on the base row.
- We iterate through the base row to the left and right updating the values by adding the difference and adjusting for the new base row value. We are effectively inverting the calculation that would normally be made from the base row up to the known value.
- We repeat this process for each known value, working our way up the triangle.
- Finally, we output the calculated base row as the solution.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's take a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. We are given a piece of information from each row of the triangle, and we know that every number in the triangle (except the bottom row) is the sum of the two numbers directly below it.

2. We need to work our way up from the information given. If we know a value at row `i` and column `j`, we can infer the values of the row above it by considering the difference between the given value and the sum of the values directly below it in the already determined first row.

3. We'll be storing the differences that are needed to reconcile the known value with the sum of the values below it as we go up the triangle.

Let's implement the solution correctly:

```python
# Read the input data
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    known_values = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the base row
base_row = [0] * n

# Compute the values of the base row using the known values from the input
for level in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    pos, value = known_values[level]
    # Calculate the sum of the elements directly below the current level in the base row
    below_sum = sum(base_row[i] for i in range(pos - 1, pos + level - 1))
    # The difference needed to be added to each of the base row elements below the current level
    difference = value - below_sum
    # Distribute the difference equally
    left_diff = difference // 2
    right_diff = difference - left_diff
    # Update the base row values accordingly
    base_row[pos - 2] += left_diff
    base_row[pos - 1] += right_diff

# Now, knowing that the sum of the base row equals the known value at the top of the triangle,
# we can infer the missing first element of the base row
first_row_sum = sum(base_row[1:])  # Sum of the elements from the second to the last
base_row[0] = known_values[0][1] - first_row_sum

# Write the output
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, base_row)))
```

This solution starts from the second-to-last row and works its way up to the first row, adjusting the values of the first row based on the known values. It ensures that the sum of values in the base row matches the known values by distributing differences equally to the left and right. Finally, since we know the sum of all values in the triangle, we can deduce the first value of the base row. This solution should produce the correct output.

I apologize for the confusion in the previous attempts. Let's try a new approach:

Our goal is to fill in all the values from the known values up to the first row. To do this, we need to understand that for each known value on row `i`, it is the sum of a unique set of first-row values. We can use this information to calculate each value in the first row using a system of equations derived from these sums.

Starting with the known value at the bottom row (the `n`-th row), we can determine the first-row values that contribute to it, then move up to the `n-1` row and correct the first-row values using the next known value, and continue this process until we reach the top row.

Let's implement the correct algorithm:

```python
def compute_first_row(knowledge, n):
    # Initialize a list to store the first row
    first_row = [0] * n
    # Initialize the differences from the known value to the sum of the first row entries contributing to it
    row_diff = [0] * (n + 1)
    row_diff[-1] = knowledge[-1][1]  # the known value on the bottom row

    # Calculate the differences for each row
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        pos, val = knowledge[i - 1]
        # Calculate the sum of the first row entries contributing to this known value
        row_sum = sum(first_row[j] for j in range(n - i, n))
        row_diff[n - i] = val - row_sum

    # Calculate the first row using the differences
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        first_row[i - 1] = row_diff[i] - row_diff[i - 1]

    return first_row

# Read the input data from triunghi.in
with open('triunghi.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    knowledge = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Compute the first row
first_row = compute_first_row(knowledge, n)

# Write the output to triunghi.out
with open('triunghi.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, first_row)))
```

This revised solution should properly calculate the first row by building a system of equations based on the known values and the properties of the triangle. We calculate the differences needed to reconcile the sums for each known value, and then we use these differences to determine the individual values in the first row.
