Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# zmeu.py
import numpy as np
import sys

# Redirect standard output to a file
sys.stdout = open('zmeu.out', 'w')

# Read the input data from the file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the DP table with infinities and set the starting point
dp = np.full((p + 1, n + 1), np.inf)
dp[1, n] = 0  # story 1, all heads

# Convert the constraints into a usable form for DP
# Create a list of sets, where each set at index i contains stories that cannot be told after story i
blocked = [set() for _ in range(p + 1)]
for i, j in constraints:
    blocked[i].add(j)

# Dynamic programming to find the minimum total duration
# dp[i][j] will represent the minimum total duration to reach story i with j heads
for i in range(1, p + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if dp[i, j] < np.inf:
            for next_i in range(i + 1, p + 1):
                if next_i not in blocked[i]:
                    duration, lost_heads = stories[next_i - 1]
                    if j - lost_heads >= 0:
                        dp[next_i, j - lost_heads] = min(dp[next_i, j - lost_heads], dp[i, j] + duration)

# Find the minimum duration to reach the last story with at least 1 head
min_duration = min(dp[p, 1:])

# Write the result to the file
if min_duration == np.inf:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(int(min_duration))

# Close the stdout redirection
sys.stdout.close()
```
This script will read from 'zmeu.in', process the data, and write the result to 'zmeu.out'. It uses NumPy for efficient array operations, which is crucial to maintain the memory limit. To avoid memory issues, I am only keeping track of the necessary information in the DP table and initializing with infinity to signify unvisited states. The dynamic programming approach minimizes the total duration while ensuring that the dragon ends with at least one head after all the stories.

The error message indicates that the NumPy module is not installed in the environment where the code is executed, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. For this challenge, we need a solution that doesn't rely on external libraries like NumPy to maintain optimal memory usage.

Given the constraints, we can utilize Python's built-in list and dictionary data structures to solve the problem efficiently without relying on NumPy or any other third-party libraries.

Here is the revised solution that complies with the given constraints:

```python
# zmeu.py

# Initialize the DP dictionary to hold the minimum duration for each (story, head) pair
dp = {(1, n): 0}  # Start with story 1 and all heads

# Create a dictionary to store which stories cannot follow each story
blocked_after = {i: set() for i in range(1, p + 1)}
for i, j in constraints:
    blocked_after[i].add(j)

# Function to perform the DP calculation
def calculate_min_duration():
    for current_story in range(1, p):
        for (story, heads), duration in list(dp.items()):
            if story == current_story:
                for next_story in range(current_story + 1, p + 1):
                    if next_story not in blocked_after[current_story]:
                        next_duration, heads_lost = stories[next_story - 1]
                        remaining_heads = heads - heads_lost
                        if remaining_heads > 0:
                            current_min = dp.get((next_story, remaining_heads), float('inf'))
                            dp[(next_story, remaining_heads)] = min(current_min, duration + next_duration)
    return min([dp[(p, heads)] for heads in range(1, n + 1) if (p, heads) in dp], default=float('inf'))

# Read the input data from the file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Calculate the minimum duration
min_duration = calculate_min_duration()

# Write the result to the file
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_duration == float('inf'):
        file.write(str(-1) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write(str(min_duration) + '\n')
```

This program reads the input from 'zmeu.in', processes the data using dictionary-based dynamic programming, and writes the result to 'zmeu.out'. It avoids using any external libraries to ensure that the memory usage stays within the limits. The use of dictionaries allows us to only keep track of states that we have visited, which is a memory-efficient approach.

The error message indicates that the variable `n` is not defined before it is used to initialize the dictionary `dp`. This is due to an attempt to use `n` before reading the input data from the file where `n` is defined. To fix this, we need to move the initialization of `dp` to occur after we've read `n` from the file. 

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the input data from the file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the DP dictionary after reading the input
dp = {(1, n): 0}  # Start with story 1 and all heads

# Create a dictionary to store which stories cannot follow each story
blocked_after = {i: set() for i in range(1, p + 1)}
for i, j in constraints:
    blocked_after[i].add(j)

# Function to perform the DP calculation
def calculate_min_duration():
    for current_story in range(1, p):
        for (story, heads), duration in list(dp.items()):
            if story == current_story:
                for next_story in range(current_story + 1, p + 1):
                    if next_story not in blocked_after[current_story]:
                        next_duration, heads_lost = stories[next_story - 1]
                        remaining_heads = heads - heads_lost
                        if remaining_heads > 0:
                            current_min = dp.get((next_story, remaining_heads), float('inf'))
                            dp[(next_story, remaining_heads)] = min(current_min, duration + next_duration)
    return min([dp.get((p, heads), float('inf')) for heads in range(1, n + 1)])

# Calculate the minimum duration
min_duration = calculate_min_duration()

# Write the result to the file
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_duration == float('inf'):
        file.write(str(-1) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write(str(min_duration) + '\n')
```

This revised version of the program should now execute correctly, as the initialization of `dp` is now done after the necessary variables have been defined by reading the input file. The result will be written to 'zmeu.out' after the completion of the dynamic programming algorithm.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result suggests a flaw in the dynamic programming logic. After reviewing the logic, I can see that the update for the `dp` dictionary is not correctly preserving the states as it should. Specifically, the condition to filter stories based on `blocked_after` constraints and the loop to iterate over the stories are improperly placed and executed.

The error lies in how the `dp` update is performed. The current implementation iterates over `dp.items()` while also modifying it, which can lead to incorrect behavior. We should instead iterate over a range of possible heads and all the stories to make a correct update.

Here's the corrected solution, which should address the mentioned issues:

```python
# zmeu.py

# Read the input data from the file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the DP list with None and set the starting point
dp = [[None for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n] = 0  # story 1, all heads

# Create a list of sets, where each set at index i contains stories that cannot be told after story i
blocked_after = [set() for _ in range(p + 1)]
for i, j in constraints:
    blocked_after[i].add(j)

# Dynamic programming to find the minimum total duration
# dp[i][j] will represent the minimum total duration to reach story i with j heads
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if dp[i][j] is not None:
            for next_i in range(i + 1, p + 1):
                if next_i not in blocked_after[i]:
                    duration, lost_heads = stories[next_i]
                    if j - lost_heads >= 1:
                        if dp[next_i][j - lost_heads] is None or dp[next_i][j - lost_heads] > dp[i][j] + duration:
                            dp[next_i][j - lost_heads] = dp[i][j] + duration

# Find the minimum duration to reach the last story with at least 1 head
min_duration = min(filter(None, dp[p][1:]))

# Write the result to the file
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_duration is None:
        file.write(str(-1) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write(str(min_duration) + '\n')
```

This revised program now correctly checks for valid story sequences according to the constraints and iterates through all possible head counts to ensure proper state updates. We've used a list of lists for `dp` instead of a dictionary to avoid modifying the structure we are iterating over. The output should now match the expected result for the given input.

The previous solution still contains a mistake concerning the final result. The correct value is not being computed because the final state is not correctly reflecting the minimum duration path, taking into consideration all the constraints and head losses.

The issue might be in the final step, where we are looking to find the minimum duration to reach the last story with at least 1 head remaining. We need to ensure that we are considering all possible paths that result in at least one head remaining at the end and that conform to the constraints given by the blocked_after list.

Let's fix the dynamic programming logic, especially the update of the `dp` structure, and ensure that the constraints are properly enforced:

```python
# Read the input data from the file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the DP table with None and set the starting point
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n] = 0  # story 1, all heads

# Create a list of sets, where each set at index i contains stories that cannot be told after story i
blocked_after = [set() for _ in range(p + 1)]
for i, j in constraints:
    blocked_after[i].add(j)

# Dynamic programming to find the minimum total duration
for i in range(1, p + 1):
    for j in range(n, 0, -1):
        if dp[i][j] != float('inf'):
            for next_i in range(i + 1, p + 1):
                if next_i not in blocked_after[i]:
                    duration, lost_heads = stories[next_i]
                    next_j = j - lost_heads
                    if next_j > 0:
                        dp[next_i][next_j] = min(dp[next_i][next_j], dp[i][j] + duration)

# Find the minimum duration to reach the last story with at least 1 head
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:])

# Write the result to the file
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_duration == float('inf'):
        file.write('-1\n')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_duration}\n')
```

This solution uses a dynamic approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum duration to reach the ith story with j heads remaining. We start with the first story and all heads, and move through the stories without violating the constraints, updating the `dp` table with the minimum durations. The final minimum duration is the smallest value in the last row of the `dp` table, ignoring any `inf` values and considering only cases with at least one head remaining. The result is then written to 'zmeu.out'.

The issue with the previous attempts is that the dynamic programming solution did not correctly enforce the constraints. Specifically, the error is in handling the blocked_after rules, which restrict the order of the stories. Additionally, we need to ensure that we take the minimum duration among all possible head counts that leave at least one head remaining at the end of the sequence, as some paths might not lead to the final story due to the constraints.

Let's re-implement the solution with a revised approach and correct logic:

```python
# Read the input data from the file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [(0, 0)] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the DP table with max durations and set the starting story
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n] = 0  # story 1 with all heads

# Create a dict to store which stories cannot follow each story
blocked_after = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
for a, b in constraints:
    blocked_after[a].append(b)

# Dynamic programming to calculate the minimum total duration
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if dp[i][j] < float('inf'):
            for next_i in range(1, p + 1):
                if next_i not in blocked_after[i]:
                    duration, lost_heads = stories[next_i]
                    if j - lost_heads >= 1:
                        dp[next_i][j - lost_heads] = min(dp[next_i][j - lost_heads], dp[i][j] + duration)

# Find the minimum duration to reach the last story with at least 1 head left
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:])

# Write the result to the file
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    if min_duration == float('inf'):
        file.write('-1\n')
    else:
        file.write(f'{min_duration}\n')
```

The dynamic programming table `dp` keeps track of the minimum duration to reach each story with a certain number of heads. We iterate over each story and update the duration for future stories if they are not blocked by the current one. The minimum duration for the final story with at least one head left is then written to the output file. This solution should now produce the correct output based on the given input data.

I apologize for the confusion in the previous solutions. The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that the dynamic programming logic is still not correctly handling the constraints or updating the states properly. 

To address the issues, we need to ensure that:

1. We initialize the dynamic programming table correctly.
2. We navigate through the stories strictly in increasing order to satisfy the "no backward" constraint.
3. We apply the blocking constraints correctly so that no blocked story follows its blocker.
4. We calculate the correct minimum duration for getting from the first to the last story while respecting the constraints.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations:

```python
# Read the input data from the file
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [None] + [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]  # Index from 1
    constraint_pairs = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the DP table
dp = [[float('inf') for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(p + 1)]
dp[1][n] = 0

# Process constraints
cannot_follow = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
for a, b in constraint_pairs:
    cannot_follow[a].append(b)

# Perform the dynamic programming
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if dp[i][j] < float('inf'):
            duration, heads_lost = stories[i]
            for next_i in range(i + 1, p + 1):
                if next_i not in cannot_follow[i] and j - heads_lost >= 1:
                    dp[next_i][j - heads_lost] = min(dp[next_i][j - heads_lost], dp[i][j] + duration)

# Find the minimum time to tell all stories with at least one head left
min_duration = min(dp[p][1:]) if min(dp[p][1:]) != float('inf') else -1

# Write the result to the file
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{min_duration}\n')
```

This solution strictly follows the order of stories, applies the constraints correctly, and calculates the minimum duration to tell the stories from start to end while maintaining at least one head. The output is then written to 'zmeu.out'. This updated code should now provide the correct answer to the problem.
