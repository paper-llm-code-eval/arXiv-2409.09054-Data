Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read from zmeu.in
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = np.array([list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)], dtype=np.int32)
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize the DP table, where row represents the story and column the remaining heads
dp = np.full((p + 1, n + 1), np.inf, dtype=np.float32)
dp[0, n] = 0  # Starting story has duration 0 and n heads

# Restriction adjacency matrix
restrictions_matrix = np.zeros((p + 1, p + 1), dtype=np.bool8)
for pi, pj in restrictions:
    restrictions_matrix[pi - 1, pj - 1] = True

# Compute the solution with dynamic programming
for i in range(1, p):  # For each story
    for j in range(n + 1):  # For each possible number of heads
        if dp[i - 1, j] != np.inf:
            # If the story is not restricted and we have enough heads,
            # we update the next state in the dp table
            for next_story in range(p):
                if not restrictions_matrix[i - 1, next_story]:
                    remaining_heads = j - stories[i - 1, 1]
                    if remaining_heads >= 0:
                        dp[next_story, remaining_heads] = min(
                            dp[next_story, remaining_heads],
                            dp[i - 1, j] + stories[i - 1, 0]
                        )

# The answer is the minimum duration to get to the last story with any heads left
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1, 1:])
result = int(min_duration) if min_duration != np.inf else -1

# Write to zmeu.out
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

The solution uses dynamic programming to find the shortest path of stories while maintaining at least one head. It reads inputs from `zmeu.in` and writes the output to `zmeu.out`. The solution is optimized to use NumPy arrays, which are efficient for numerical operations, and it maintains the memory usage within the given constraints.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the program must be efficient and you've specified to use highly efficient libraries like `numpy`, I will provide a solution that does not rely on third-party libraries and adheres to the memory constraints.

Here's a revised solution that uses pure Python:

```python
# Define the max values based on the constraints
MAX_P = 200
MAX_N = 500
INF = float('inf')

# Helper function to read input data
def read_data():
    with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

# Helper function to write output data
def write_data(result):
    with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

# Dynamic programming approach to solve the problem
def find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Initialize the DP table
    dp = [[INF] * (MAX_N + 1) for _ in range(MAX_P + 1)]
    dp[0][n] = 0  # Starting story

    # Convert restrictions to a set for fast lookup
    restriction_set = {(pi - 1, pj - 1) for pi, pj in restrictions}

    # Compute the solution
    for i in range(p):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # Only proceed if the current state is reachable
            if dp[i][j] != INF:
                for next_story in range(p):
                    # Check if the next story is not restricted
                    if (i, next_story) not in restriction_set:
                        remaining_heads = j - stories[i][1]
                        if remaining_heads > 0:  # At least one head should remain
                            dp[next_story][remaining_heads] = min(
                                dp[next_story][remaining_heads],
                                dp[i][j] + stories[i][0]
                            )

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story
    min_duration = min(dp[p-1][1:])
    return int(min_duration) if min_duration != INF else -1

# Main logic
def main():
    n, p, k, stories, restrictions = read_data()
    result = find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, restrictions)
    write_data(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution should work within the memory limit and without requiring external libraries. It reads data from `zmeu.in`, processes it using dynamic programming and writes the result to `zmeu.out`. The memory usage is optimized by using a 2D list (instead of a NumPy array) and being cautious about not creating unnecessary large data structures.

After reviewing the code and comparing the expected output with the found output, it appears there was a mistake in the dynamic programming state transition. Specifically, the code is not correctly handling the transition to the next story and not properly considering the sequential order of stories. My previous implementation was incorrectly iterating over all stories for each DP state, rather than considering only the possible next stories based on restrictions.

I will implement a corrected version below:

```python
# Define a large number to represent infinity.
INF = float('inf')

# Helper function to read input data.
def read_data():
    with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

# Helper function to write output data.
def write_data(result):
    with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

# Solve the problem using dynamic programming.
def find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Create an adjacency list to represent restrictions.
    cannot_follow = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
    for pi, pj in restrictions:
        cannot_follow[pi - 1].add(pj - 1)

    # Initialize the DP table.
    # dp[i][j] will be the minimum duration to reach story i with j heads remaining.
    dp = [[INF] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Starting story.

    # Fill in the DP table.
    for i in range(p - 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if dp[i][j] < INF:  # There is a way to reach story i with j heads.
                for next_story in range(i + 1, p):
                    if next_story not in cannot_follow[i]:  # No restriction.
                        remaining_heads = j - stories[next_story][1]
                        if remaining_heads > 0:  # At least one head should remain.
                            dp[next_story][remaining_heads] = min(
                                dp[next_story][remaining_heads],
                                dp[i][j] + stories[next_story][0]
                            )

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story while having at least one head.
    min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])
    return int(min_duration) if min_duration != INF else -1

# Main logic.
def main():
    n, p, k, stories, restrictions = read_data()
    result = find_min_duration(n, p, k, stories, restrictions)
    write_data(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this solution, I am using an adjacency list (`cannot_follow`) to keep track of which stories cannot be followed by another. The dynamic programming table `dp` is filled in such a way that for each story `i`, we only consider the next possible stories `next_story` that are not in the `cannot_follow[i]` set. This makes sure we respect the order of the stories and avoid invalid transitions.

This solution should now give the correct result of `9` for the provided input, as it now properly respects the story order and restrictions.
