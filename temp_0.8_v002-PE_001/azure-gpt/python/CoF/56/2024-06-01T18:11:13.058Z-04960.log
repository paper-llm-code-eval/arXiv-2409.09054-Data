Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

It seems that the running environment does not have the `numpy` library installed, which caused the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Since we have a tight memory constraint and cannot use `numpy`, we'll need to use standard Python data structures and be mindful of memory usage.

Here is the rewritten solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Read input data
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize an adjacency list for the graph representing the restrictions
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(p)]
for pi, pj in restrictions:
    adj_list[pi - 1].append(pj - 1)

# Dynamic programming table (rows are the stories, columns are the remaining heads)
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Starting from story 1

# Populate the dp table
for head in range(n, -1, -1):
    for current_story in range(p):
        if head - stories[current_story][1] >= 0:
            for next_story in range(p):
                if next_story not in adj_list[current_story]:
                    new_head_count = head - stories[current_story][1]
                    if new_head_count >= 0:
                        dp[next_story][new_head_count] = min(
                            dp[next_story][new_head_count],
                            dp[current_story][head] + stories[next_story][0]
                        )

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[-1][1:])

# Output the result
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1))
```

This code uses lists of lists to represent the dynamic programming table and the adjacency list for the restrictions graph. The logic follows the same approach as the `numpy` solution but uses standard Python data types to manage the memory usage effectively.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it seems there's a mistake in the algorithm's logic, particularly in the dynamic programming table population. It incorrectly updates the `dp` table without ensuring that the story transitions are valid according to the remaining heads and the restrictions.

Let's refactor the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Read input data
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize an adjacency list for the graph representing the restrictions
adj_list = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
for pi, pj in restrictions:
    adj_list[pi - 1].add(pj - 1)

# Dynamic programming table (rows are the stories, columns are the remaining heads)
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Starting from story 1

# Populate the dp table
for current_story in range(p - 1):
    for head in range(n + 1):
        if dp[current_story][head] != float('inf'):
            for next_story in range(p):
                if next_story not in adj_list[current_story]:
                    new_head_count = head - stories[next_story][1]
                    if new_head_count >= 0:
                        dp[next_story][new_head_count] = min(
                            dp[next_story][new_head_count],
                            dp[current_story][head] + stories[next_story][0]
                        )

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

# Output the result
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1))
```

This solution updates the dynamic programming table by iterating through all current stories and checking which next stories can be reached without violating the head count and restrictions. The `dp` matrix is updated only if the next story is not one of the restricted sequels and there are enough heads left after the current story.

This should fix the logic error and provide the correct output.

The discrepancy in the results suggests that the dynamic programming (DP) approach is not considering the story restrictions correctly. On re-evaluating the DP state transitions, it becomes apparent that the transitions are not considering the directionality of the restrictions. The DP transition should only occur from a story to another if there is no restriction preventing this.

Here is the fixed solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize an adjacency list for the graph representing the restrictions
# The restriction is from pi to pj, meaning after pi you cannot go to pj
adj_list = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
for pi, pj in restrictions:
    adj_list[pi - 1].add(pj - 1)

# Dynamic programming table
# dp[story][heads] gives the minimum duration to reach story with heads remaining
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Start with the first story

# Populate the dp table
for story in range(1, p):
    for heads in range(n + 1):
        # Find the minimum duration to reach the current story with the current number of heads
        min_duration = float('inf')
        for prev_story in range(story):
            if story not in adj_list[prev_story] and heads + stories[story][1] <= n:
                min_duration = min(min_duration, dp[prev_story][heads + stories[story][1]])
        if min_duration != float('inf'):
            dp[story][heads] = min_duration + stories[story][0]

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[-1][1:])

# Output the result
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1))
```

This solution should correctly apply the restrictions and calculate the minimum duration to reach the last story while maintaining at least one head. It iterates through all possible previous stories for each story and the number of heads, ensuring that transitions comply with the restrictions. The minimum duration is updated only if transitioning to the current story is possible without violating the restrictions and there are enough heads left.

Upon closer examination of the previous code and the problem statement, it is clear that the implemented DP approach still isn't considering the story restrictions properly. Specifically, the algorithm is not handling the constraints that prevent certain stories from being told after others.

The goal is to determine the minimum total duration such that the dragon ends with at least one head after performing a sequence of stories, starting with story 1 and ending with story p. We need to ensure that none of the restrictions are violated when choosing the sequence of stories.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    durations, heads_lost = zip(*[map(int, file.readline().split()) for _ in range(p)])
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize an adjacency list for the graph representing the possible transitions
# If there is a restriction (a, b), you cannot go from a to b.
transitions = [[] for _ in range(p)]
for pre, post in restrictions:
    transitions[pre - 1].append(post - 1)

# Dynamic programming table
# dp[i][j] = minimum duration to reach story i with j heads remaining
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - heads_lost[0]] = durations[0]  # Start from the first story

# Populate the dp table
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        for prev in range(i):
            if i not in transitions[prev] and j + heads_lost[i] <= n:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[prev][j + heads_lost[i]] + durations[i])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story while having at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

# Output the result
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    output = int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1
    file.write(str(output))
```

This revised solution uses an adjacency list to keep track of where you cannot transition to from a given story due to restrictions. The DP table `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum duration to reach story `i` with `j` heads remaining. The algorithm updates this table by considering all stories that can transition to the current story without any restrictions and that would leave a non-negative number of heads. The minimum duration for the last story is then computed, ensuring there's at least one head left. If there's no such sequence, -1 is written to the output file.

The provided solution is still not considering the restrictions correctly. The expectations from the problem statement indicate that the DP solution should carefully handle the order in which stories can be told and the remaining heads after each story.

To fix the solution, we need to re-visit the logic applied for restrictions and make sure it only allows transitions to stories that do not violate any restrictions.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = set(tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k))

# Initialize a list of allowed transitions based on restrictions
allowed_transitions = [[] for _ in range(p)]
for a in range(p):
    for b in range(p):
        if (a + 1, b + 1) not in restrictions:
            allowed_transitions[a].append(b)

# Dynamic programming table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
# Initialize the first story
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

# Populate the dp table
for story in range(1, p):
    for prev_story in allowed_transitions[story]:
        for heads in range(stories[prev_story][1], n + 1):
            if dp[prev_story][heads] != float('inf'):
                new_heads = heads - stories[story][1]
                if new_heads >= 0:
                    dp[story][new_heads] = min(dp[story][new_heads], dp[prev_story][heads] + stories[story][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

# Output the result
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    output = int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1
    file.write(str(output))
```

This solution should correctly enforce the restrictions. It initializes the `allowed_transitions` list by including only the stories that are not directly restricted by any other story. The DP table is then filled by considering these allowed transitions and checking if the resulting number of heads is non-negative after each transition. The minimum total duration to tell all the stories such that the dragon ends with at least one head is then calculated. If no such sequence of stories is possible, then `-1` is written to the output.

The issue with the previous solutions is that they did not correctly account for the story restrictions when populating the dynamic programming table. Additionally, the approach to updating the DP table is flawed, causing incorrect transitions between stories.

To resolve this, we must ensure that we only consider transitions between stories that respect the restriction rules, and each story should only be processed if there are enough heads to survive the story.

Let's attempt a new solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('zmeu.in', 'r') as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Initialize an adjacency list for the graph representing restrictions
# We represent the graph such that graph[a] contains b if b cannot be told after a
graph = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
for a, b in restrictions:
    graph[a - 1].add(b - 1)

# Initialize the DP table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
for heads in range(n - stories[0][1] + 1):
    dp[0][heads] = stories[0][0]

# Populate the DP table
for story in range(1, p):
    for prev_story in range(story):
        if story not in graph[prev_story]:  # Check if the story is not restricted
            for heads in range(n + 1):
                lost_heads = stories[story][1]
                if heads - lost_heads >= 0:
                    dp[story][heads - lost_heads] = min(
                        dp[story][heads - lost_heads],
                        dp[prev_story][heads] + stories[story][0]
                    )

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

# Output the result
with open('zmeu.out', 'w') as file:
    output = int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1
    file.write(str(output))
```

This solution uses a graph to represent the restrictions and populates the DP table only with allowed transitions that do not violate the restrictions. The minimum duration is then calculated for the last story, ensuring at least one head remains. If it is not possible to tell all the stories under these conditions, `-1` is written as output.
