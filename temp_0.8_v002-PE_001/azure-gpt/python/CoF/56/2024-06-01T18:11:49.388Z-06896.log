Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = np.zeros((p, 2), dtype=int)
        for i in range(p):
            stories[i] = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        restrictions = []
        for _ in range(k):
            restrictions.append(tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())))
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Dynamic programming table
    # dp[i][j] will hold the minimum duration to get from story 1 to story i with j heads remaining
    dp = np.full((p + 1, n + 1), np.inf)
    dp[1, n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

    # Adjacency list for restrictions
    adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
    for pre, post in restrictions:
        adj_list[pre].append(post)
    
    # Update DP table
    for i in range(2, p + 1):
        for j in range(n, -1, -1):
            for head_lost in range(stories[i - 1][1] + 1):
                if j + head_lost <= n:
                    min_duration = np.inf
                    for pre in range(1, i):
                        if i not in adj_list[pre] and dp[pre, j + head_lost] != np.inf:
                            min_duration = min(min_duration, dp[pre, j + head_lost] + stories[i - 1][0])
                    dp[i, j] = min(dp[i, j], min_duration)
    
    # The answer will be the minimum of the last row in the DP table for all heads greater than 0
    result = min(dp[p, 1:])
    return result if result != np.inf else -1

def main():
    n, p, k, stories, restrictions = read_input('zmeu.in')
    result = zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions)
    write_output('zmeu.out', result)

main()
```

This Python solution uses numpy to optimize memory usage. The `dp` table is filled with infinity (`np.inf`) to ensure that the default value is not a valid duration. It is then updated according to the constraints.

This is a highly memory-efficient solution as it only uses numpy arrays and basic data structures. The use of numpy in the dynamic programming table (`dp`) is particularly useful because numpy is optimized for operations on large arrays, making it both memory and time-efficient. The algorithm runs in roughly O(p^2 * n) time, which should be efficient enough given the constraints.

Note: This code assumes that the input file `zmeu.in` is in the correct format as per the problem statement.

It appears that the `numpy` library is not available in the execution environment, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. Since the memory limit is quite strict and importing large libraries such as `numpy` might exceed the memory limit, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any external libraries apart from the built-in ones.

Here is an updated version of the solution in pure Python:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Dynamic programming table
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

    # Adjacency list for restrictions
    adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
    for pre, post in restrictions:
        adj_list[pre].append(post)

    # Update DP table
    for i in range(2, p + 1):
        for j in range(n, -1, -1):
            for head_lost in range(stories[i - 1][1] + 1):
                if j + head_lost <= n:
                    min_duration = float('inf')
                    for pre in range(1, i):
                        if i not in adj_list[pre] and dp[pre][j + head_lost] != float('inf'):
                            min_duration = min(min_duration, dp[pre][j + head_lost] + stories[i - 1][0])
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], min_duration)

    # The answer will be the minimum of the last row in the DP table for all heads greater than 0
    result = min(dp[p][1:])
    return int(result) if result != float('inf') else -1

def main():
    n, p, k, stories, restrictions = read_input('zmeu.in')
    result = zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions)
    write_output('zmeu.out', result)

main()
```

This solution uses lists to construct the dynamic programming table and adjacency list. It should work similarly to the previous solution but without the dependency on `numpy`. The use of built-in Python structures should keep the memory usage within the allowed limit.

The difference in the expected and found results suggests a bug in the dynamic programming implementation. The issue might be with how transitions between stories are being handled, especially with regard to the restrictions.

Let's revisit the dynamic programming approach:

1. We track the minimum duration to reach each story with a certain number of heads remaining.
2. We must ensure that when moving from one story to another, we respect the restrictions (i.e., certain stories cannot follow others).
3. When calculating the minimum duration for a story, we should consider all the possible previous stories that do not violate the restrictions.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the implementation of the restrictions check might be incorrect. Let's fix the logic by adjusting how we traverse the restrictions and transition between stories.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = set(tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k))
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Dynamic programming table
    # dp[i][j]: minimum duration to reach story i with j heads remaining
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[1][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

    # Iterate through the stories
    for i in range(2, p + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # Transition from previous stories
            for pre in range(1, i):
                if (pre, i) not in restrictions:
                    for head_lost in range(stories[i - 1][1] + 1):
                        if j - head_lost >= 0:
                            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[pre][j - head_lost] + stories[i - 1][0])

    # The answer will be the minimum of the last story's durations with at least 1 head remaining
    result = min(dp[p][1:])
    return int(result) if result != float('inf') else -1

def main():
    n, p, k, stories, restrictions = read_input('zmeu.in')
    result = zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions)
    write_output('zmeu.out', result)

main()
```

This updated solution changes the inner loop to consider all possible previous stories that don't have a direct restriction with the current story (`if (pre, i) not in restrictions:`). It also corrects the head lost loop to subtract the heads correctly (`if j - head_lost >= 0:`). It's important to ensure that we're considering all the previous stories that can transition to the current one without violating any restrictions. This should give us the correct minimum duration that also ensures the zmeu ends with at least one head remaining.

After reviewing the previous implementation and considering the expected versus the actual output, it's clear there's a mistake in the dynamic programming logic. Specifically, the problem lies in how we're tracking heads and applying the restrictions. The dynamic programming state should consider the number of heads after each step, and we must correctly apply the restriction rules.

Let's correct the dynamic programming logic to address these issues. Here is the revised solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = {i: [] for i in range(1, p + 1)}
        for _ in range(k):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[a].append(b)
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

def zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Initialize the DP table
    # dp[i][j]: minimum duration to reach story i with j heads remaining
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]
    dp[0][n] = 0  # Starting at story 0 with n heads

    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, p + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # For each story, try to reach it from any other story that is not restricted
            for prev in range(0, i):
                if i not in restrictions[prev] and dp[prev][j] != float('inf'):
                    # If there are enough heads left to survive this story
                    if j >= stories[i-1][1]:
                        dp[i][j - stories[i-1][1]] = min(
                            dp[i][j - stories[i-1][1]],
                            dp[prev][j] + stories[i-1][0]
                        )

    # The result is the minimum duration to reach the last story with any number of heads remaining
    result = min(dp[p][1:])  # Exclude the scenario where the Zmeu has 0 heads left
    return int(result) if result != float('inf') else -1

def main():
    n, p, k, stories, restrictions = read_input('zmeu.in')
    result = zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions)
    write_output('zmeu.out', result)

main()
```

The above implementation makes the following corrections:

- Initialize the DP table with the starting point of the zmeu (story 0) with `n` heads and a duration of 0.
- Correctly iterate through all possible previous stories, `prev`, and check if transitioning to the current story `i` is not restricted.
- Ensure that if there are enough heads left after story `i`, update the DP table with the minimum duration.
- Correctly find the result as the minimum duration to reach the last story with at least one head remaining.

This revised logic should calculate the correct minimum duration while respecting all restrictions and ensuring that the zmeu survives with at least one head. The output should now match the expected result for the given input.
