Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

It seems that the environment where the code is being run does not have access to the `numpy` library, which is a non-standard Python library. Given the memory constraints, using `numpy` may not be the best approach anyway. I will rewrite the solution using only built-in Python data structures to ensure compatibility and memory efficiency.

Here is the rewritten solution without using `numpy`:

```python

        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())

        restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

# Function to write the output file
def write_output(filename, min_duration):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(min_duration) + '\n')

# Function to solve the problem
def solve_zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Initialize the dynamic programming table with infinity represented by None
    dp = [[None for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # starting with the first story

    # Apply restrictions
    forbidden_after = [set() for _ in range(p)]
    for i, j in restrictions:
        forbidden_after[i-1].add(j-1)

    # Fill the dynamic programming table
    for story_index in range(1, p):
        for heads_left in range(n+1):
            for prev_story_index in range(story_index):
                if story_index in forbidden_after[prev_story_index]:
                    continue
                duration, heads_cut = stories[story_index]
                if heads_left >= heads_cut and dp[prev_story_index][heads_left] is not None:
                    new_heads_left = heads_left - heads_cut
                    if dp[story_index][new_heads_left] is None or dp[story_index][new_heads_left] > dp[prev_story_index][heads_left] + duration:
                        dp[story_index][new_heads_left] = dp[prev_story_index][heads_left] + duration

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head left
    min_duration = min(filter(lambda x: x is not None, dp[-1][1:]), default=None)
    
    # If the minimum duration is None, no sequence is possible
    return -1 if min_duration is None else min_duration

# Define the main function to orchestrate the problem solving

It seems there was a mistake in the dynamic programming state transitions. The solution attempted to update the DP table using every previous story, but with the restrictions in place, we should only consider those stories that are not restricted by the current one. Additionally, the DP should be initialized with a very large number (as a substitute for infinity) and we should iterate over the heads in reverse to avoid overwriting data that has not yet been processed.

I will rewrite the solution to address these issues.

```python
# Function to read and parse the input file
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return n, p, k, stories, restrictions

# Function to write the output file
def write_output(filename, min_duration):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(min_duration) + '\n')

# Function to solve the problem
def solve_zmeu(n, p, k, stories, restrictions):
    # Initialize the dynamic programming table with a very large number (substitute for infinity)
    dp = [[float('inf') for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # starting with the first story

    # Apply restrictions
    next_possible = [[] for _ in range(p)]
    for prev_story, next_story in reversed(restrictions):
        next_possible[prev_story-1].append(next_story-1)

    # Fill the dynamic programming table
    for story_index in range(p-1):
        for next_story_index in next_possible[story_index] or range(story_index+1, p):
            duration, heads_cut = stories[next_story_index]
            for heads_left in range(n, heads_cut - 1, -1):
                if dp[story_index][heads_left] != float('inf'):
                    new_heads_left = heads_left - heads_cut
                    dp[next_story_index][new_heads_left] = min(
                        dp[next_story_index][new_heads_left],
                        dp[story_index][heads_left] + duration
                    )

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head left

My previous solution has an issue regarding the handling of the restrictions. I incorrectly processed restrictions in reverse, and I did not properly account for the 'no restriction' case where a story can be followed by any other story. We should be checking each pair of stories and updating the DP table only if there's no restriction that forbids that sequence.

Let's correct the logic to ensure that we only consider valid transitions between stories, and we start with the first story and end with the last story while minimizing the total duration.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to read and parse the input file
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
        restrictions = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
        for _ in range(k):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            restrictions[a - 1].add(b - 1)
    return n, p, stories, restrictions

# Function to write the output file
def write_output(filename, min_duration):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(min_duration) + '\n')

# Function to solve the problem
def solve_zmeu(n, p, stories, restrictions):
    # Initialize the dynamic programming table
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Initialize the first story

    # Dynamic programming to calculate minimum duration
    for i in range(p - 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if dp[i][j] < float('inf'):
                for next_story in range(i + 1, p):
                    # Check if the transition is allowed
                    if next_story in restrictions[i]:
                        continue
                    new_heads = j - stories[next_story][1]
                    if new_heads >= 0:
                        dp[next_story][new_heads] = min(
                            dp[next_story][new_heads],
                            dp[i][j] + stories[next_story][0]
                        )

    # The answer is the minimum duration that ends with the last story, with at least one head remaining
    min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

    return -1 if min_duration == float('inf') else min_duration

# Define the main function to orchestrate the problem solving
def main():
    # Read input
    n, p, stories, restrictions = read_input('zmeu.in')

    # Solve the problem
    min_duration = solve_zmeu(n, p, stories, restrictions)

    # Write output
    write_output('zmeu.out', min_duration)

# Call the main function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This updated solution now properly initializes the dynamic programming table, respects the restrictions by only considering valid story sequences, and correctly calculates the minimum duration. It should give the expected result when executed.
