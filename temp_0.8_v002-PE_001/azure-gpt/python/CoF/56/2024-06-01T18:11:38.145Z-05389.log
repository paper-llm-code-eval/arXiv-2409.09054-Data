Un zmeu cu $n$ capete călătoreşte din poveste în poveste, iar în poveştile tradiţionale întâlneşte câte un Făt Frumos care-l mai scurtează de câteva capete, în timp ce în poveştile moderne salvează omenirea mâncând în timp record, cu toate capetele lui, insecte ucigaşe apărute prin mutaţii genetice. Într-o seară, el îşi planifică o succesiune de poveşti cărora să le dea viaţă. El ştie $p$ poveşti numerotate de la $1$ la $p$, durata fiecăreia şi numărul de capete pe care le pierde în fiecare poveste. Mai ştie o mulţime de $k$ perechi de poveşti, semnificând faptul că a doua poveste din pereche nu poate fi spusă după prima poveste din pereche.

# Cerinţă
Ştiind că trebuie să înceapă cu povestea $1$ şi să încheie succesiunea cu povestea $p$, ajutaţi bietul zmeu să aleagă una sau mai multe poveşti intermediare astfel încât durata totală să fie minimă şi să rămână cu cel puţin un cap la sfârşitul tuturor poveştilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `zmeu.in` conţine pe prima linie numerele $n, p$ şi $k$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu. Pe fiecare din următoarele $p$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $d_i$ şi $c_i$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce reprezintă durata şi numărul de capete tăiate pentru fiecare poveste. Iar pe ultimele $k$ linii se află câte o pereche de numere $p_i$ şi $p_j$ (separate prin câte un spaţiu) ce semnifică faptul că povestea $p_j$ nu poate fi spusă după povestea $p_i$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `zmeu.out` conţine o singură linie pe care se află un număr natural reprezentând durata (minimă) a succesiunii de poveşti sau valoarea $–1$ dacă nu există o astfel de succesiune.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $2 ≤ N ≤ 500$
* $1 ≤ P ≤ 200$
* $1 ≤ k ≤ 30 \ 000$
* Valorile reprezentând duratele şi numărul de capete sunt numere naturale (duratele fiind strict pozitive), nedepăşind valoarea $10$.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Solution for Zmeu problem
import numpy as np

# Read input from file
with open("zmeu.in") as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]

# Create an adjacency matrix for the constraints
constraint_matrix = np.zeros((p, p), dtype=np.bool_)

for i, j in constraints:
    constraint_matrix[i-1][j-1] = True

# Dynamic programming to find the minimum duration
# Initialize DP array where dp[i][j] is the min duration for story i with j heads remaining
dp = np.full((p, n+1), np.inf)
dp[0][n-stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

# Fill DP table
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n+1):
        for prev in range(i):
            # Ensure no constraint is violated and there are enough heads
            if not constraint_matrix[prev][i] and j+stories[i][1] <= n:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[prev][j+stories[i][1]] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p-1][1:])

# Write output to file
with open("zmeu.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != np.inf else -1) + "\n")
```

The provided solution implements a dynamic programming approach with a constraint graph represented by an adjacency matrix and a DP table for storing the minimum duration for each story with a specific number of heads remaining. It reads from 'zmeu.in' and writes the result to 'zmeu.out'. The solution avoids using excessive memory and adheres to the memory limit constraints. It also avoids using `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations.

It appears that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the challenge specifies that the solution must optimize both time and memory usage and suggests using numpy and other highly efficient libraries, it's clear that the environment should support numpy. However, to adhere to the requirement and solve the problem within the given constraints, we will need to refactor the code to not use numpy or any other third-party libraries. Here is the rewritten solution:

```python
# Solution for Zmeu problem without using numpy

# Read input from file
with open("zmeu.in") as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Create a constraint list for each story
constraint_list = [[] for _ in range(p)]
for i, j in constraints:
    constraint_list[i - 1].append(j - 1)

# Initialize DP array where dp[i][j] is the min duration for story i with j heads remaining
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

# Fill DP table
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        for prev in range(i):
            # Ensure no constraint is violated and there are enough heads
            if i not in constraint_list[prev] and j + stories[i][1] <= n:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[prev][j + stories[i][1]] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

# Write output to file
with open("zmeu.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1) + "\n")
```

This solution should work within the constraints of memory, not require any external libraries, and solve the given problem efficiently. It uses a list of lists to create the DP table and a list of constraints for each story to represent the constraint graph.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result suggests that there is a bug in the dynamic programming logic of the previous solution. The issue likely lies in the way the DP table is updated based on the constraints and the number of heads remaining after each story. Let's go through the logic and fix the issue.

Upon review, I noticed that the DP update condition is incorrect. It is not checking if there are enough remaining heads before transitioning to the next story. The condition `j + stories[i][1] <= n` should be changed to `j - stories[i][1] >= 0` to reflect that we are looking at remaining heads after the story, not before.

Let's address this issue and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Solution for Zmeu problem without using numpy

# Function to solve the problem
def solve(n, p, k, stories, constraints):
    # Create a constraint list for each story
    constraint_list = [[] for _ in range(p)]
    for i, j in constraints:
        constraint_list[j - 1].append(i - 1)

    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
    # Base case: starting the journey with story 1
    dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, p):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # Check if the story can be told with the current number of heads
            if j - stories[i][1] >= 0:
                for prev in range(i):
                    # Ensure no constraint is violated
                    if prev not in constraint_list[i] and dp[prev][j] != float('inf'):
                        dp[i][j - stories[i][1]] = min(dp[i][j - stories[i][1]], dp[prev][j] + stories[i][0])

    # Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
    min_duration = min(dp[p-1][1:])

    # Return the minimum duration
    return int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1

# Read input from file
with open("zmeu.in") as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Solve the problem
min_duration = solve(n, p, k, stories, constraints)

# Write output to file
with open("zmeu.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(min_duration) + "\n")
```

This solution should now correctly solve the problem by adhering to the constraints and properly updating the DP table. It takes into account the constraints by building a list of stories that cannot follow each story and updates the DP table based on the number of heads remaining after each story is told. The result is then written to the output file.

The results still differ because the updated dynamic programming logic is not correctly handling the transitions between stories and their constraints. The issue seems to be that the solution is not properly considering all possible paths through the stories that satisfy both the constraints and the requirement to end with at least one head.

To fix this, let's ensure we are considering the correct order of the stories and correctly maintaining the number of heads after each story. We should iterate through the heads in reverse to prevent overwriting possible states that haven't been calculated yet.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Solution for Zmeu problem without using numpy

# Read input from file
with open("zmeu.in") as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Create a constraint list for each story
constraint_list = [set() for _ in range(p)]
for i, j in constraints:
    constraint_list[j - 1].add(i - 1)

# Initialize DP table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Start story with initial heads

# Fill DP table
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n, -1, -1):  # Iterate through heads in reverse
        for prev in range(i):
            # Ensure no constraint is violated and there are enough heads
            if prev not in constraint_list[i] and j >= stories[i][1]:
                dp[i][j - stories[i][1]] = min(dp[i][j - stories[i][1]], dp[prev][j] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

# Write output to file
with open("zmeu.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1) + "\n")
```

This solution should now correctly consider all possible story paths and head combinations, ensuring that we find the minimum total duration of stories while ending with at least one head. The DP logic has been fixed to update the states for each number of heads from high to low within the inner loop, which prevents premature overwriting of states. The results should now match the expected output.

Upon re-evaluating the logic, I realized that the DP update process has an issue where it does not properly propagate the number of heads through the stories. To fix the solution, we need to modify the DP update process so that for each story and each possible number of remaining heads, we look at all possible previous stories that could lead to that state without violating constraints.

We should iterate over the possible number of heads in reverse when updating the DP table to avoid overwriting the states that are yet to be considered. Additionally, we need to ensure that we use the correct number of heads after finishing a story, not before starting it.

Let's correct the logic and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Solution for Zmeu problem without using numpy

# Read input from file
with open("zmeu.in") as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Create adjacency list for the constraints, storing which stories cannot follow each story
constraint_list = [set() for _ in range(p)]
for before, after in constraints:
    constraint_list[before - 1].add(after - 1)

# Initialize DP table
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]

# Fill DP table
for i in range(1, p):
    for prev in range(i):
        # Ensure no constraint is violated between prev and current story
        if i not in constraint_list[prev]:
            for heads in range(n, stories[i][1] - 1, -1):
                # Check if there are enough heads left to tell the story
                if dp[prev][heads] != float('inf'):
                    dp[i][heads - stories[i][1]] = min(dp[i][heads - stories[i][1]], dp[prev][heads] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[-1][1:])

# Write output to file
with open("zmeu.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1) + "\n")
```

This corrected solution should now properly handle the constraints and the propagation of the number of heads through the stories, giving the correct minimum total duration for the story sequence ending with at least one head. The result should now match the expected output.

The issue persists because the approach to handling constraints and transitions might not be accounting for stories that could follow other stories. The key mistake in the previous attempts is not considering that when evaluating a story, we need to look at all possible heads that could remain after that story, which means we should look at all previous states that could transition into our current state.

To correct this, we need to make sure that when we're at story i and we have j heads left, we look at all previous stories and check if we can transition from those stories to i without violating any constraints and while having enough heads. We also need to account for the heads lost when moving to the next story.

Let's revise the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Solution for Zmeu problem without using numpy

# Read input from file
with open("zmeu.in") as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    stories = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Create a constraint adjacency list for each story
constraint_adj = [set() for _ in range(p)]
for a, b in constraints:
    constraint_adj[b - 1].add(a - 1)

# Initialize DP table, with dp[i][j] representing the minimum duration to reach story i with j heads
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - stories[0][1]] = stories[0][0]  # Starting story

# Iterate through stories in order
for i in range(1, p):
    # Iterate through the number of heads
    for j in range(n + 1):
        # Iterate through previous stories
        for prev in range(i):
            # Check for no constraints and enough heads after prev story
            if prev not in constraint_adj[i] and j >= stories[prev][1]:
                # Update dp table if we can reach story i with less duration
                dp[i][j - stories[i][1]] = min(dp[i][j - stories[i][1]], dp[prev][j] + stories[i][0])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head
min_duration = min(dp[-1][1:])

# Write output to file
with open("zmeu.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(-1 if min_duration == float('inf') else int(min_duration)) + "\n")
```

This solution should now correctly propagate the available number of heads and account for constraints, ensuring that the minimum total duration of stories is found while ending with at least one head. The DP logic has been corrected to properly handle story transitions and constraints. The result should now match the expected output.

Let's re-evaluate the dynamic programming logic and constraints processing. The previous solutions did not correctly implement the transitions between stories, and the constraints were not handled properly. To fix the problem, we must ensure that each story we consider can be reached from any previous story without violating the constraints and that we have enough heads to proceed. Additionally, we need to properly update the DP table based on these considerations.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Solution for Zmeu problem without using numpy

# Read input from file
with open("zmeu.in") as file:
    n, p, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    durations, heads_lost = [], []
    for _ in range(p):
        duration, heads = map(int, file.readline().split())
        durations.append(duration)
        heads_lost.append(heads)
    constraints = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Process constraints into a dict of prohibited following stories
cannot_follow = {i: set() for i in range(p)}
for i, j in constraints:
    cannot_follow[i - 1].add(j - 1)

# Initialize DP array where dp[i][j] is the min duration for story i with j heads remaining
dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(p)]
dp[0][n - heads_lost[0]] = durations[0]  # Base case, starting from the first story

# Fill DP table
for i in range(1, p):
    for j in range(n + 1):
        # Continue only if we have enough heads to tell this story
        if j >= heads_lost[i]:
            for prev in range(i):
                # Check if story prev can be followed by story i without violating constraints
                if i not in cannot_follow[prev]:
                    # If it's possible, update the DP table
                    dp[i][j - heads_lost[i]] = min(dp[i][j - heads_lost[i]], dp[prev][j] + durations[i])

# Find the minimum duration for the last story with at least one head remaining
min_duration = min(dp[p - 1][1:])

# Write output to file
with open("zmeu.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(int(min_duration) if min_duration != float('inf') else -1) + "\n")
```

The key changes in this solution are processing the constraints into a dict of prohibited following stories, then updating the DP table by considering only valid transitions from previous stories that can be followed by the current story without violating the constraints, and having enough heads after telling the story. The result should now match the expected output, providing the correct minimum total duration for the story sequence ending with at least one head.
