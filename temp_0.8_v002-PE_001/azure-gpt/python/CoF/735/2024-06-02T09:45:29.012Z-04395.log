Mircea este pasionat de programare. El a început să rezolve probleme din ce în ce mai grele. Astfel a ajuns la o problemă, care are ca date de intrare un tablou pătratic cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane, componente tabloului fiind toate numerele naturale distincte de la $1$ la $n^2$. Pentru a verifica programul pe care l-a scris îi trebuie un fişier care să conţină tabloul respectiv. După ce a creat acest fişier, fratele său, pus pe şotii îi umblă în fişier şi îi schimbă câteva numere consecutive, cu numărul $0$. Când se întoarce Mircea de la joacă constată cu stupoare că nu îi merge programul pentru testul respectiv. După câteva ore de depanare îşi dă seama că programul lui este corect şi că fişierul de intrare are probleme.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să-l ajute pe Mircea, găsindu-i cel mai mic şi cel mai mare dintre numerele consecutive schimbate de fratele său.

# Date de intrare
În fişierul `numere.in` se dă pe prima linie $n$, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii elementele tabloului, câte $n$ elemente pe o linie, separate între ele prin câte un spaţiu, după modificările făcute de fratele lui Mircea.

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `numere.out` se va scrie pe un singur rând cu un singur spaţiu între ele numerele cerute (primul fiind cel mai mic).

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $0 < n \leq 500$
- Fratele lui Mircea schimbă cel puţin un număr în fişier.
- Numerele schimbate de fratele lui Mircea sunt mai mici sau cel mult egale cu $60\ 000$.

Example:
`numere.in`
```
3
5 0 7
0 0 1
6 9 8
```

`numere.out`
```

```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input matrix
with open('numere.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    matrix = np.array([list(map(int, f.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)], dtype=np.int32)

# Find the indices of the zeros in the matrix
zero_indices = np.where(matrix == 0)

# Extract the unique row and column indices where zeros are found
unique_rows = np.unique(zero_indices[0])
unique_cols = np.unique(zero_indices[1])

# Determine the bounding box of the zeros (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
min_row, max_row = unique_rows.min(), unique_rows.max()
min_col, max_col = unique_cols.min(), unique_cols.max()

# Flatten the matrix and sort
flat_matrix = np.sort(matrix.ravel())

# Find the largest number before the first zero and the smallest number after the last zero
min_changed_num = flat_matrix[np.where(flat_matrix == 0)[0][-1] + 1]
max_changed_num = flat_matrix[np.where(flat_matrix == 0)[0][0] - 1]

# Write the output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{min_changed_num} {max_changed_num}\n")
```

- The matrix is stored as a NumPy array, which is efficient both in terms of memory and computational performance.
- The dtype 'np.int32' is used to represent the numbers because it is sufficient to store values up to 60,000 and it saves memory compared to the default 'np.int64'.
- The algorithm searches for the zeros and then calculates the smallest and largest changed numbers by using the properties of the sorted flattened matrix. This avoids the need for any complex iteration or additional storage.
- The output is written to a file using 'with' statements to ensure that the file is properly closed after writing.

Please note that while this solution is expected to be memory-efficient, the actual memory usage will also depend on the implementation of the numpy library and the Python interpreter itself. The exact memory footprint cannot be guaranteed to be under ~8MB without knowing the specific versions and configurations of the libraries and the environment it runs in.

The provided error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment. Since the challenge requires optimization for both time and memory and mentions the use of "numpy and other highly efficient libraries," it's likely that the environment where the solution is being tested does not have the `numpy` library installed.

In order to proceed with a solution that adheres to the memory constraints and does not rely on `numpy`, we will need to use Python's built-in functionalities. Here's the updated solution using standard Python lists and functions:

```python
# Initialize the necessary variables.
min_changed_num = float('inf')  # Set to positive infinity initially.
max_changed_num = -1  # Set to negative value initially.
current_num = 0
zero_found = False

# Read the input matrix and process it line by line.
with open('numere.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    for _ in range(n):
        row = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))
        for num in row:
            if num == 0:
                zero_found = True
                if current_num < min_changed_num and current_num != 0:
                    min_changed_num = current_num
            else:
                # When a non-zero is found after a zero, it could be the max_changed_num.
                if zero_found and (num < min_changed_num or max_changed_num == -1):
                    max_changed_num = num
                zero_found = False
            current_num = num

# In case the zero was at the end, we need to set max_changed_num to the last number.
if zero_found:
    max_changed_num = current_num

# Write the output.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{min_changed_num} {max_changed_num}\n")
```

This updated solution does not use `numpy` and should fall within the required memory constraints, as it only uses built-in data structures and works with one line of the input at a time. The algorithm keeps track of the current number being read and updates the minimum and maximum changed numbers accordingly. As soon as a zero is encountered, it flags that a change was found, and as soon as a non-zero number is found after a zero, it updates the maximum changed number if needed. The minimum changed number is updated only if it's less than the current minimum and is not zero. The solution writes the results to the output file as specified in the problem statement.

The found output differs from the expected output because the algorithm incorrectly determined the minimum and maximum numbers that were replaced by zeros. The original code attempted to update these numbers as it encountered zeros and non-zeros, but it failed to handle the case where multiple zeros are together, and did not correctly identify the sequence of replaced numbers.

The correct approach to fix this is to identify the sequence of consecutive zeros and then find the smallest and largest numbers that used to be before and after this sequence in the original matrix, which contains all numbers from $1$ to $n^2$ in natural order.

Let's rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
# Read the input matrix.
with open('numere.in', 'r') as f:
    n = int(f.readline())
    nums = [int(num) for row in range(n) for num in f.readline().split()]

# Create a list of all numbers that should be in the matrix.
expected_nums = set(range(1, n**2 + 1))

# Identify missing numbers (which were replaced by zeros).
missing_nums = expected_nums - set(nums)

# Find the smallest and largest numbers in the missing set.
min_changed_num = min(missing_nums)
max_changed_num = max(missing_nums)

# Write the output.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"{min_changed_num} {max_changed_num}\n")
```

This solution does the following:

1. Reads the entire matrix into a flat list `nums`.
2. Constructs a set `expected_nums` of all numbers that should be in the matrix.
3. Creates a set `missing_nums` by subtracting the set of read numbers from the expected numbers.
4. Finds the smallest and largest numbers in the `missing_nums` set.
5. Writes these two numbers to the output file.

This approach should provide the correct output and also stay within the memory limit, since it uses sets, which are efficient in Python, and only creates a flat list of numbers instead of a 2D list, which would take up more space.
