Mircea este pasionat de programare. El a început să rezolve probleme din ce în ce mai grele. Astfel a ajuns la o problemă, care are ca date de intrare un tablou pătratic cu $n$ linii şi $n$ coloane, componente tabloului fiind toate numerele naturale distincte de la $1$ la $n^2$. Pentru a verifica programul pe care l-a scris îi trebuie un fişier care să conţină tabloul respectiv. După ce a creat acest fişier, fratele său, pus pe şotii îi umblă în fişier şi îi schimbă câteva numere consecutive, cu numărul $0$. Când se întoarce Mircea de la joacă constată cu stupoare că nu îi merge programul pentru testul respectiv. După câteva ore de depanare îşi dă seama că programul lui este corect şi că fişierul de intrare are probleme.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să-l ajute pe Mircea, găsindu-i cel mai mic şi cel mai mare dintre numerele consecutive schimbate de fratele său.

# Date de intrare
În fişierul `numere.in` se dă pe prima linie $n$, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii elementele tabloului, câte $n$ elemente pe o linie, separate între ele prin câte un spaţiu, după modificările făcute de fratele lui Mircea.

# Date de ieşire
În fişierul `numere.out` se va scrie pe un singur rând cu un singur spaţiu între ele numerele cerute (primul fiind cel mai mic).

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $0 < n \leq 500$
- Fratele lui Mircea schimbă cel puţin un număr în fişier.
- Numerele schimbate de fratele lui Mircea sunt mai mici sau cel mult egale cu $60\ 000$.

Example:
`numere.in`
```
3
5 0 7
0 0 1
6 9 8
```

`numere.out`

This solution takes advantage of numpy's efficient array handling, but it's important to note that numpy arrays are typically much larger than native Python lists due to additional information stored in the numpy array header. Therefore, the usage of numpy is kept minimal and only used to read the matrix from the input file. If the input file is quite large, using the traditional file reading method and processing line by line would have been a more memory-efficient approach, however, given the constraints and the memory limit, the numpy approach should suffice. The solution assumes that there is only one sequence of zeros and finds the numbers just before and after this sequence. If there could be multiple sequences of zeros, the algorithm would have to be adapted to keep track of all such sequences and find the minimal starting and maximal ending points considering all of them.

# Efficient function to find the sequence of 0's and their surrounding numbers
def find_consecutive_zeros(matrix):
    # Flatten the matrix to work with a 1D array
    flat_matrix = matrix.flatten()
    # Identify where the zeros start and end

    largest_changed = flat_matrix[last_zero_index + 1] - 1 if last_zero_index < len(flat_matrix) - 1 else len(flat_matrix)

    return smallest_changed, largest_changed

# Read the input data from the file

# Write the output data to the file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{smallest_changed} {largest_changed}\n')
```

This Python code reads from `numere.in`, processes the matrix to find the smallest and largest consecutive numbers changed to 0, and writes the results to `numere.out`. It makes use of the `numpy` library to handle the matrix efficiently, but only uses it to store and process the matrix, not for reading or writing the input/output files to adhere to the problem constraints.

The error you're encountering indicates that the `numpy` package is not installed in the environment where the program is being run. However, the problem statement requires using memory-efficient methods and suggests using highly efficient libraries. 

Given that `numpy` might not be available and considering the memory constraints, I'll provide a solution using standard Python lists instead of `numpy` arrays for handling the matrix. This approach should still be memory-efficient, as long as we're careful with the space we allocate. Here's a full solution without `numpy`:

```python
# Function to find the smallest and largest number in the sequence of zeros
def find_zero_sequence(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    found_zero = False
    smallest = largest = None

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                if not found_zero:
                    found_zero = True
                    # If it's the first zero, calculate the previous number (check edge cases)
                    smallest = matrix[i][j-1] if j > 0 else (matrix[i-1][-1] if i > 0 else 1)
                # If it's the last zero, calculate the next number (check edge cases)
                if j == n - 1 or matrix[i][j+1] != 0:
                    largest = matrix[i][j+1] if j < n - 1 else (matrix[i+1][0] if i < n - 1 else n*n)
                    return smallest, largest
            else:
                found_zero = False

# Read the input data
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the smallest and largest numbers in the sequence of zeros
smallest_changed, largest_changed = find_zero_sequence(matrix)

# Write the output data
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{smallest_changed+1} {largest_changed-1}\n")
```

In this solution, we're reading the input file line by line and converting each line to a list of integers, which we then append to our `matrix`. The function `find_zero_sequence` operates similarly to before but uses standard list indexing instead of `numpy`. After finding the sequence of zeros and their surrounding numbers, we write the results to `numere.out`. This approach should be memory-efficient for the given constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is due to incorrect logic in the function `find_zero_sequence`. The current logic does not account for the possibility of zeros spanning multiple rows. When it encounters a zero, it only checks the immediate previous and next numbers in the matrix, without considering the continuation of zeros across rows.

We need to adjust the function to correctly identify the smallest and largest numbers surrounding the consecutive zeros, which may span across multiple rows. To do this, we can iterate through the matrix and keep track of the starting and ending indices of the sequence of zeros.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the smallest and largest number in the sequence of zeros
def find_zero_sequence(matrix, n):
    # Flatten the matrix into a list for easier processing
    flat_matrix = [item for row in matrix for item in row]
    # Indices where zeros start and end
    zero_start = zero_end = None

    for i in range(n*n):
        if flat_matrix[i] == 0:
            zero_end = i  # Update the end index whenever a zero is found
            if zero_start is None:
                zero_start = i  # Set the start index when the first zero is found
        elif zero_end is not None:
            # Found the end of a sequence of zeros
            break

    # Compute the numbers before and after the zeros
    smallest_changed = flat_matrix[zero_start - 1] if zero_start > 0 else 1
    largest_changed = flat_matrix[zero_end + 1] if zero_end < n*n - 1 else n*n

    return smallest_changed, largest_changed

# Read the input data
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the smallest and largest numbers in the sequence of zeros
smallest_changed, largest_changed = find_zero_sequence(matrix, n)

# Write the output data
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{smallest_changed+1} {largest_changed-1}\n")
```

In this updated solution, the matrix is flattened into a single list to make it easier to work with. The function `find_zero_sequence` looks for the start and end indices of the sequence of zeros within the flattened list and correctly calculates the smallest and largest changed numbers by considering the entire sequence of zeros, regardless of how it spans across rows. The results are then written to `numere.out`.

The previous solutions incorrectly calculated the smallest and largest changed numbers. The main issue was that they didn't properly handle the case where zeros span across multiple rows or are located at the start or end of a row. To address this, we need to scan the entire matrix, keeping track of all non-zero numbers, and then find the missing numbers by comparing with the expected range of numbers from 1 to n^2.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to find the smallest and largest number in the sequence of zeros
def find_zero_sequence(matrix, n):
    # Create a set of all numbers from 1 to n^2
    all_numbers = set(range(1, n*n + 1))
    # Remove all non-zero numbers from the set, leaving only the missing numbers
    for row in matrix:
        all_numbers -= set(filter(lambda x: x != 0, row))

    # Convert the set to a sorted list to find the smallest and largest missing numbers
    missing_numbers = sorted(list(all_numbers))
    smallest_changed = missing_numbers[0]
    largest_changed = missing_numbers[-1]

    return smallest_changed, largest_changed

# Read the input data
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Find the smallest and largest numbers in the sequence of zeros
smallest_changed, largest_changed = find_zero_sequence(matrix, n)

# Write the output data
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{smallest_changed} {largest_changed}\n")
```

This solution constructs a set of all expected numbers and removes the numbers that appear in the matrix (excluding zeros). The remaining numbers in the set are the missing ones, which were replaced by zeros. By sorting this set, we can identify the smallest and largest missing numbers, which correspond to the smallest and largest consecutive numbers changed to zero. Finally, the solution writes these numbers to `numere.out`.
