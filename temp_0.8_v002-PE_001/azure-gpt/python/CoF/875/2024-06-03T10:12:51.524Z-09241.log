În *Orașul Liniștit* un număr de $k$ tineri prieteni doresc să participe la un miting de protest. Deoarece cartierul în care locuiesc aceștia este mare, ei se vor deplasa spre punctul de întâlnire cu mașinile personale. Fiecare tânăr va aduce cu el o pancartă, pe care a desenat o singură literă din mulțimea $\{$`A`$,$ `B`$,\ \dots,$ `Z`$\}$. Nu există două pancarte cu litere identice. Cele $k$ litere formează un cuvânt, să-l notăm $cuv$, cunoscut.

Cartierul în care locuiesc tinerii poate fi codificat printr-o matrice cu $n \cdot m$ zone pătratice, dintre care unele sunt interzise. Se știe că o mașină consumă o unitate de combustibil la trecerea dintr-o zonă în zona vecină și nu consumă combustibil dacă staționează. Două zone sunt vecine dacă au în comun o latură. Pentru a face economie de combustibil, tinerii decid că dacă două mașini se întâlnesc într-o zonă și toate literele aflate în cele două mașini reprezintă o secvență din cuvântul $cuv$, atunci ei vor continua drumul cu o singură mașină, luând desigur toate pancartele cu ei. În caz contrar, mașinile își continuă drumul separat.

De exemplu, dacă cuvantul $cuv$ este `JOS`, atunci mașina care transportă litera `J` poate prelua tânărul care aduce pancarta cu litera `O`, sau invers: mașina având litera `O` poate prelua tânărul care aduce litera `J`. Apoi se poate continua drumul spre mașina care transportă litera `S`. În altă variantă se pot reuni  mai întâi literele `S` și `O` într-o singură mașină, dacă mașinile care le transportau se întâlnesc în aceeași zonă. Totuși, între mașina care transportă doar litera `J` și cea care transportă doar litera `S` nu se poate realiza un transfer, adică o reunire a literelor.

# Cerinţe

Cunoscând dimensiunile cartierului $n$ și $m$, cuvântul $cuv$, configurația cartierului și pozițiile inițiale ale tinerilor, se cere:

1. Aria minimă a unei submatrice a matricei care codifică cartierul, în care se situează toate pozițiile inițiale ale tinerilor. 
2. Numărul minim de unități de combustibil consumați de către toate mașinile, știind că în final toți tinerii se vor reuni într-o singură mașină.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `miting.in` conţine:

Pe prima linie, un număr natural $p$, care poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau $2$.

Pe a doua linie două numere naturale $n$ și $m$, separate printr-un spațiu.

Pe a treia linie, cuvântul $cuv$.

Pe următoarele $n$ linii, câte $m$ caractere pe linie reprezentând zonele cartierului. O zonă este interzisă dacă îi corespunde caracterul `#`, este liberă dacă îi corespunde caracterul `_` (underline) și este punctul de plecare al unei mașini dacă îi corespunde una dintre literele cuvântului $cuv$.


# Date de ieșire


Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $1$, **se va rezolva numai cerința $1$**.  

În acest caz, în fişierul de ieşire `miting.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural $A$, reprezentând aria minimă a unei submatrice a matricei care codifică cartierul, în care se situează toate pozițiile inițiale ale tinerilor. 

Dacă valoarea lui $p$ este $2$, **se va rezolva numai cerința $2$**.  

În acest caz, în fişierul de ieşire `miting.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural $C$, reprezentând numărul minim de unități de combustibil consumate de către toate mașinile până la reunirea tinerilor, deci și a literelor, într-o singură mașină. În cazul în care nu există soluție, adică nu toți tinerii se pot reuni într-o singură mașină, se va scrie $-1$.  


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq n, m \leq 60$
* $2 \leq k \leq 10$
* Fie $z$ numărul zonelor interzise. Atunci $0 ≤ z ≤ \frac{n \cdot m}{3}$.
* În fiecare unitate de timp, o mașină poate să rămână pe loc în așteptarea alteia sau poate să treacă într-o zonă vecină, indiferent dacă zona respectivă este sau nu ocupată de o altă mașină.
* Lungimea laturii unei zone se consideră egală cu $1$.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a primei cerinţe se acordă $20$ de puncte, iar pentru cerința a doua se acordă $80$ de puncte.
* Pentru $30\%$ dintre testele cerinței $2$ se garantează $k ≤ 3$.

        for d in directions:
            new_pos = (pos[0] + d[0], pos[1] + d[1])
            if 0 <= new_pos[0] < n and 0 <= new_pos[1] < m and grid[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] != '#':
                new_letters = letters | {grid[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]]} if grid[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] in cuv else letters
                if new_pos not in visited or new_letters != visited[new_pos]:

# Depending on the value of p, solve the corresponding problem

```

The above code defines two separate functions for each requirement of the problem: `find_bounding_box` calculates the minimal area of a submatrix in which all the starting positions of the youngsters are located (requirement 1), and `calculate_fuel` computes the minimal amount of fuel consumed by all cars until all youngsters, and thus all letters, gather into a single car (requirement 2). The solution is optimized for both time and memory usage, considering the given constraints.

The error indicates that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the problem statement mentions optimizing for memory and does not explicitly require `numpy`, and given the memory constraints, we can proceed without using `numpy`. We can achieve the required functionality using Python's standard libraries.

I'll rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other external libraries.

```python

    fuel = calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m)
    with open('miting.out', 'w') as f:

This solution addresses the issue by removing the dependency on `numpy` and sticking to standard Python libraries. The program should now work without any import-related errors and within the mentioned memory limits.

After reviewing the logic of the `calculate_fuel` function, it seems that the function may not be correctly accounting for the optimal path that the cars should take to combine their respective letters into the word `cuv`. The function is intended to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path that allows all cars to merge letters into the word `cuv`, minimizing the total fuel spent. However, it incorrectly updates the visited positions with individual letters rather than taking into account the set of letters that each car has collected. Therefore, the BFS may not be properly considering all possible combinations of letters from different paths.

Let's reimplement the `calculate_fuel` function by fixing the logic. We'll use a BFS that tracks each car's position and the set of letters it has collected. In each step, we'll check if by moving to a neighboring position, we can form a subsequence of the target word `cuv`. If it's possible, we merge the letters and continue the search from the new position.

We will also need to modify the way we keep track of visited states. Since we need to consider both the position and the set of letters a car has, the visited states will now be a dictionary where the key is the position and the value is a set of frozensets representing different combinations of letters that have been at this position.

Here is the rewritten solution:

```python
from collections import deque

# Function to find the bounding box for the starting positions
def find_bounding_box(grid, cuv):
    positions = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv]
    top = min(pos[0] for pos in positions)
    bottom = max(pos[0] for pos in positions)
    left = min(pos[1] for pos in positions)
    right = max(pos[1] for pos in positions)
    return (bottom - top + 1) * (right - left + 1)

# Function to calculate fuel consumption using BFS
def calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m):
    start_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv]
    queue = deque([(pos, set(grid[pos[0]][pos[1]]), 0) for pos in start_positions])
    visited = {pos: set([frozenset(grid[pos[0]][pos[1]])]) for pos in start_positions}
    cuv_set = set(cuv)

    while queue:
        pos, letters, fuel = queue.popleft()
        if letters == cuv_set:
            return fuel

        for d in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            new_i, new_j = pos[0] + d[0], pos[1] + d[1]
            if 0 <= new_i < n and 0 <= new_j < m and grid[new_i][new_j] != '#':
                new_letters = letters | {grid[new_i][new_j]} if grid[new_i][new_j] in cuv_set else letters
                new_letters_frozen = frozenset(new_letters)
                if new_letters_frozen not in visited.get((new_i, new_j), set()):
                    if (new_i, new_j) in visited:
                        visited[(new_i, new_j)].add(new_letters_frozen)
                    else:
                        visited[(new_i, new_j)] = {new_letters_frozen}
                    queue.append(((new_i, new_j), new_letters, fuel + 1))
    return -1

# Read the input from 'miting.in'
with open('miting.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    cuv = file.readline().strip()
    grid = [list(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

# Depending on the value of p, solve the corresponding problem
if p == 1:
    # Solving for problem 1
    area = find_bounding_box(grid, cuv)
    with open('miting.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{area}\n")
else:
    # Solving for problem 2
    fuel = calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m)
    with open('miting.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{fuel}\n")
```

This code fixes the BFS logic for tracking collected letters and properly updates the visited states. By using a set of frozensets to store the combinations of letters that have visited each position, we can correctly identify new states and avoid revisiting the same state with the same letter combinations. This should now yield the expected result.

Upon examining the provided code and the discrepancy in results, it is clear that there is an oversight in the BFS implementation. The algorithm does not correctly handle the merging of cars carrying subsequences of the target word `cuv`. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility that two cars might pass each other without merging because the letters they carry do not form a consecutive subsequence of `cuv` at that moment, but could do so if they were to meet in a future move after collecting additional letters.

The BFS needs to be modified to not only consider the current set of letters each car has but also the order in which they are collected, to ensure that cars only merge when they form a valid consecutive subsequence of `cuv`. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the merging of cars is an irreversible action — once cars merge, they should continue as a single car with the combined set of letters.

To fix the issue, the `calculate_fuel` function will be rewritten to correctly handle the merging of cars based on valid subsequences of `cuv`. We will use a BFS that keeps track of the positions of cars and the sequence of letters they have collected so far.

Here is the updated solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_bounding_box(positions):
    min_x = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    max_x = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    min_y = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    max_y = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    return (max_x - min_x + 1) * (max_y - min_y + 1)

def calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m, start_positions):
    # Define all four possible movements
    movements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # Initialize the BFS queue and visited states
    queue = deque()
    visited = {}
    for x, y in start_positions:
        queue.append(((x, y), grid[x][y], 0))
        visited[((x, y), grid[x][y])] = 0

    # Perform BFS
    while queue:
        (x, y), subseq, fuel = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if the current subsequence is the target word
        if subseq == cuv:
            return fuel
        
        # Explore all possible movements
        for dx, dy in movements:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            # Check if the next position is within bounds and not blocked
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                # Check if adding this letter continues a proper subsequence
                if grid[nx][ny] in cuv:
                    next_subseq = subseq + grid[nx][ny] if subseq + grid[nx][ny] in cuv else subseq
                else:
                    next_subseq = subseq
                
                # Check if this state has not been visited or is a shorter path to an existing state
                if ((nx, ny), next_subseq) not in visited or visited[((nx, ny), next_subseq)] > fuel + 1:
                    visited[((nx, ny), next_subseq)] = fuel + 1
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), next_subseq, fuel + 1))
    
    # If we exit the loop, it means it's not possible to form the target word
    return -1

# Read input from 'miting.in'
with open('miting.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    cuv = file.readline().strip()
    grid = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Identify starting positions for each letter in 'cuv'
start_positions = {(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv}
    
# Depending on 'p', solve the corresponding problem
if p == 1:
    # Solving for problem 1
    area = find_bounding_box(start_positions)
elif p == 2:
    # Solving for problem 2
    area = calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m, start_positions)

# Write output to 'miting.out'
with open('miting.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{area}\n")
```

In this revised solution, the `calculate_fuel` function now correctly handles sequences of letters and ensures that merging happens only when letters form a consecutive subsequence of the target word `cuv`. This implementation should produce the correct output for the given problem.

The issue lies in the merging logic of cars within the `calculate_fuel` function. The previous implementation attempted to track subsequences of `cuv`, but it did not correctly handle the cases where multiple cars can merge at different times and form the word `cuv`. The merging should only occur if the cars can form a contiguous subsequence of `cuv` in the correct order.

To address this, we need to change the approach. Instead of tracking subsequences, we'll maintain a state that keeps track of the cars along with the letters they have. We need to ensure that we are only merging cars that have letters that are next to each other in the word `cuv`, and the merging must happen in the correct order.

Here's a reworked solution that addresses these issues:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input data from 'miting.in'
with open('miting.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    cuv = file.readline().strip()
    grid = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Helper function to find the bounding box for the starting positions
def find_bounding_box(positions):
    min_i = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    max_i = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    min_j = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    max_j = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    return (max_i - min_i + 1) * (max_j - min_j + 1)

# Helper function to check if a given sequence of letters is a valid subsequence of 'cuv'
def is_valid_subsequence(subseq, cuv):
    iter_cuv = iter(cuv)
    return all(letter in iter_cuv for letter in subseq)

# Function to calculate fuel consumption using BFS
def calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m):
    # Define possible movements
    movements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # Start positions and initial states
    starts = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv]

This updated solution recalculates the fuel consumption with a more accurate BFS implementation that checks for valid subsequences of `cuv` when cars merge, ensuring they are in the correct order. It checks for a valid subsequence each time letters are collected. This should produce the correct output and meet the expected result.

The issue may be that the logic of the BFS does not correctly account for the merging of cars in an optimal way. The algorithm needs to consider all possible mergers effectively and not advance the sequence unless it's a valid continuation of `cuv`. Let's address the problem step by step:

1. We need to track the state of each car, including its position and the collected letters.
2. We need to track all possible groupings of cars, as they can merge in different configurations.
3. We should avoid redundant sequences that do not lead to the formation of the word `cuv`.

Let's attempt a new approach: We'll use BFS to explore all possible moves of cars, but we'll track the current state in terms of which letters of the word `cuv` have been collected, rather than the sequence of letters. We will treat each set of collected letters as a bitmask, where each bit represents whether a letter has been collected or not.

Here is the rewritten solution:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input data from 'miting.in'
with open('miting.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    cuv = file.readline().strip()
    grid = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Function to find the bounding box for the starting positions
def find_bounding_box(positions):
    min_i = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    max_i = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    min_j = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    max_j = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    return (max_i - min_i + 1) * (max_j - min_j + 1)

# Function to calculate fuel consumption using BFS
def calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m):
    # Initial states {position: bitmask}
    initial_states = {
        (i, j): 1 << cuv.index(grid[i][j])
        for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv
    }
    # All letters collected bitmask
    all_collected = (1 << len(cuv)) - 1

    # BFS queue contains tuples of (position, bitmask, fuel)
    queue = deque([(pos, mask, 0) for pos, mask in initial_states.items()])
    # Visited states to avoid repeated work
    visited = {pos: mask for pos, mask in initial_states.items()}

    # Perform BFS
    while queue:
        position, bitmask, fuel = queue.popleft()

        # If all letters have been collected, return the fuel spent
        if bitmask == all_collected:
            return fuel

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = position[0] + dx, position[1] + dy

            # Check if the next position is valid and within grid bounds
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                new_bitmask = bitmask
                if grid[nx][ny] in cuv:
                    letter_index = cuv.index(grid[nx][ny])
                    # Set the bit corresponding to the letter
                    new_bitmask |= 1 << letter_index

                # Proceed only if this state has not been visited or found a better fuel cost
                if new_bitmask not in visited.get((nx, ny), {}) or fuel + 1 < visited[(nx, ny)][new_bitmask]:
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), new_bitmask, fuel + 1))
                    visited.setdefault((nx, ny), {})[new_bitmask] = fuel + 1

    # Return -1 if it is not possible to gather all letters
    return -1

# Depending on 'p', solve the corresponding problem
if p == 1:
    # Finding the bounding box of starting positions
    starting_positions = {(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv}
    result = find_bounding_box(starting_positions)
else:
    # Calculating the minimum fuel required
    result = calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m)

# Write the output to 'miting.out'
with open('miting.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This code should now keep track of the cars' states using a bitmask representing the letters collected for `cuv`. As we use BFS to find the shortest path that collects all letters, we ensure that we are merging cars in a way that builds `cuv` correctly. This solution should correctly calculate the minimum amount of fuel required.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` where it is expected that `visited.get((nx, ny), {})` would return a dictionary, but it's actually returning an `int`. This means we are not consistently storing the visited states. The visited dictionary should map positions to another dictionary containing bitmasks and fuel values rather than directly mapping to an integer.

Let's correct this by ensuring that `visited` is a dictionary where each key is a position `(i, j)` and the value is another dictionary with keys being the bitmask and values being the fuel cost. We'll fix the logic for maintaining and checking visited states in the code below:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read the input data from 'miting.in'
with open('miting.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    cuv = file.readline().strip()
    grid = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Function to find the bounding box for the starting positions
def find_bounding_box(positions):
    min_i = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    max_i = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    min_j = min(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    max_j = max(positions, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
    return (max_i - min_i + 1) * (max_j - min_j + 1)

# Function to calculate fuel consumption using BFS
def calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m):
    # Initial states {position: bitmask}
    initial_states = {
        (i, j): 1 << cuv.index(grid[i][j])
        for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv
    }
    # All letters collected bitmask
    all_collected = (1 << len(cuv)) - 1

    # BFS queue contains tuples of (position, bitmask, fuel)
    queue = deque([(pos, mask, 0) for pos, mask in initial_states.items()])
    # Visited states to avoid repeated work
    visited = {pos: {mask: 0} for pos, mask in initial_states.items()}

    # Perform BFS
    while queue:
        position, bitmask, fuel = queue.popleft()

        # If all letters have been collected, return the fuel spent
        if bitmask == all_collected:
            return fuel

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = position[0] + dx, position[1] + dy

            # Check if the next position is valid and within grid bounds
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                new_bitmask = bitmask
                if grid[nx][ny] in cuv:
                    letter_index = cuv.index(grid[nx][ny])
                    # Set the bit corresponding to the letter
                    new_bitmask |= 1 << letter_index

                # Check if this state has not been visited or has a better fuel cost
                if nx not in visited or ny not in visited[nx] or new_bitmask not in visited[nx][ny] or fuel + 1 < visited[nx][ny][new_bitmask]:
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), new_bitmask, fuel + 1))
                    visited.setdefault(nx, {}).setdefault(ny, {})[new_bitmask] = fuel + 1

    # Return -1 if it is not possible to gather all letters
    return -1

# Depending on 'p', solve the corresponding problem
if p == 1:
    # Finding the bounding box of starting positions
    starting_positions = {(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[i][j] in cuv}
    result = find_bounding_box(starting_positions)
else:
    # Calculating the minimum fuel required
    result = calculate_fuel(grid, cuv, n, m)

# Write the output to 'miting.out'
with open('miting.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This change ensures that the `visited` dictionary correctly supports multiple bitmasks per position, avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred previously. Now, the BFS should correctly track and update states with their fuel costs and find the minimum fuel required to collect all letters.
