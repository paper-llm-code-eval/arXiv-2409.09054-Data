Ilinca este o fetiţă căreia îi place foarte mult să deseneze; ea a făcut multe desene pe care le-a numerotat de la $1$ la $d$ şi apoi le-a multiplicat (toate copiile poartă acelaşi număr ca şi originalul după care au fost făcute). În vacanţă s-a hotărât să-şi deschidă propria expoziţie pe gardul bunicilor care are mai multe scânduri; pe fiecare scândură ea aşează o planşă (un desen original sau o copie). Ilinca ţine foarte mult la desenele ei şi doreşte ca fiecare desen să apară de cel puţin $k$ ori (folosind originalul şi copiile acestuia). Ilinca se întreabă în câte moduri ar putea aranja expoziţia. Două moduri de aranjare sunt considerate distincte dacă diferă cel puţin prin numărul unei planşe (de exemplu: $2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 3$ este aceeaşi expoziţie ca şi $2 \ 3 \ 1 \ 3$, dar este diferită de $2 \ 1 \ 3 \ 1$ şi de $1 \ 3 \ 3 \ 1$).

# Cerinţă

Cunoscând $n$ numărul de scânduri din gard, $d$ numărul desenelor originale şi $k$ numărul minim de apariţii al fiecărui desen, să se determine în câte moduri poate fi aranjată expoziţia, ştiind că Ilinca are la dispoziţie oricâte copii doreşte.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `expozitie.in` va conţine $3$ numere, $n \ d \ k$ - numărul de scânduri, numărul desenelor originale, respectiv numărul minim de aparţii.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `expozitie.out` va conţine un singur număr, $nr$, numărul modurilor distincte de aranjare a expoziţiei.


# Restricții și precizări

* $n,k,d$ sunt numere naturale
* $1 \leq n \leq 500$
* $1 \leq d \leq 500$
* $0 \leq k \leq n$

Certainly, here is the corrected solution, which reads from `expozitie.in` and writes to `expozitie.out` without using `input()` or `print()`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants for modulo operations
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to compute binomial coefficients using Pascal's triangle
def compute_binomials(n, k, mod):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    binom = np.ones((n + 1, k + 1), dtype=np.int64)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            binom[i, j] = (binom[i - 1, j - 1] + binom[i - 1, j]) % mod
    return binom[n, k]

# Read the data from the input file
with open('expozitie.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, d, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Compute the ways to arrange the exhibition
ways = 0
for i in range(d + 1):
    comb = compute_binomials(d, i, MOD)
    free_places = n - i * k
    if free_places >= 0:
        ways = (ways + comb * compute_binomials(free_places + d - 1, d - 1, MOD)) % MOD

# Write the result to the output file
with open('expozitie.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(ways))
```

This Python code does not use `input()` or `print()`. Instead, it reads from the file `expozitie.in` and writes the output to the file `expozitie.out`. It calculates the number of ways Ilinca can arrange her exhibition using a dynamic programming approach to compute the binomial coefficients and an iteration that applies the stars and bars combinatorial method, considering the minimum number of appearances per drawing. The modulo operation ensures that the numbers stay within the memory constraints.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. This might be due to not having `numpy` installed in the environment where the code is running.

Given the memory constraints and the module availability issue, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy`. I will use lists to store binomial coefficients and implement an iterative approach to calculate them, which should be memory efficient for the problem constraints.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Constants for modulo operations
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to compute binomial coefficients iteratively
def compute_binomial_coefficients(n, k):
    C = [0 for _ in range(k+1)]
    C[0] = 1  # nC0 is 1

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        # Compute next row of pascal triangle using
        # the previous row
        j = min(i, k)
        while j > 0:
            C[j] = (C[j] + C[j-1]) % MOD
            j -= 1

    return C[k]

# Read the data from the input file
with open('expozitie.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, d, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Compute the ways to arrange the exhibition
ways = 0
for i in range(d + 1):
    comb = compute_binomial_coefficients(d, i)
    free_places = n - i * k
    if free_places >= 0:
        ways = (ways + comb * compute_binomial_coefficients(free_places + d - 1, d - 1)) % MOD

# Write the result to the output file
with open('expozitie.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(ways))
```

This implementation uses a simple list-based approach to calculate the binomial coefficients and should not exceed the memory limit. It reads from `expozitie.in` and writes to `expozitie.out`, as required.

The difference in expected and found result indicates there's a logical error in the previous implementation. The error seems to arise from not correctly applying the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the number of distinct arrangements of the exhibition. We are supposed to subtract the cases where there are too many repetitions of the same drawing, but the previous implementation just adds the number of combinations without considering the cases that need to be excluded.

Let's correct the logic to properly apply the inclusion-exclusion principle and calculate the number of ways Ilinca can arrange her exhibition. We'll also use a more memory-efficient approach for computing the binomial coefficients.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to compute binomial coefficients using dynamic programming
def binomial(n, k):
    if k > n - k:
        k = n - k
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result = result * (n - i) // (i + 1)
    return result

# Function to compute number of ways based on inclusion-exclusion principle
def compute_ways(n, d, k):
    ways = 0
    sign = 1

    for i in range(d + 1):
        # Number of ways to choose i drawings that will have more than k copies
        choose_more_than_k = binomial(d, i)
        # Number of ways to arrange the remaining places after selecting i drawings
        arrange_remaining = binomial(n - k * i + d - 1, d - 1)
        ways += sign * choose_more_than_k * arrange_remaining
        ways %= MOD
        sign *= -1  # Alternating signs for inclusion-exclusion

    return ways

# Read the data from the input file
with open('expozitie.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, d, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Compute the ways to arrange the exhibition
ways = compute_ways(n, d, k)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('expozitie.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(ways))
```

This version does not use `numpy` and uses an iterative approach to calculate binomial coefficients, which should be more memory efficient. It also correctly applies the inclusion-exclusion principle by alternating the addition and subtraction of cases to find the number of distinct arrangements. The program should now provide the correct result of 2 when given the input `3 2 1`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there's an arithmetic error in the code. Specifically, the way I've computed the binomial coefficients is not correct. The binomial function should handle large numbers and perform modulo operations to avoid integer overflow, which can occur with large n and k values when computing `n choose k` directly.

The corrected binomial function should use an iterative approach to calculate `C(n, k) % MOD`, using the property that `C(n, k) = C(n, k-1) * (n-k+1) / k`. We also need to calculate the result under the modulo operation to avoid overflow.

Let's rewrite the binomial function and the solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to compute the modular inverse of a number under modulo MOD
def mod_inv(a, mod):
    return pow(a, mod-2, mod)

# Function to compute binomial coefficients under modulo MOD
def binomial(n, k, mod):
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    num = denom = 1
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        num = (num * (n - i + 1)) % mod
        denom = (denom * i) % mod
    return (num * mod_inv(denom, mod)) % mod

# Function to compute number of ways based on inclusion-exclusion principle
def compute_ways(n, d, k):
    ways = 0
    sign = 1

    for i in range(d + 1):
        # Calculate the number of ways to choose i drawings to exclude
        ways_to_exclude = binomial(d, i, MOD)
        # Calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining boards
        remaining_drawings = n - i * k
        if remaining_drawings >= 0:
            ways_to_distribute = binomial(remaining_drawings + d - 1, d - 1, MOD)
            ways = (ways + sign * ways_to_exclude * ways_to_distribute) % MOD
        sign *= -1  # Alternate the sign for inclusion-exclusion

    return ways

# Read the data from the input file
with open('expozitie.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, d, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Compute the ways to arrange the exhibition
ways = compute_ways(n, d, k)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('expozitie.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(ways))
```

This corrected solution now correctly calculates binomial coefficients modulo `10**9 + 7`, accounting for potential integer overflow. Furthermore, it correctly applies the inclusion-exclusion principle, ensuring that we correctly count the number of distinct arrangements possible. It should now output the expected result of `2` for the input `3 2 1`.

I apologize for the oversight. There seems to be a logical flaw in the way the inclusion-exclusion principle was applied in the previous solutions. Given the restriction that each drawing must appear at least `k` times, we should not be considering drawings to exclude but rather ensuring each drawing appears the required number of times.

The correct approach would not subtract cases but rather calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining `n - d*k` boards after placing `k` copies of each drawing. This is a classic problem of distributing indistinguishable objects (remaining boards) into distinguishable bins (drawings, including the originals).

Here is the corrected algorithm and solution:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Dynamic programming approach to calculate binomial coefficients
def binomial(n, k, mod):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    C = [[0 for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(min(i, k)+1):
            if j == 0 or j == i:
                C[i][j] = 1
            else:
                C[i][j] = (C[i-1][j-1] + C[i-1][j]) % mod
    return C[n][k]

# Function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the exhibition
def compute_ways(n, d, k):
    # Ensure there are enough boards to meet the minimum requirement for each drawing
    if n < d * k:
        return 0
    # Calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining boards
    remaining_boards = n - d * k
    # This is equivalent to placing `remaining_boards` indistinguishable items into `d` distinguishable bins
    return binomial(remaining_boards + d - 1, remaining_boards, MOD)

# Read input data
with open('expozitie.in', 'r') as infile:
    n, d, k = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Compute the number of ways to arrange the exhibition
ways = compute_ways(n, d, k)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('expozitie.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(ways))
```

This solution correctly computes the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `remaining_boards` from `remaining_boards + d - 1` options (considering the 'bars' in the "stars and bars" combinatorial method). It should now return the correct output of `2` for the input `3 2 1`.
