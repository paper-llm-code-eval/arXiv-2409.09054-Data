Here is a programming challenge.
Please solve this problem efficiently, optimizing both time and memory usage.
Create the most efficient solution for this challenge in python. Utilize numpy and other highly efficient libraries whenever possible.
This problem has a memory limit of ~8MB so please be sensitive on using memory. Using too much memory may result in OOM.
The code must compile and be correct.
The solution must read from `siruri.in` and write to `siruri.out`.
The solution must not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

The solution must be written in a markdown code block.

Se consideră un vector unidimensional $x$ cu $n$ componente numere naturale distincte, cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să construiască vectorul $y$ cu elemente din mulțimea $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ astfel încât oricare ar fi numerele naturale $i, j$ cu proprietatea că $1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq j \leq n$ și $x_i < x_j$ să avem $y_i < y_j$.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `siruri.in` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul $n$
* pe linia a doua componentele vectorului $x$ separate prin câte un spațiu

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `siruri.out` va conține pe prima linie componentele vectorului $y$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100$;
* Componentele vectorului x sunt numere naturale cel mult egale cu $32 \ 000$.

Example:
`siruri.in`
```
6
12 3 7 16 10 1
```

`siruri.out`
```
5 2 3 6 4 1
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read data from siruri.in
with open("siruri.in", "r") as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    x = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Create a copy of x and sort it to find the rank of each element in the sorted array
sorted_x = np.array(x).argsort().argsort() + 1

# Write the result to siruri.out
with open("siruri.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted_x.tolist())) + '\n')
```

Please note:

- `argsort()` is called twice to get the rank positions.
- The index starts from 0 in Python, so 1 is added to match the given constraints (start from 1).
- The memory usage should stay within the limit since no heavy data structures are used.
- The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting algorithm, which should be acceptable for n <= 100.

It seems that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment. Since the challenge requires optimizing both time and memory and considering the memory limit, let's implement a solution without using `numpy` or any other external libraries. We can achieve the task by using pure Python.

Here's an updated solution using only built-in libraries:

```python
# Read data from siruri.in
with open("siruri.in", "r") as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    x = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Associate each number in x with its index
indexed_x = list(enumerate(x, start=1))

# Sort by the value of x to determine the order
indexed_x.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])

# Construct the y vector by assigning ranks based on the sorted order
y = [0] * n
for rank, (original_index, _) in enumerate(indexed_x, start=1):
    y[original_index - 1] = rank

# Write the result to siruri.out
with open("siruri.out", "w") as file:
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, y)) + '\n')
```

This solution should satisfy the memory and time limits as it only uses built-in data structures and functions. The sorting operation is the most time-consuming part, but since `n` is limited to 100, the sorting should not be a problem for the time complexity.
