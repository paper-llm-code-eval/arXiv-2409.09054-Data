Un gospodar are $N$ iepuri (pe care i-a numerotat de la $1$ la $N$) şi foarte mulţi morcovi. Ce e mai deosebit în această gospodărie este că iepurii sunt organizaţi ierarhic, în funcţie de vârstă, autoritate şi nevoile nutriţionale. Astfel, fiecare iepure are exact un şef direct (exceptându-l pe Rilă Iepurilă, care este şeful cel mare, şeful tuturor iepurilor). Orice iepure poate avea 0, 1 sau mai mulţi subordonaţi direcţi. Orice iepure-şef va mânca cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre subordonaţii săi direcţi.

Gospodarul nu se poate hotărî câţi morcovi să dea fiecărui iepure şi ar vrea să ştie în câte moduri poate împărţi morcovi la iepuri ştiind că fiecare iepure poate să mănânce minim un morcov şi maxim $K$ morcovi.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care calculează numărul de posibilităţi modulo $30 \ 011$ de a împărţi morcovi la cei $N$ iepuri ştiind că orice iepure poate mânca între $1$ şi $K$ morcovi şi trebuie să mănânce cu cel puţin un morcov mai puţin decât fiecare dintre iepurii care îi sunt subordonaţi direcţi. 

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `iepuri.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie două numere naturale $N$ şi $K$, separate printr-un spaţiu, reprezentând numărul de iepuri, respectiv numărul maxim de morcovi ce pot fi mâncaţi de un iepure.
- pe fiecare din următoarele $N-1$ linii se află câte două numere naturale distincte $a$ şi $b$, cuprinse între $1$ şi $N$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia că iepurele $a$ este şeful direct al iepurelui $b$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul  de ieşiere `iepuri.out` va conţine numărul de moduri de a împărţi morcovii conform condiţiilor specificate în enunţ, modulo $30 \ 011$.

# Restricţii şi precizări
* $1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100$
* Numărul ce trebuie scris în fişierul de ieşire va fi afişat modulo $30 \ 011$.

The previous code attempted to use `numpy`, which is not available in the given environment. Therefore, we need to reimplement the solution without `numpy` or any other third-party libraries that are not included in the standard Python distribution. Here's the updated solution:

```python
MOD = 30011

def dfs(u, adjacency_list, dp, k):
    children = adjacency_list[u]
    dp[u][0] = 1
    for child in children:
        dfs(child, adjacency_list, dp, k)
        temp = [0] * (k + 1)
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                temp[i] = (temp[i] + dp[u][i] * dp[child][j]) % MOD
        dp[u] = temp

def main():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            adjacency_list[a].append(b)

    dp = [[0 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    dfs(1, adjacency_list, dp, k)

    answer = sum(dp[1]) % MOD

    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(answer))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This solution uses lists instead of numpy arrays to store the dynamic programming state. Since lists are part of the Python standard library, this should resolve the import issue we encountered earlier. The rest of the logic remains the same, using depth-first search (DFS) to compute the number of ways to distribute carrots based on the hierarchy of the rabbits.

The issue here seems to be with the dynamic programming (DP) recursive approach. The calculation of the `temp` array needs to be done by considering all previously computed combinations of carrots for the parent and each child. There's also a possible issue with the base case for leaves not being handled correctly. The DP should be set to 1 for all possible carrot counts for leaves since they have no subordinates.

Let's correct the DFS function and ensure the initialization for the DP is handled correctly, particularly for the leaf nodes:

```python
MOD = 30011

def dfs(u, adjacency_list, dp, k):
    is_leaf = True
    children = adjacency_list[u]
    dp[u] = [1] * (k + 1)
    for child in children:
        dfs(child, adjacency_list, dp, k)
        is_leaf = False
        temp = [0] * (k + 1)
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                temp[i] = (temp[i] + dp[u][i] * dp[child][j]) % MOD
        dp[u] = temp
    if is_leaf:
        dp[u] = [1] + [0] * k  # Only one way for a leaf node: 1 carrot

def main():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        # Rila Iepurila is assumed to be 1 and has no parent
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            adjacency_list[a].append(b)

    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    dfs(1, adjacency_list, dp, k)

    answer = sum(dp[1][1:]) % MOD  # Exclude the 0 carrot case for root

    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(answer))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the updated code, I've modified the DFS function to correctly initialize the `dp[u]` list with 1 for all carrot counts when u is a leaf node. This reflects the fact that a leaf node can have any number of carrots (from 1 to k), each in exactly one way.

For non-leaf nodes, the `dp[u]` list is updated using a temporary `temp` list that aggregates the number of ways to distribute carrots, considering all possible distributions of carrots to the children.

Finally, when summing up `dp[1]` to get the answer, we start from index 1 (excluding the 0 carrot case for root) because Rila Iepurila must have at least one carrot.

It seems my previous solution contained a bug in the way I was computing the dynamic programming table. It seems I misunderstood how the DP table needs to be updated. For each node, we need to consider all possible distributions of carrots to its children before updating the number of ways for that node. Moreover, the way of iterating over the possible number of carrots for the children and the parent might be incorrect.

Let's fix the recursive function to correctly calculate the number of ways to distribute the carrots, ensuring that each child gets strictly fewer carrots than its parent:

```python
MOD = 30011

def dfs(node, graph, dp, K):
    if not graph[node]:  # If leaf node
        dp[node] = [1] * (K + 1)
        return dp[node]

    # Initialize DP for the current node
    dp[node] = [0] * (K + 1)
    dp[node][0] = 1  # Base case: 0 ways for 0 carrots

    # Iterate over each child and update the DP for the current node
    for child in graph[node]:
        child_ways = dfs(child, graph, dp, K)
        new_dp_node = [0] * (K + 1)
        # Update the DP array for the current node with the information from the child
        for carrots_parent in range(K, 0, -1):
            for carrots_child in range(carrots_parent):
                new_dp_node[carrots_parent] += dp[node][carrots_parent] * child_ways[carrots_child]
                new_dp_node[carrots_parent] %= MOD
        dp[node] = new_dp_node

    return dp[node]

def main():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        n, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            graph[a].append(b)

    dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    dfs(1, graph, dp, K)

    # Sum all the ways to give carrots to Rilă Iepurilă (node 1), from 1 to K carrots
    total_ways = sum(dp[1][1:]) % MOD  # Skip the 0 carrot count

    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(total_ways))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this revised version, when we visit a node, we initialize its DP array with `0` ways for each possible number of carrots and set the base case for `0` carrots to `1`. Then, for each child, we iterate over the number of carrots that the parent can get and the number of carrots that the child can get, ensuring the child gets fewer carrots than the parent. After considering all children, we should have the correct number of ways to distribute carrots for the current node, which we then return.

This version should work correctly and respect the memory constraints, as we're only using Python lists and simple recursion. Let's run this code to see if it produces the expected output.

The previous code still contains a logical error in the way the dynamic programming table is updated. Instead of multiplying the current count of ways for the parent node by the number of ways for the child node, we need to multiply the temporary array by the number of ways for the child for each possible count of carrots for the parent node.

Let's fix the DFS function to correctly compute the number of ways to distribute carrots, taking into account the constraint that each child must get fewer carrots than its parent.

Here is the revised solution that should correctly solve the problem:

```python
MOD = 30011

def dfs(node, graph, dp, K):
    # If leaf node, it can have 1 to K carrots in 1 way each
    if not graph[node]:
        dp[node] = [1] * (K + 1)
        return

    # Initialize DP for the current node to 1 way to distribute 0 carrots
    dp[node] = [1] + [0] * K

    # Iterate over each child
    for child in graph[node]:
        dfs(child, graph, dp, K)

        # Temporary array to store the new counts after considering this child
        temp = [0] * (K + 1)
        # For each possible carrot count for the node, update the DP values
        for carrots_parent in range(K + 1):
            for carrots_child in range(carrots_parent):
                temp[carrots_parent] += dp[node][carrots_parent] * dp[child][carrots_child]
                temp[carrots_parent] %= MOD

        # Update the DP array for the current node with the counts from temp
        dp[node] = temp

def main():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        n, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]

            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            graph[a].append(b)

    dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Start DFS from the root node, which is assumed to be 1 (Rilă Iepurilă)
    dfs(1, graph, dp, K)

    # Sum all the ways to distribute carrots to Rilă Iepurilă, excluding 0 carrots
    total_ways = sum(dp[1][1:]) % MOD

    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:

This version correctly initializes the DP table for leaf nodes, then for each non-leaf node, it considers all possible distributions of carrots for each child and updates the DP table accordingly by using a temporary array. It calculates the sum of DP values for the root node (excluding 0 carrots) to find the total number of ways to distribute the carrots.

I apologize for the confusion. There seems to be a misunderstanding in the approach to solve this problem. We need to rethink our strategy and correct the code.

We have to correctly calculate the number of ways to distribute carrots to each rabbit, considering that a child must always have strictly more carrots than its parent. The mistake seems to be in the way we combine the counts for the parent and the child. We need to iterate over the number of carrots for the child first and then use this to update the parent's distribution.

Let's fix the solution:

```python
MOD = 30011

def dfs(node, graph, dp, K):
    # Base case: if leaf node, it can have 1 to K carrots in 1 way each
    dp[node] = [1] * (K + 1)
    
    for child in graph[node]:
        dfs(child, graph, dp, K)
        
        # Temporary array to store the new counts after considering this child
        new_dp = [0] * (K + 1)
        
        # Update the DP array for the current node
        for carrots_parent in range(K + 1):
            for carrots_child in range(carrots_parent):
                new_dp[carrots_parent] += dp[node][carrots_parent] * dp[child][carrots_child]
                new_dp[carrots_parent] %= MOD
        
        dp[node] = new_dp

def main():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        n, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            graph[a].append(b)

    dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Start DFS from the root node, which is assumed to be 1 (Rilă Iepurilă)
    dfs(1, graph, dp, K)

    # Sum all the ways to distribute carrots to Rilă Iepurilă, excluding 0 carrots
    total_ways = sum(dp[1][1:]) % MOD

    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(total_ways))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this corrected version, we still start by setting the base case for leaf nodes as having 1 way to have between 1 and K carrots. Then, for a non-leaf node, we iterate over the number of carrots for the parent and the child, making sure that the child has strictly fewer carrots than the parent. After considering all children, the DP table for the node should be set correctly.

This code should give us the correct output for the given problem. Let's test it again with the provided input.

The issue with the previous solutions arises from incorrect updates to the dynamic programming table during the DFS traversal. Specifically, the number of ways in which carrots can be distributed to a parent-children group was not correctly calculated, as it did not take into account the distribution constraints between parent and children correctly.

We need to fix the dynamic programming update logic. For each parent, the number of ways to distribute a certain amount of carrots must consider the constraints imposed by each of its children. This means for each possible amount of carrots the parent can have, we must iterate over all possible amounts the children can have (which must be strictly greater than the amount for the parent) and calculate the correct number of distributions for each case.

Let's rewrite the DFS function to reflect this correct logic:

```python
MOD = 30011

def dfs(node, edges, dp, K):
    children = edges[node]
    
    # Leaf node base case
    if not children:
        for carrots in range(1, K + 1):
            dp[node][carrots] = 1
        return dp[node]

    # Initialize the distribution ways for the current node to 1
    for carrots in range(0, K + 1):
        dp[node][carrots] = 1

    # Update the number of ways for the current node based on its children
    for child in children:
        dfs(child, edges, dp, K)
        new_dp = [0] * (K + 1)
        for carrots_parent in range(1, K + 1):
            for carrots_child in range(carrots_parent + 1, K + 1):
                new_dp[carrots_parent] += dp[node][carrots_parent] * dp[child][carrots_child]
                new_dp[carrots_parent] %= MOD
        dp[node] = new_dp

def main():
    with open('iepuri.in', 'r') as file:
        N, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
        edges = {i: [] for i in range(1, N + 1)}
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            a, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
            edges[a].append(b)

    # Initialize the dynamic programming table
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(K + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    
    # Run DFS starting from the root node which is assumed to be 1
    dfs(1, edges, dp, K)

    # The answer is the sum of ways root node can have 1 to K carrots
    answer = sum(dp[1][1:]) % MOD

    with open('iepuri.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{answer}\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this updated solution, the `dfs` function correctly initializes the `dp` array for leaf nodes to represent that there is 1 way for each possible number of carrots. For non-leaf nodes, it iteratively calculates the number of ways for the node to have a certain number of carrots based on the possible counts of carrots for each of its children, considering that each child must have more carrots than the parent. This should give the correct output for the problem.
