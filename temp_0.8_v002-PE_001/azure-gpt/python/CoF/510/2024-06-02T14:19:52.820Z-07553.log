Un joc dispune de $N$ cuburi galbene și $N$ cuburi albastre, de dimensiuni identice; pe fiecare cub galben este scris un număr natural nenul, de cel mult $9$ cifre. Jocul urmărește construirea unui castel alcătuit din mai multe rânduri de cuburi, în care rândul de sus este format dintr-un singur cub, de culoare galbenă, iar fiecare dintre celelalte rânduri încep și se termină cu câte un cub de culoare galbenă. Oricare două cuburi vecine pe același rând au câte o latură comună și fiecare cub, cu excepția celor galbene de pe margine, are o latură comună cu un cub care aparține rândului de deasupra. Oricare două cuburi cu o latură comună au culori diferite. 

Rândurile de cuburi sunt numerotate de jos în sus, începând de la $1$. Pentru construcția castelului se preiau cuburile galbene în ordinea în care acestea sunt date, iar cele albastre într-o ordine oarecare, și sunt plasate pe rânduri, de jos în sus, și pe fiecare rând de la stânga la dreapta, astfel: primul cub se plasează pe rândul de la bază (numerotat cu $1$), apoi fiecare cub (galben sau albastru) se plasează fie în continuare, pe rândul curent la dreapta, fie pe un rând nou, peste un cub al rândului curent. După plasarea cubului din vârful castelului, pe fiecare cub albastru se scrie un număr egal cu suma numerelor scrise pe cei doi vecini galbeni situați pe același rând, în stânga și în dreapta sa. Pentru a câștiga jocul, castelul obținut trebuie să aibă un număr maxim de rânduri, chiar dacă poate nu folosește toate cuburile date.

# Cerințe

Cunoscând numerele scrise pe cele $N$ cuburi galbene, în ordinea dată, scrieți un program care să determine:
1. Numărul cuburilor galbene, dintre cele $N$ date, pe care sunt scrise valori de o singură cifră;
2. Rândul pe care se află cubul din vârful castelului și numărul scris pe acest cub;
3. Numărul cuburilor albastre din care este alcătuit castelul și suma tuturor numerelor de pe acestea.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `castel.in` conţine:
* Pe prima linie două numere naturale $C$ și $N$, în această ordine, despărțite printr-un spațiu, unde $C$ reprezintă numărul cerinţei și poate avea valorile $1$, $2$ sau $3$, iar $N$ are semnificația din enunț;
* Pe a doua linie, $N$ numere naturale despărțite prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând numerele scrise pe cuburile galbene, în ordinea în care sunt preluate.

# Date de ieșire
Fişierul `castel.out` conţine pe prima linie:
* Un singur număr natural pentru rezolvarea cerinței $1$, reprezentând valoarea determinată conform acestei cerințe;
* Două numere naturale despărțite printr-un spațiu, în cazul cerințelor $2$ și $3$. Pentru cerința $2$, primul număr reprezintă rândul pe care se află cubul din vârful castelului iar cel de-al doilea număr reprezintă valoarea scrisă pe acest cub. Pentru cerința $3$, prima valoare reprezintă numărul de cuburi albastre care alcătuiesc castelul, iar a doua valoare reprezintă suma tuturor numerelor scrise pe aceste cuburi.


# Restricții și precizări
* $3 \leq N \leq 5 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25$ de puncte, $C = 1$;
* Pentru $30$ de puncte, $C = 2$;
* Pentru $45$ de puncte, $C = 3$.

    return levels, top_value

# Function to solve for requirement 3
def solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes):
    levels = int(((1 + 8*len(yellow_cubes))**0.5 - 1)/2)
    blue_cubes_count = levels * (levels - 1) // 2
    yellow_sum = np.cumsum(yellow_cubes)
    left_sum = yellow_sum[levels-1::levels][:-1]
    right_sum = yellow_sum[levels-2::levels][1:]
    blue_sum = left_sum + right_sum
    total_blue_sum = np.sum(blue_sum)
    return blue_cubes_count, total_blue_sum

# Switch to handle the different requirements
if C == 1:
    result = solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 2:
    result = solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 3:
    result = solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes)

# Write the result to "castel.out"

        outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
```

This code will read a problem description from "castel.in" and then depending on the requirement, it will calculate the necessary information and write it to "castel.out". The code uses numpy for efficient array operations and minimizes memory usage by avoiding unnecessary data structures or loops. The code should also be time-optimized due to numpy's internal optimizations for array operations.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which means that `numpy` is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the code must be efficient in both time and memory usage, I will rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other third-party libraries, relying only on built-in Python libraries.

Here is the rewritten solution, using only standard Python functionality:

```python
# Function to solve for requirement 1
def solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes):
    single_digit_count = sum(1 for x in yellow_cubes if x < 10)
    return single_digit_count

# Function to solve for requirement 2
def solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes):
    levels = int(((1 + 8 * len(yellow_cubes))**0.5 - 1) / 2)
    top_value = yellow_cubes[levels - 1]
    return levels, top_value

# Function to solve for requirement 3
def solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes):
    levels = int(((1 + 8 * len(yellow_cubes))**0.5 - 1) / 2)
    blue_cubes_count = levels * (levels - 1) // 2
    yellow_sum = [0] * (levels + 1)
    for i in range(levels):
        yellow_sum[i + 1] = yellow_sum[i] + yellow_cubes[i]

    blue_sum = sum(yellow_sum[i] + yellow_sum[i + 2] for i in range(1, levels - 1))
    total_blue_sum = blue_sum
    return blue_cubes_count, total_blue_sum

# Read the input from "castel.in"
with open("castel.in", "r") as infile:
    C, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    yellow_cubes = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Switch to handle the different requirements
if C == 1:
    result = solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 2:
    result = solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 3:
    result = solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes)

# Write the result to "castel.out"
with open("castel.out", "w") as outfile:
    if C == 1:
        outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
```

This solution completely removes the dependency on `numpy` and uses simple Python lists and built-in functions to perform the necessary calculations. It handles the input and output files as specified in the problem statement and should meet the performance requirements within the memory constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result for requirement 2 indicates that there is a mistake in the calculation of the value of the top yellow cube. The incorrect output suggests the code is incorrectly identifying the value of the top cube on the pyramid.

In the current implementation, the `solve_requirement_2` function determines the number of levels based on the total number of yellow cubes, which is correct, but it then mistakenly takes the value of the top yellow cube as the last cube in the `yellow_cubes` list that belongs to the last level. However, according to the rules of the game, the top yellow cube should be the first cube of the `yellow_cubes` list that belongs to the highest level.

Let's fix the `solve_requirement_2` function by correctly identifying the top cube:

```python
# Function to solve for requirement 2
def solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes):
    # Calculate the number of completed levels
    levels = 1
    while levels * (levels + 1) // 2 <= len(yellow_cubes):
        levels += 1
    levels -= 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last fully completed level

    # The top value is the first cube of the last completed level
    top_cube_index = levels * (levels - 1) // 2
    top_value = yellow_cubes[top_cube_index]
    return levels, top_value

# The rest of the code remains the same

# Read the input from "castel.in"
with open("castel.in", "r") as infile:
    C, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    yellow_cubes = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Switch to handle the different requirements
if C == 1:
    result = solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 2:
    result = solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 3:
    result = solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes)

# Write the result to "castel.out"
with open("castel.out", "w") as outfile:
    if C == 1:
        outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
```

This should correctly identify the number of levels and the value of the top yellow cube and produce the expected result for the given input.

The error indicates that the function `solve_requirement_1` is not defined in the code, which is a mistake since I included only the fixed `solve_requirement_2` function and did not define `solve_requirement_1` or `solve_requirement_3`.

Let's correct the solution by including the definitions for all three functions, and ensuring that they are correctly implemented:

```python
# Function to solve for requirement 1
def solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes):
    single_digit_count = sum(1 for x in yellow_cubes if x < 10)
    return single_digit_count

# Function to solve for requirement 2
def solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes):
    # Calculate the number of completed levels
    levels = 1
    while levels * (levels + 1) // 2 <= len(yellow_cubes):
        levels += 1
    levels -= 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last fully completed level

    # The top value is the first cube of the last completed level
    top_cube_index = levels * (levels - 1) // 2
    top_value = yellow_cubes[top_cube_index]
    return levels, top_value

# Function to solve for requirement 3
def solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes):
    levels = 1
    while levels * (levels + 1) // 2 <= len(yellow_cubes):
        levels += 1
    levels -= 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last fully completed level

    blue_cubes_count = levels * (levels - 1) // 2
    blue_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, levels):
        blue_sum += yellow_cubes[i-1] + yellow_cubes[i]
    total_blue_sum = blue_sum
    return blue_cubes_count, total_blue_sum

# Read the input from "castel.in"
with open("castel.in", "r") as infile:
    C, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    yellow_cubes = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Switch to handle the different requirements
if C == 1:
    result = solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 2:
    result = solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 3:
    result = solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes)

# Write the result to "castel.out"
with open("castel.out", "w") as outfile:
    if C == 1:
        outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
```

With all three functions defined and the `solve_requirement_2` function fixed, the program should now execute correctly without errors and produce the expected result. The `solve_requirement_3` function was also updated to iterate correctly through the yellow cubes to calculate the sum of numbers on the blue cubes.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results for requirement 2 indicates that there is still an issue with finding the correct value of the top cube on the pyramid. The corrected algorithm should calculate the number of levels correctly, but it seems that the value chosen for the top cube is incorrect.

Observing the problem statement, the top cube is not necessarily the first cube of the last completed level. The top cube is actually the cube that would be placed last, given the total number of cubes available. This means it is the last cube that would be placed on the pyramid before an additional level could not be fully supported.

Let's correct the logic for `solve_requirement_2` to reflect this rule:

```python
# Function to solve for requirement 2
def solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes):
    # Calculate the number of completed levels
    levels = 1
    while levels * (levels + 1) // 2 <= len(yellow_cubes):
        levels += 1
    levels -= 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last fully completed level

    # The top value is the last cube used, which is also the last cube of the last full level
    top_cube_index = levels * (levels + 1) // 2 - 1
    top_value = yellow_cubes[top_cube_index]
    return levels, top_value

# The rest of the code for requirements 1 and 3 remains the same

# Read the input from "castel.in"
with open("castel.in", "r") as infile:
    C, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    yellow_cubes = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Switch to handle the different requirements
if C == 1:
    result = solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 2:
    result = solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 3:
    result = solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes)

# Write the result to "castel.out"
with open("castel.out", "w") as outfile:
    if C == 1:
        outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
```

With this new logic, the function `solve_requirement_2` should now correctly identify the last cube that was placed on the pyramid, which should coincide with the last cube of the last fully completed level. This should produce the expected output of "4 5" for the given input.

The error message indicates that the function `solve_requirement_1` is not defined in the code, which implies that I have not included the definition of this function in my previous response. I apologize for the oversight.

Let's redefine all three functions and ensure they are included in the code to handle each requirement properly:

```python
# Function to solve for requirement 1
def solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes):
    single_digit_count = sum(1 for x in yellow_cubes if x < 10)
    return single_digit_count

# Function to solve for requirement 2
def solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes):
    # Calculate the number of completed levels
    levels = 1
    while (levels * (levels + 1)) // 2 <= len(yellow_cubes):
        levels += 1
    levels -= 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last fully completed level

    # The top value is the last cube of the last completed level
    top_cube_index = (levels * (levels + 1)) // 2 - 1
    top_value = yellow_cubes[top_cube_index]
    return levels, top_value

# Function to solve for requirement 3
def solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes):
    levels = 1
    while (levels * (levels + 1)) // 2 <= len(yellow_cubes):
        levels += 1
    levels -= 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last fully completed level

    blue_cubes_count = (levels - 1) * levels // 2
    blue_sum = sum(yellow_cubes[i] + yellow_cubes[i+1] for i in range(levels-1))
    return blue_cubes_count, blue_sum

# Read the input from "castel.in"
with open("castel.in", "r") as infile:
    C, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    yellow_cubes = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Switch to handle the different requirements
if C == 1:
    result = solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 2:
    result = solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 3:
    result = solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes)

# Write the result to "castel.out"

        outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
```

The above code defines all the necessary functions and should solve each requirement correctly. It includes the correct logic to determine the top cube's value by finding the last cube of the last fully completed level. The code should now execute correctly and produce the expected output for any of the three requirements.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results for requirement 3 signifies a problem with the calculation of the sum of the numbers on the blue cubes. The logic for summing the numbers on the blue cubes is not correctly implemented.

According to the problem statement, each blue cube's number is equal to the sum of the numbers on the two adjacent yellow cubes on the same level. However, the code is incorrectly summing sequential yellow cubes instead of correctly pairing adjacent yellow cubes to calculate the blue cubes' numbers.

Here is the correct logic to calculate the sum of the numbers on the blue cubes:
- For each level except the top one, sum the numbers on the two yellow cubes adjacent to each blue cube.
- The blue cube numbers on level `i` are the sum of yellow cube numbers on level `i` and level `i+1`

Let's rewrite the `solve_requirement_3` function to apply the correct logic:

```python
# Function to solve for requirement 3
def solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes):
    levels = 1
    while (levels * (levels + 1)) // 2 <= len(yellow_cubes):
        levels += 1
    levels -= 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last fully completed level

    blue_cubes_count = (levels - 1) * levels // 2
    total_blue_sum = 0
    yellow_index = 0  # Index to keep track of the yellow cubes
    
    for level in range(1, levels):
        # Sum numbers for blue cubes on the current level
        for i in range(level):
            total_blue_sum += yellow_cubes[yellow_index + i] + yellow_cubes[yellow_index + i + 1]
        yellow_index += level  # Move to the next level of yellow cubes

    return blue_cubes_count, total_blue_sum

# The rest of the code for requirements 1 and 2 remains the same

# Read the input from "castel.in"
with open("castel.in", "r") as infile:
    C, N = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    yellow_cubes = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Switch to handle the different requirements
if C == 1:
    result = solve_requirement_1(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 2:
    result = solve_requirement_2(yellow_cubes)
elif C == 3:
    result = solve_requirement_3(yellow_cubes)

# Write the result to "castel.out"
with open("castel.out", "w") as outfile:
    if C == 1:
        outfile.write(f"{result}\n")
    else:
        outfile.write(f"{result[0]} {result[1]}\n")
```

With this corrected approach, the `solve_requirement_3` function should now correctly calculate the total sum of the numbers on the blue cubes by correctly summing the numbers of the adjacent yellow cubes, which will result in the expected output of "6 110" for the given input.
