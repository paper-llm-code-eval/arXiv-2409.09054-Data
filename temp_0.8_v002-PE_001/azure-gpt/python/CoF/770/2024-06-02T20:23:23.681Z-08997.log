La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the data from the file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    data = np.loadtxt(file, dtype=np.int32, ndmin=2)

# Sort the data first by county (J) then by student id (E)
sorted_data = data[data[:, 0].argsort(kind='mergesort')]
sorted_data = sorted_data[sorted_data[:, 1].argsort(kind='mergesort')]

# Calculate the number of counties and number of students per county
unique_counties, indices, counts = np.unique(sorted_data[:, 0], return_index=True, return_counts=True)
NJ = len(unique_counties)

# Start building the required list
result_list = []
county_indices = defaultdict(int)
for _ in range(P):
    for county in unique_counties:
        student_list_index = indices[county - 1] + county_indices[county]
        if county_indices[county] < counts[county - 1]:
            result_list.append(sorted_data[student_list_index])
            county_indices[county] += 1
            break

# Write to the output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NJ}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, counts)) + "\n")
    for student in result_list:
        file.write(" ".join(map(str, student)) + "\n")
```

This solution reads data from `concurs.in`, processes it to meet the requirements, and writes the output to `concurs.out`. The memory usage is within the constraints as it leverages numpy for efficient array operations. The code uses sorting with 'mergesort' algorithm in numpy, which is a stable sort and has O(n log n) complexity, ensuring that the order of students within a county is preserved. The output is built by iterating over the unique counties and selecting the next student from each county in turn, ensuring no two consecutive students are from the same county and that students from a county are listed in increasing order of their identifiers.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which means that `numpy` is not installed in the environment where the code is being run. However, the challenge description restricts the use of external libraries like `numpy` due to memory constraints.

Given these circumstances, I will re-write the solution without using `numpy` or any other external library. Instead, I will use built-in Python data structures and functions to solve the problem efficiently. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read the data from the file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    data = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the data first by county (J) then by student id (E)
data.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

# Calculate the number of counties and number of students per county
counties = defaultdict(int)
for county_id, _ in data:
    counties[county_id] += 1
NJ = len(counties)

# Initialize a dictionary to store the sorted students per county
students_per_county = defaultdict(deque)
for county_id, student_id in data:
    students_per_county[county_id].append(student_id)

# Start building the required list
result_list = []
last_county = -1
for _ in range(P):
    for county in sorted(counties.keys()):
        if counties[county] > 0 and county != last_county:
            student_id = students_per_county[county].popleft()
            result_list.append((county, student_id))
            counties[county] -= 1
            last_county = county
            break

# Write to the output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NJ}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(str(counties[county]) for county in sorted(counties.keys())) + "\n")
    for county, student_id in result_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student_id}\n")
```
This solution uses the Python `sort` method for sorting, which is based on Timsort and has O(n log n) complexity. It also uses a `defaultdict` to count the students per county and a `deque` to store student IDs for efficient append and popleft operations. The writing of the `result_list` ensures that no two consecutive students are from the same county. This solution should meet both the time complexity and memory usage requirements of the challenge.

The issue with the previous solution is that it initializes the `students_per_county` dictionary with the total counts of students from each county but does not update it correctly after each student is listed in the result. Additionally, the first line of county participants' count in the output is incorrect because it directly uses the initial counts dictionary without considering that some students have already been listed.

To fix the solution, we need to make the following changes:

1. Instead of using a dictionary with integers for `students_per_county`, we should use a `deque` to store and retrieve the students for each county in the correct order.
2. Update the counts for each county as we append students to the `result_list`, not by decrementing the value in `counties` dictionary but by checking the lengths of the deques in `students_per_county`.
3. Write the initial counts of each county by checking the lengths of the deques before we start appending students to `result_list`.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the data from the file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    data = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the data first by county (J) then by student id (E)
data.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

# Initialize a dictionary to store the sorted students per county
students_per_county = defaultdict(list)
for county_id, student_id in data:
    students_per_county[county_id].append(student_id)

# Calculate the number of counties and number of students per county
NJ = len(students_per_county)
students_count = {county: len(students) for county, students in students_per_county.items()}

# Start building the required list
result_list = []
last_county = -1
while len(result_list) < P:
    for county in sorted(students_per_county.keys()):
        if students_per_county[county] and county != last_county:
            student_id = students_per_county[county].pop(0)
            result_list.append((county, student_id))
            last_county = county
            break

# Write to the output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NJ}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(str(students_count[county]) for county in sorted(students_count.keys())) + "\n")
    for county, student_id in result_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution maintains a list for each county in `students_per_county` and pops students from the front of these lists to ensure proper order. The `students_count` dictionary is used to store the total number of students for each county before the loop that builds the result list. The adjusted solution should now produce the expected output.

The issue in the previous solution is that the algorithm does not correctly alternate between counties when selecting the next student. The expected output requires that no two consecutive students should be from the same county, but the algorithm from the previous solution doesn't maintain this condition effectively.

Let's implement a solution that ensures this condition is met:

1. Sort the students in each county.
2. Keep track of the last added county to ensure no two consecutive students are from the same county.
3. Use a deque or a list to hold the students from each county and rotate through counties by populating the result list until all students are listed.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the data from the file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the participants by county and student id
participants.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

# Organize the participants by county
counties_dict = defaultdict(list)
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    counties_dict[county_id].append(student_id)

# Calculate the number of counties and number of students per county
NJ = len(counties_dict)
students_count = [len(students) for _, students in sorted(counties_dict.items())]

# Prepare the result list
result_list = []
last_county = 0
counties = sorted(counties_dict.keys())

while len(result_list) < P:
    for county in counties:
        if counties_dict[county] and county != last_county:
            student_id = counties_dict[county].pop(0)
            result_list.append((county, student_id))
            last_county = county
            break

# Write to the output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NJ}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, students_count)) + "\n")
    for county, student_id in result_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution should now produce the expected output by correctly alternating between counties when constructing the result list, ensuring that no two consecutive students are from the same county while maintaining the condition that students within a county are listed in increasing order of their identifiers.

The previously provided solutions did not guarantee that consecutive students come from different counties. What we need is a round-robin approach to cycle through counties, while ensuring that we pick students in the ascending order of their IDs, and not picking students from the same county consecutively. Here is an approach that ensures these criteria:

1. Group students by county and sort each group.
2. Use a round-robin fashion to pick one student from each county until all students are picked.
3. Ensure that we do not pick a student from the same county consecutively.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read the data from the file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the participants by county and student id
participants.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

# Organize the participants by county
counties_dict = defaultdict(deque)
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    counties_dict[county_id].append(student_id)

# Calculate the number of counties and number of students per county
NJ = len(counties_dict)
students_count = [len(students) for _, students in sorted(counties_dict.items())]

# Prepare the result list using a round-robin fashion
result_list = []
counties_queue = deque(sorted(counties_dict.keys()))
previous_county = -1

while len(result_list) < P:
    county = counties_queue.popleft()
    # If the county has students left and it's not the same as the previous one
    if counties_dict[county] and county != previous_county:
        student_id = counties_dict[county].popleft()
        result_list.append((county, student_id))
        previous_county = county
    # If there are still students in the county, append it back to the queue
    if counties_dict[county]:
        counties_queue.append(county)

# Write to the output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NJ}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, students_count)) + "\n")
    for county, student_id in result_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution should now produce the expected output by cycling through the counties in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that no consecutive students are from the same county, and that within each county, students are picked in increasing order of their identifiers. This round-robin approach is managed by a deque (counties_queue) which efficiently rotates through the counties.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was killed because it exceeded the memory limits or was terminated by the system (often due to running out of memory). Since the standard error doesn't provide additional information, we can only speculate that the program used more memory than allowed.

Given that the input size is not very large (500 students maximum) and the limitations in terms of libraries and memory usage, we should attempt to solve the problem using simple Python data structures and efficient algorithms without external libraries.

Here's the solution rewritten to ensure minimal memory usage:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort participants by county, then by student ID within each county
participants.sort()

# Organize participants by county
county_participants = {}
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    if county_id not in county_participants:
        county_participants[county_id] = []
    county_participants[county_id].append(student_id)

# Round-robin selection of students from each county
NJ = len(county_participants)
result_list = []
counties = list(county_participants.keys())
index_per_county = [0] * NJ  # Tracks the next student to select from each county

# Find the total number of participants per county to be written to file
county_counts = [len(county_participants[county]) for county in counties]

# Perform round-robin selection
while len(result_list) < P:
    for i, county in enumerate(counties):
        # Only add if there are students left to pick from this county
        if index_per_county[i] < county_counts[i]:
            student_id = county_participants[county][index_per_county[i]]
            index_per_county[i] += 1
            result_list.append((county, student_id))
            # Break the loop to ensure we pick from a different county next
            break

# Write output to file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NJ}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, county_counts)) + "\n")
    for county_id, student_id in result_list:
        file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution should work within the given memory constraints. It processes the input data and generates the output list without using excess memory, relying solely on built-in Python data structures and functions. The round-robin algorithm is now implemented using simple lists and indexing to keep track of the next student to select from each county.

The output differs from the expected result because the previous solution did not alternate between counties with each pick of a student. Instead, it selected all available students from a county before moving on to the next county, violating a primary rule of the problem.

To fix the solution, we need to ensure that after picking a student from a county, we move on to the next county for the subsequent pick. Here is a rewritten solution that maintains a rotating list of counties to alternate between them:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Read the data from the file
with open('concurs.in', 'r') as file:
    P = int(file.readline().strip())
    participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]

# Sort the participants by county and then by student id
participants.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

# Group students by county
students_by_county = defaultdict(deque)
for county_id, student_id in participants:
    students_by_county[county_id].append(student_id)

# List of counties sorted by their id
counties = sorted(students_by_county.keys())
# Deque for county rotation
county_rotation = deque(counties)

# Prepare the result list
result_list = []
last_county = -1

while len(result_list) < P:
    county = county_rotation.popleft()
    # Pick a student from a different county than the last one
    if county != last_county and students_by_county[county]:
        student_id = students_by_county[county].popleft()
        result_list.append((county, student_id))
        last_county = county
    
    # If the current county still has students, append it back to the rotation
    if students_by_county[county]:
        county_rotation.append(county)

# Calculate the number of counties and number of students per county
NJ = len(students_by_county)
county_counts = [len(v) for k, v in sorted(students_by_county.items())]

# Write to the output file
with open('concurs.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NJ}\n")
    file.write(" ".join(map(str, county_counts)) + "\n")
    for county, student_id in result_list:
        file.write(f"{county} {student_id}\n")
```

This solution ensures that we rotate through all counties by using a `deque` for `county_rotation`. After picking a student from a county, if there are still students left in that county, it is added to the end of the rotation. This guarantees that students from the same county are not picked consecutively, and all students within a county are still picked in ascending order.
