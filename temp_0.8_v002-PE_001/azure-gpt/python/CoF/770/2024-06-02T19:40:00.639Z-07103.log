La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

This solution assumes that the input file `concurs.in` is formatted correctly and that the constraints on memory and number of participants are adhered to. The provided code does not use more memory than necessary and leverages numpy's efficient array operations for sorting and manipulation, making it both time and memory efficient. It writes the required output to `concurs.out` as outlined in the problem statement.

This updated version of the solution reads from `concurs.in` and writes to `concurs.out`. It does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations. The processing of participants is done using numpy arrays and operations, which are efficient in terms of memory and performance. The solution generates the list according to the rules specified by sorting and iterating in a way that avoids consecutive participants being from the same county.

I apologize for any potential confusion in the previous responses. Below is the full solution in a markdown code block, following the requirements as specified:

```python
import numpy as np

def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    num_participants = int(lines[0].strip())
    participants = np.array([list(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines[1:]], dtype=np.int32)
    return num_participants, participants

def write_output(filename, num_counties, county_participants, participant_list):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_counties}\n")
        file.write(" ".join(map(str, county_participants)) + "\n")
        for county_id, student_id in participant_list:
            file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")

def prepare_list(num_participants, participants):
    # Sort by county and then by student ID
    participants_sorted = participants[participants[:, 0].argsort(kind='mergesort')]
    participants_sorted = participants_sorted[participants_sorted[:, 1].argsort(kind='mergesort')]
    
    # Count participants per county
    counties, county_indices = np.unique(participants_sorted[:, 0], return_index=True)
    num_counties = len(counties)
    county_participants = np.diff(np.append(county_indices, num_participants))

    # Generate the list
    participant_list = []
    county_position = np.zeros(num_counties, dtype=np.int32)
    for _ in range(num_participants):
        for i in range(num_counties):
            if county_position[i] < county_participants[i]:
                county_idx = counties[i]
                student_idx = participants_sorted[county_indices[i] + county_position[i], 1]
                participant_list.append((county_idx, student_idx))
                county_position[i] += 1
                break
    
    return num_counties, county_participants, participant_list

# Read input data
num_participants, participants = read_input('concurs.in')

# Prepare the participant list
num_counties, county_participants, participant_list = prepare_list(num_participants, participants)

# Write output data
write_output('concurs.out', num_counties, county_participants, participant_list)
```

This Python solution will read data from `concurs.in`, process it according to the problem's requirements, and write the result to `concurs.out`. It follows the restrictions and does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O. The solution employs NumPy for efficient array manipulation and employs algorithms that consider both time complexity and memory constraints.

It appears that the Python environment where the code is being executed does not have the NumPy library installed. Considering the memory constraint and that we are not allowed to use NumPy, I will rewrite the solution using only built-in Python types and functions to ensure compatibility and adherence to the constraints.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        num_participants = int(file.readline().strip())
        participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]
    return num_participants, participants

def write_output(filename, county_info, sorted_participants):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(county_info)}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(str(count) for _, count in sorted(county_info)) + '\n')
        for county_id, student_id in sorted_participants:
            file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")

def arrange_participants(num_participants, participants):
    # Sort participants by county and student ID
    participants.sort()
    
    # Collect county information
    county_info = {}
    for county_id, student_id in participants:
        if county_id in county_info:
            county_info[county_id].append(student_id)
        else:
            county_info[county_id] = [student_id]

    # Prepare the output list
    sorted_participants = []
    while len(sorted_participants) < num_participants:
        for county_id in sorted(county_info.keys()):
            if county_info[county_id]:
                sorted_participants.append((county_id, county_info[county_id].pop(0)))

    return sorted([(county_id, len(county_info[county_id])) for county_id in county_info]), sorted_participants

# Read input data
num_participants, participants = read_input('concurs.in')

# Arrange participants
county_info, sorted_participants = arrange_participants(num_participants, participants)

# Write output data
write_output('concurs.out', county_info, sorted_participants)
```

This code no longer uses NumPy and instead relies on lists and dictionary data structures, which should work in any standard Python environment. The code reads from `concurs.in`, processes the participants, and writes the output to `concurs.out` as required by the problem statement.

The differences between the expected and found result are due to incorrect processing of the number of participants from each county. My previous implementation was correctly sorting the students but was not tracking the number of participants from each county correctly. It initialized the county information with empty lists and did not update the participant count for each county.

Let's fix the code. We need to correctly count the number of participants from each county and ensure the participants are listed by alternating counties, maintaining the internal order of student IDs within each county.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        num_participants = int(file.readline().strip())
        participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]
    return num_participants, participants

def write_output(filename, county_info, sorted_participants):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(county_info)}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(str(count) for _, count in sorted(county_info)) + '\n')
        for county_id, student_id in sorted_participants:
            file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")

def arrange_participants(num_participants, participants):
    # Sort participants by county and student ID
    participants.sort()
    
    # Collect county information
    county_info = {}
    for county_id, student_id in participants:
        if county_id in county_info:
            county_info[county_id].append(student_id)
        else:
            county_info[county_id] = [student_id]

    # Prepare the output list
    sorted_participants = []
    county_keys = sorted(county_info)
    indexes = {key: 0 for key in county_keys}
    while len(sorted_participants) < num_participants:
        for county_id in county_keys:
            students = county_info[county_id]
            if indexes[county_id] < len(students):
                sorted_participants.append((county_id, students[indexes[county_id]]))
                indexes[county_id] += 1

    county_participant_counts = sorted([(county_id, len(students)) for county_id, students in county_info.items()])
    return county_participant_counts, sorted_participants

# Read input data
num_participants, participants = read_input('concurs.in')

# Arrange participants
county_info, sorted_participants = arrange_participants(num_participants, participants)

# Write output data
write_output('concurs.out', county_info, sorted_participants)
```

This code now correctly calculates the number of participants from each county and alternates between counties when listing participants. It sorts the counties and uses an index tracker to iterate over student IDs for each county, ensuring that we don't have consecutive students from the same county.

Please note that the order of students may not be unique since the problem allows for multiple correct solutions as long as the conditions are met. This solution should now match the expected result in terms of format and the rules specified.

The result differs from the expected output because the algorithm does not enforce the rule that two consecutive students cannot be from the same county. Instead, it just cycles through the counties in order, which can result in two consecutive students being from the same county if they are at the border of two county ranges.

To fix the logic, we need to ensure that after selecting a student from a county, the next student must be from a different county. For this, we can use a flag to track if we have picked a student from a county in the iteration, and once we do, we skip that county in the next iteration.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        num_participants = int(file.readline().strip())
        participants = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in file]
    return num_participants, participants

def write_output(filename, county_info, sorted_participants):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{len(county_info)}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(str(count) for _, count in county_info) + '\n')
        for county_id, student_id in sorted_participants:
            file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")

def arrange_participants(num_participants, participants):
    # Group participants by county and sort by student ID within each county
    county_info = {}
    for county_id, student_id in participants:
        if county_id not in county_info:
            county_info[county_id] = []
        county_info[county_id].append(student_id)
    for county_id in county_info:
        county_info[county_id].sort()

    # Create the sorted participants list
    sorted_participants = []
    last_county = -1
    while len(sorted_participants) < num_participants:
        for county_id in sorted(county_info.keys()):
            if county_id != last_county and county_info[county_id]:
                student_id = county_info[county_id].pop(0)
                sorted_participants.append((county_id, student_id))
                last_county = county_id
                break

    county_participant_counts = sorted((county_id, len(students)) for county_id, students in county_info.items())
    return county_participant_counts, sorted_participants

# Read input data
num_participants, participants = read_input('concurs.in')

# Arrange participants
county_info, sorted_participants = arrange_participants(num_participants, participants)

# Write output data
write_output('concurs.out', county_info, sorted_participants)
```

This updated solution should now correctly enforce the rule and create an ordered list of participants where no two consecutive students are from the same county. The participants are grouped and sorted by their counties, and then a participant from each county is selected in a way that prevents the same county from being selected consecutively. The output is written to `concurs.out` as expected.
