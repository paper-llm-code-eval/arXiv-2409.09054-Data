La Olimpiada Naţională de Informatică participă elevi din mai multe judeţe, fiecare judeţ fiind identificat în mod unic printr-un număr natural. Elevii din fiecare judeţ au asociat câte un număr natural care permite identificarea în mod unic a elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Astfel, orice participant la olimpiadă poate fi identificat prin două numere: identificatorul judeţului şi identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

Pentru a repartiza elevii la calculatoare, organizatorii au nevoie de o listă care să respecte următoarele condiţii:
- lista conţine toţi elevii participanţi la olimpiadă;
- oricare doi elevi consecutivi în listă sunt din judeţe diferite;
- elevii din orice judeţ apar în listă în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare.

# Cerinţă
Scrieţi un program care să genereze lista necesară organizatorilor.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `concurs.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $P$ reprezentând numărul total de participanţi la ONI. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista participanţilor, câte un participant pe o linie. Pentru fiecare participant sunt scrise două numere naturale separate prin spaţiu $J$ și $E$, unde $J$ reprezintă identificatorul judeţului, iar $E$ reprezintă identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `concurs.out` va conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $NJ$, reprezentând numărul de judeţe din care există participanţi la olimpiadă.

Pe cea de-a doua linie sunt scrise $NJ$ numere naturale nenule separate prin câte un spaţiu reprezentând (în ordinea crescătoare a numerelor de identificare a judeţelor) numărul de participanţi din fiecare judeţ. Pe următoarele $P$ linii este descrisă lista necesară organizatorilor, câte un elev pe o linie. Pentru fiecare elev este scris mai întâi identificatorul judeţului din care face parte, urmat de un spaţiu, apoi de identificatorul elevului în cadrul judeţului.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- Identificatorii judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $50$.
- Identificatorii elevilor în cadrul judeţelor sunt numere naturale cuprinse între $1$ şi $1\ 000$.
- Numărul total de elevi participanţi la olimpiadă nu depăşeşte $500$.
- Pentru datele de test există întotdeauna soluţie, nu neapărat unică.
- Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj. Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de judeţe, precum şi a numărului de participanţi din fiecare judeţ se acordă $30\%$ din punctaj. Punctajul se acordă integral pentru rezolvarea tuturor celor 3 cerinţe (număr de judeţe, număr de participanţi din fiecare judeţ şi lista necesară organizatorilor).

Here is the complete Python code that reads from `concurs.in`, processes the data according to the requirements, and writes the output to `concurs.out`. The code is optimized for memory usage:

```python
import numpy as np

def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        num_students = int(file.readline().strip())
        students = np.empty((num_students, 2), dtype=int)
        for i in range(num_students):
            students[i] = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return students

def write_output(filename, num_counties, students_per_county, sorted_students):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_counties}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, students_per_county)) + '\n')
        for county_id, student_id in sorted_students:
            file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")

def arrange_students(students):
    # Sort students by county and then by student ID using numpy
    students = students[np.lexsort((students[:,1], students[:,0]))]
    
    county_dict = {}
    for county_id, student_id in students:
        if county_id not in county_dict:
            county_dict[county_id] = []
        county_dict[county_id].append(student_id)
    
    sorted_county_keys = sorted(county_dict.keys())
    sorted_students = []

    # Initialize the pointers for each county to the first student
    pointers = np.zeros(len(sorted_county_keys), dtype=int)
    
    # Used to track the last county we placed a student from
    last_county = -1

    while len(sorted_students) < len(students):
        for idx, county in enumerate(sorted_county_keys):
            # Check if this county is not the last one we used and it still has students left
            if county != last_county and pointers[idx] < len(county_dict[county]):
                sorted_students.append((county, county_dict[county][pointers[idx]]))
                pointers[idx] += 1
                last_county = county
                break

    return sorted_students, sorted_county_keys

students = read_input('concurs.in')
arranged_students, sorted_county_keys = arrange_students(students)
students_per_county = [len(county_dict[county]) for county in sorted_county_keys]
write_output('concurs.out', len(sorted_county_keys), students_per_county, arranged_students)
```

This code uses numpy arrays to efficiently store and sort the students and minimizes memory usage by avoiding unnecessary data copies.

Since the numpy module is not installed or available in the environment, I will rewrite the solution without using numpy or any other external libraries. I will stick to Python's standard library to ensure that the program can run in any standard Python environment.

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        num_students = int(file.readline().strip())
        students = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(num_students)]
    return students

def write_output(filename, num_counties, students_per_county, sorted_students):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_counties}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, students_per_county)) + '\n')
        for county_id, student_id in sorted_students:
            file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")

def sort_students(students):
    # Sort students by county and then by student ID
    students.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    return students

def arrange_students(students):
    county_dict = {}
    for county_id, student_id in students:
        if county_id not in county_dict:
            county_dict[county_id] = []
        county_dict[county_id].append(student_id)
    
    sorted_county_keys = sorted(county_dict.keys())
    sorted_students = []

    # Initialize the pointers for each county to the first student
    pointers = {county: 0 for county in sorted_county_keys}
    
    # Used to track the last county we placed a student from
    last_county = -1

    while len(sorted_students) < len(students):
        for county in sorted_county_keys:
            # Check if this county is not the last one we used and it still has students left
            if county != last_county and pointers[county] < len(county_dict[county]):
                sorted_students.append((county, county_dict[county][pointers[county]]))
                pointers[county] += 1
                last_county = county
                break

    return sorted_students, sorted_county_keys

students = read_input('concurs.in')
sorted_students = sort_students(students)
arranged_students, sorted_county_keys = arrange_students(sorted_students)
students_per_county = [len(county_dict[county]) for county in sorted_county_keys]
write_output('concurs.out', len(sorted_county_keys), students_per_county, arranged_students)
```

This solution is based on Python's built-in data structures and sorting mechanisms, which should satisfy the constraints of the challenge.

The error message indicates that `county_dict` is not defined in the scope where we are trying to use it to generate `students_per_county`. This is because the `county_dict` was defined locally within the `arrange_students` function, and we need to return it from there to be able to use it for further processing.

Let's fix the code by returning `county_dict` from the `arrange_students` function and using it in the main section of the program to fix the scope issue:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        num_students = int(file.readline().strip())
        students = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(num_students)]
    return students

def write_output(filename, num_counties, students_per_county, sorted_students):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_counties}\n")
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, students_per_county)) + '\n')
        for county_id, student_id in sorted_students:
            file.write(f"{county_id} {student_id}\n")

def arrange_students(students):
    county_dict = {}
    for county_id, student_id in students:
        if county_id not in county_dict:
            county_dict[county_id] = []
        county_dict[county_id].append(student_id)
    
    sorted_county_keys = sorted(county_dict.keys())
    sorted_students = []
    pointers = {county: 0 for county in sorted_county_keys}
    last_county = -1

    while len(sorted_students) < len(students):
        for county in sorted_county_keys:
            if county != last_county and pointers[county] < len(county_dict[county]):
                sorted_students.append((county, county_dict[county][pointers[county]]))
                pointers[county] += 1
                last_county = county
                break

    return sorted_students, sorted_county_keys, county_dict

students = read_input('concurs.in')
arranged_students, sorted_county_keys, county_dict = arrange_students(students)
students_per_county = [len(county_dict[county]) for county in sorted_county_keys]
write_output('concurs.out', len(sorted_county_keys), students_per_county, arranged_students)
```

This corrected code should work without raising a `NameError`, as the `county_dict` is now properly returned from the `arrange_students` function and made available in the main scope of the program.

The expected output indicates that students from each county should be listed in increasing order, but the solution must also ensure that no two consecutive students in the output list are from the same county. The current implementation fails to alternate counties correctly because it always resumes the search for the next student from the start of the sorted list of county keys, which can lead to listing students from the same county consecutively if no other counties have remaining students.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the last county we placed a student from and ensure that we continue the search for the next student from the next county in the sorted order. To achieve this, we should maintain the current position in the sorted list of county keys and start the search for the next student from the next county after the last one we used.

Let's rewrite the `arrange_students` function to implement this logic correctly:

```python
def arrange_students(students):
    county_dict = {}
    for county_id, student_id in students:
        if county_id not in county_dict:
            county_dict[county_id] = []
        county_dict[county_id].append(student_id)
    
    sorted_county_keys = sorted(county_dict.keys())
    sorted_students = []
    pointers = {county: 0 for county in sorted_county_keys}
    idx_last_county = -1  # Index of the last county used

    while len(sorted_students) < len(students):
        idx_start = (idx_last_county + 1) % len(sorted_county_keys)  # Start from the next county
        for i in range(len(sorted_county_keys)):
            # Loop around the counties starting from idx_start
            idx_current = (idx_start + i) % len(sorted_county_keys)
            county = sorted_county_keys[idx_current]
            if pointers[county] < len(county_dict[county]):
                sorted_students.append((county, county_dict[county][pointers[county]]))
                pointers[county] += 1
                idx_last_county = idx_current
                break

    return sorted_students, sorted_county_keys, county_dict

# The rest of the program remains unchanged
students = read_input('concurs.in')
arranged_students, sorted_county_keys, county_dict = arrange_students(students)
students_per_county = [len(county_dict[county]) for county in sorted_county_keys]
write_output('concurs.out', len(sorted_county_keys), students_per_county, arranged_students)
```

This revised `arrange_students` function now maintains the index of the last county used (`idx_last_county`) and starts the search for the next student from the next county in the sorted list, ensuring that no two consecutive students are from the same county. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output.

It seems there was some confusion, as the error message indicated that `read_input` is not defined. This likely occurred because the code snippet provided was just the `arrange_students` function, not the entire program. The complete program should include the `read_input`, `write_output`, `arrange_students`, and the main section of the code that puts everything together.

Let's rewrite the entire solution with the necessary fixes:

        county_dict[county_id].append(student_id)
    
    sorted_county_keys = sorted(county_dict.keys())

        for i in range(len(sorted_county_keys)):
            idx_current = (idx_start + i) % len(sorted_county_keys)
            county = sorted_county_keys[idx_current]
            if pointers[county] < len(county_dict[county]):

It seems the logic that ensures that no two consecutive students in the output list are from the same county is still not behaving correctly. The issue arises because the output is starting with the first student in the sorted list, regardless of their county, then continues to the next county in the sorted list, potentially causing a repeat if the next county has already been used.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we always start with the smallest available student ID across all counties, and then always continue with the smallest available student ID from a different county. This way, we ensure that we always alternate counties correctly.

Let's rewrite the `arrange_students` function with the correct logic:

```python
def arrange_students(students):
    # Create a dictionary to hold the students from each county
    county_dict = {}
    for county_id, student_id in students:
        if county_id not in county_dict:
            county_dict[county_id] = []
        county_dict[county_id].append(student_id)
    
    # Sort the students within each county
    for county in county_dict:
        county_dict[county].sort()

    # Sort counties based on their IDs
    sorted_county_keys = sorted(county_dict.keys())

    # Initialize the pointers for each county to the first student
    pointers = {county: 0 for county in sorted_county_keys}
    sorted_students = []
    last_county_used = None

    while len(sorted_students) < len(students):
        next_student = None
        next_county = None

        # Find the next student from a different county with the smallest ID
        for county in sorted_county_keys:
            if pointers[county] < len(county_dict[county]) and county != last_county_used:

students = read_input('concurs.in')
arranged_students, sorted_county_keys, county_dict = arrange_students(students)
students_per_county = [len(county_dict[county]) for county in sorted_county_keys]
write_output('concurs.out', len(sorted_county_keys), students_per_county, arranged_students)
```

This revised `arrange_students` function should now correctly intersperse students from different counties while maintaining the increasing order of student IDs. With this fix, the result is expected to match the expected output.
