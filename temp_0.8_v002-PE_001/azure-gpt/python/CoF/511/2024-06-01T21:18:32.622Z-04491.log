Irina și Mihaela sunt surori. Într-o zi, mama lor le aduce $N$ tablete de ciocolată, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, pe care le așează, în această ordine, pe o poliță a unui raft. Pentru fiecare tabletă se cunoaște gramajul (numărul de grame pe care le cântărește). **Cantitatea totală** de ciocolată consumată de o fată este egală cu suma gramajelor tuturor tabletelor consumate de ea. Pentru a consuma ciocolată, fetele trebuie să respecte următoarele reguli:
* cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Irina trebuie să fie mai mare sau egală cu cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de sora sa;
* diferența dintre cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Irina și cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Mihaela trebuie să fie cât mai mică;
* fiecare fată trebuie să consume cel puțin o tabletă de ciocolată;
* fiecare fată consumă tablete de ciocolată de pe raft: Irina începe de la cea numerotată cu $1$ și continuă, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta, iar Mihaela începe cu cea numerotată cu $N$ și continuă, în ordine, de la dreapta la stânga;
* fiecare fată poate întrerupe oricând consumul tabletelor de ciocolată, iar cele rămase fie sunt abandonate pe raft fie sunt consumate de fata cealaltă, dacă ajunge la ele;
* fiecare tabletă de ciocolată fie este consumată complet de una dintre fete, fie rămâne pe raft dar fetele NU pot sări peste nicio tabletă de ciocolată.

# Cerințe
Determinați și afișați:
1. cel mai des întâlnit gramaj în șirul de tablete așezate inițial pe poliță, iar dacă sunt mai multe gramaje care apar de un număr maxim de ori, se alege cel mai mic dintre acestea;
2. diferența minimă dintre cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Irina și cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Mihaela.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `ciocolata.in` se găsește numărul $C$, reprezentând cerința ce trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$), urmat de numărul $N$, cu semnificația din enunț, iar pe a doua linie $N$ numere naturale, reprezentând gramajele celor $N$ tablete de ciocolată, în ordinea numerotării lor. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `ciocolata.out` se va afla un singur număr reprezentând gramajul determinat la cerința $1$ (dacă $C = 1$), respectiv, diferența minimă determinată la cerința $2$ (dacă $C = 2$).

    return most_common_sorted[-1][0]

def solve_task2(chocolates):

    right_sum = total[-1] - total
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(chocolates) - 1):
        diff = abs(total[i] - right_sum[i + 1])

    write_data('ciocolata.out', result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads data from `ciocolata.in`, chooses the correct function to solve the task based on the input, and writes the output to `ciocolata.out`. It optimizes for both time and memory usage, using `numpy` for efficient array manipulation and `collections.Counter` for finding the most common elements. It handles both tasks required in the problem statement.

Please note that, as a knowledge-based AI developed by OpenAI, I can't execute code or create files. The code provided here is for the challenge presented and assumes it is run in an environment with the proper input file `ciocolata.in` existing. You can run this code in your local environment to test its correctness.

The exit code 1 indicates that the program has terminated with an error. The error, as listed in the stderr output, shows that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This means that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the program is being run.

To fix this program, we would need to remove the dependency on `numpy`, as installing additional modules might not be possible or could exceed the memory limit specified in the challenge. We can rewrite the solution using only built-in Python libraries, which should be both memory-efficient and satisfy the time complexity requirements.

Here is the entire solution rewritten without using `numpy`:

```python
from collections import Counter

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return c, chocolates

def write_data(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_task1(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = counter.most_common()
    most_common_sorted = sorted(most_common, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
    return most_common_sorted[0][0]

def solve_task2(chocolates):
    total = [0] * len(chocolates)
    right_sum = [0] * len(chocolates)
    
    # Calculate prefix sum
    total[0] = chocolates[0]
    for i in range(1, len(chocolates)):
        total[i] = total[i - 1] + chocolates[i]
    
    # Calculate suffix sum
    right_sum[-1] = chocolates[-1]
    for i in range(len(chocolates) - 2, -1, -1):
        right_sum[i] = right_sum[i + 1] + chocolates[i]
    
    # Find the minimum difference
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(chocolates) - 1):
        diff = abs(total[i] - right_sum[i + 1])
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    
    return min_diff

def main():
    c, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    if c == 1:
        result = solve_task1(chocolates)
    else:
        result = solve_task2(chocolates)
    write_data('ciocolata.out', result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution follows the same logic as the previous one but uses built-in Python functions and data structures instead of `numpy`. It should work correctly under the memory constraints mentioned in the challenge.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it's clear that there is an issue with how the most common element is being determined in the `solve_task1` function. The problem is that the sorting order is incorrect. The task specifies that if multiple gramages are equally common, we should choose the smallest one. However, the sorting key in the `solve_task1` function is sorting the gramages with an ascending count but descending gramage value, which would instead choose the largest gramage.

To fix this, we need to sort the most common gramages first by the frequency in descending order and then by the gramage itself in ascending order. Here is the corrected `solve_task1` function along with the complete program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return c, chocolates

def write_data(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_task1(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = counter.most_common()
    # Sort by frequency (descending), then by gramage (ascending)
    most_common_sorted = sorted(most_common, key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    return most_common_sorted[0][0]

def solve_task2(chocolates):
    total = [0] * len(chocolates)
    right_sum = [0] * len(chocolates)
    
    # Calculate prefix sum
    total[0] = chocolates[0]
    for i in range(1, len(chocolates)):
        total[i] = total[i - 1] + chocolates[i]
    
    # Calculate suffix sum
    right_sum[-1] = chocolates[-1]
    for i in range(len(chocolates) - 2, -1, -1):
        right_sum[i] = right_sum[i + 1] + chocolates[i]
    
    # Find the minimum difference
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(chocolates) - 1):
        diff = abs(total[i] - right_sum[i + 1])
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    
    return min_diff

def main():
    c, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    if c == 1:
        result = solve_task1(chocolates)
    else:
        result = solve_task2(chocolates)
    write_data('ciocolata.out', result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With this correction, the `solve_task1` function should output the correct result for the given example and any similar cases. It now properly follows the instructions to sort by frequency and then by gramage in the correct order.

The difference in the expected and found result suggests that there is an issue with the `solve_task2` function that calculates the minimum difference between the total amount of chocolate consumed by Irina and Mihaela. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the prefix and suffix sums independently and then tries to find the minimum absolute difference between the two.

The problem is that the algorithm does not account for the shared consumption of chocolates where one sister picks up after the other has stopped. The task implies that the sisters start from opposite ends and may potentially meet in the middle, hence sharing the remaining chocolates.

Here's the correct approach:
1. Calculate the total weight of all chocolates.
2. Iterate over the chocolates from left to right, keeping track of the total weight consumed by Irina.
3. Calculate Mihaela's total by subtracting Irina's total from the overall total weight.
4. Find the point where the absolute difference between the two totals is minimized.

Let’s rewrite the `solve_task2` function with the correct approach:

```python
from collections import Counter

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return c, chocolates

def write_data(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_task1(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = counter.most_common()
    most_common_sorted = sorted(most_common, key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    return most_common_sorted[0][0]

def solve_task2(chocolates):
    total_weight = sum(chocolates)
    irina_total = 0
    min_diff = float('inf')

    # Iterate through chocolates to find the minimum difference
    for weight in chocolates[:-1]:  # Exclude the last chocolate, as Mihaela must have at least one
        irina_total += weight
        mihaela_total = total_weight - irina_total
        min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(irina_total - mihaela_total))

    return min_diff

def main():
    c, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    if c == 1:
        result = solve_task1(chocolates)
    else:
        result = solve_task2(chocolates)
    write_data('ciocolata.out', result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version of `solve_task2` should now output the correct result for the given example and any similar cases, ensuring that both sisters consume at least one chocolate and that the difference in the total weight consumed is minimized.

Upon reviewing the differences between the expected and found result for task 2, it's clear that the algorithm did not find the correct minimum difference. The goal is to minimize the difference between the total chocolate weights consumed by Irina and Mihaela, which also implies that we need to consider the scenario where both consume chocolates until they potentially meet in the middle.

Here's the correct algorithm to solve task 2:

1. We start with two pointers, one at the beginning of the array (Irina's side) and one at the end (Mihaela's side).
2. We keep track of the cumulative weight each sister has eaten.
3. Move the pointers towards each other, at each step adding the weight of the current chocolate to the respective sister's total.
4. At each step, calculate the current difference between the cumulative totals.
5. Continue moving the pointers and updating the totals until the pointers meet or cross.
6. Throughout the process, keep track of the smallest difference encountered.

Let's fix the `solve_task2` function with the correct approach:

```python
def solve_task2(chocolates):
    irina_total = 0
    mihaela_total = sum(chocolates)
    min_diff = float('inf')

    for weight in chocolates:
        irina_total += weight
        mihaela_total -= weight
        if irina_total >= mihaela_total:
            current_diff = irina_total - mihaela_total
            min_diff = min(min_diff, current_diff)
    
    return min_diff

# The rest of the code remains the same as the last provided solution
```

Irina and Mihaela will both start consuming chocolates from their respective ends. We will keep updating the totals until Irina's total is greater than or equal to Mihaela's total. The minimum difference is updated whenever a smaller difference is found.

This solution should now correctly determine the minimum difference between the total amounts of chocolate consumed by Irina and Mihaela and provide the expected output.

My apologies for the confusion. It appears that the previous solution still had an issue that caused the result to not match the expected output for task 2. The solution must ensure that Irina's total is always greater than or equal to Mihaela's total, while also finding the smallest possible difference.

To solve this, we can iterate from both ends towards the center, always adding the chocolate to the total of the girl who currently has less chocolate, and check the difference when their totals are as close as possible but still keeping Irina's total greater than or equal to Mihaela's total.

Here's the entire fixed solution:

```python
def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return c, chocolates

def write_data(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_task1(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = counter.most_common()
    most_common_sorted = sorted(most_common, key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    return most_common_sorted[0][0]

def solve_task2(chocolates):
    irina_total, mihaela_total = 0, 0
    left, right = 0, len(chocolates) - 1
    min_diff = float('inf')

    while left <= right:
        if irina_total <= mihaela_total:
            irina_total += chocolates[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            mihaela_total += chocolates[right]
            right -= 1
        if irina_total >= mihaela_total:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, irina_total - mihaela_total)
    
    return min_diff

def main():
    c, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    if c == 1:
        result = solve_task1(chocolates)
    else:
        result = solve_task2(chocolates)
    write_data('ciocolata.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution reads from `ciocolata.in` and writes the result to `ciocolata.out`. The `solve_task1` function finds the most frequent chocolate weight, whereas the `solve_task2` function calculates the minimum difference between the total chocolate consumed by Irina and Mihaela. The solution ensures that Irina's total consumption is always greater than or equal to Mihaela's, as per the problem constraints.

The `NameError` indicates that `Counter` is not defined. This is because we have not imported `Counter` from the `collections` module. The `stderr` output is pointing out that the `Counter` class is being used in the `solve_task1` function but was not imported. 

Let's fix this issue by adding the missing import for `Counter` and rewriting the entire solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        c, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return c, chocolates

def write_data(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def solve_task1(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = counter.most_common()
    most_common_sorted = sorted(most_common, key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    return most_common_sorted[0][0]

def solve_task2(chocolates):
    irina_total, mihaela_total = 0, 0
    left, right = 0, len(chocolates) - 1
    min_diff = float('inf')

    while left <= right:
        if irina_total <= mihaela_total:
            irina_total += chocolates[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            mihaela_total += chocolates[right]
            right -= 1
        if irina_total >= mihaela_total:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, irina_total - mihaela_total)
    
    return min_diff

def main():
    c, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    if c == 1:
        result = solve_task1(chocolates)
    else:
        result = solve_task2(chocolates)
    write_data('ciocolata.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version includes the necessary import for `Counter`, and the rest of the code remains the same. Now the `solve_task1` function will correctly use the `Counter` class to find the most common chocolate weight, and the `solve_task2` function will calculate the minimum difference in chocolate consumption between Irina and Mihaela. The program reads from `ciocolata.in` and writes the result to `ciocolata.out`.
