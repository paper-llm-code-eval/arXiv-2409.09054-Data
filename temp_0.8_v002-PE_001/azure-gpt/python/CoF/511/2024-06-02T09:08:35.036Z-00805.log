Irina și Mihaela sunt surori. Într-o zi, mama lor le aduce $N$ tablete de ciocolată, numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, pe care le așează, în această ordine, pe o poliță a unui raft. Pentru fiecare tabletă se cunoaște gramajul (numărul de grame pe care le cântărește). **Cantitatea totală** de ciocolată consumată de o fată este egală cu suma gramajelor tuturor tabletelor consumate de ea. Pentru a consuma ciocolată, fetele trebuie să respecte următoarele reguli:
* cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Irina trebuie să fie mai mare sau egală cu cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de sora sa;
* diferența dintre cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Irina și cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Mihaela trebuie să fie cât mai mică;
* fiecare fată trebuie să consume cel puțin o tabletă de ciocolată;
* fiecare fată consumă tablete de ciocolată de pe raft: Irina începe de la cea numerotată cu $1$ și continuă, în ordine, de la stânga la dreapta, iar Mihaela începe cu cea numerotată cu $N$ și continuă, în ordine, de la dreapta la stânga;
* fiecare fată poate întrerupe oricând consumul tabletelor de ciocolată, iar cele rămase fie sunt abandonate pe raft fie sunt consumate de fata cealaltă, dacă ajunge la ele;
* fiecare tabletă de ciocolată fie este consumată complet de una dintre fete, fie rămâne pe raft dar fetele NU pot sări peste nicio tabletă de ciocolată.

# Cerințe
Determinați și afișați:
1. cel mai des întâlnit gramaj în șirul de tablete așezate inițial pe poliță, iar dacă sunt mai multe gramaje care apar de un număr maxim de ori, se alege cel mai mic dintre acestea;
2. diferența minimă dintre cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Irina și cantitatea totală de ciocolată consumată de Mihaela.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie din fișierul `ciocolata.in` se găsește numărul $C$, reprezentând cerința ce trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$), urmat de numărul $N$, cu semnificația din enunț, iar pe a doua linie $N$ numere naturale, reprezentând gramajele celor $N$ tablete de ciocolată, în ordinea numerotării lor. Numerele aflate pe aceeași linie a fișierului sunt separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` indicates that the numpy library is not installed in the current Python environment where the script is being executed. In this programming challenge, we are required to optimize for both time and memory, and numpy is typically used for such optimizations due to its efficiency with large arrays and numerical computations.

However, given the constraints of the environment, which does not have numpy installed, and considering the memory limit, we can provide an alternative solution that does not rely on numpy or any external libraries. We will use built-in Python data structures and functions to solve the problem, ensuring that it fits within the memory limit. Here is the rewritten solution:

```python
# ciocolata.py

from collections import Counter

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        task, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return task, chocolates

def most_common_weight(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = min(weight for weight, count in counter.items() if count == max(counter.values()))
    return most_common

def minimum_difference(chocolates):
    total_weight = sum(chocolates)
    prefix_sums = [0]
    for weight in chocolates:
        prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + weight)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(prefix_sums)):
        irina_weight = prefix_sums[i]
        mihaela_weight = total_weight - irina_weight
        diff = abs(irina_weight - mihaela_weight)
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    return min_diff

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def main():
    task, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    result = None
    if task == 1:
        result = most_common_weight(chocolates)
    elif task == 2:

The incorrect output suggests that there is a flaw in the algorithm used to calculate the minimum difference between the total chocolate weights consumed by Irina and Mihaela. Let's review the code and the logic used to calculate this difference.

The current approach calculates the prefix sums of the chocolates array, representing the total weight consumed by Irina if she stops at each possible point. Then, it calculates the difference between Irina's weight and Mihaela's weight at each point, looking for the smallest difference.

However, the error lies in not ensuring that Mihaela also gets at least one chocolate, as required by the problem statement. The current code does not guarantee that Mihaela will consume at least one chocolate since it allows Irina to consume all chocolates.

Let's correct the algorithm by ensuring that Mihaela also gets at least one chocolate and that we only consider valid splitting points where both girls get some of the chocolates.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# ciocolata.py

from collections import Counter

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        task, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return task, chocolates

def most_common_weight(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = min(weight for weight, count in counter.items() if count == max(counter.values()))
    return most_common

def minimum_difference(chocolates):
    total_weight = sum(chocolates)
    min_diff = total_weight
    irina_weight = 0
    for i in range(len(chocolates) - 1):  # Ensure Mihaela gets at least one chocolate
        irina_weight += chocolates[i]
        mihaela_weight = total_weight - irina_weight
        diff = abs(irina_weight - mihaela_weight)
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    return min_diff

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def main():
    task, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    result = None
    if task == 1:
        result = most_common_weight(chocolates)
    elif task == 2:
        result = minimum_difference(chocolates)
    write_output('ciocolata.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised version of the `minimum_difference` function iterates only up to `len(chocolates) - 1` to ensure Irina does not consume the last chocolate, leaving at least one for Mihaela. This should fix the issue and produce the correct minimum difference.

Upon reviewing the logic, it becomes clear that the current implementation does not find the optimal splitting point that minimizes the difference between the total chocolate weights consumed by Irina and Mihaela. Instead, it calculates the differences based on a single pointer moving from the start to the end, which doesn't guarantee that the difference will be minimized as it should consider both girls moving towards each other.

To correct the algorithm, we will implement a two-pointer approach. Irina starts from the beginning of the chocolate array and Mihaela starts from the end. We will move the pointers towards each other to adjust the total weights consumed by each, looking for the minimum possible difference where both Irina and Mihaela consume at least one chocolate.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# ciocolata.py

from collections import Counter

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        task, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return task, chocolates

def most_common_weight(chocolates):
    counter = Counter(chocolates)
    most_common = min(weight for weight, count in counter.items() if count == max(counter.values()))
    return most_common

def minimum_difference(chocolates):
    irina_weight = chocolates[0]
    mihaela_weight = sum(chocolates[1:])  # Initialize Mihaela's weight excluding the first chocolate for Irina
    min_diff = abs(irina_weight - mihaela_weight)
    
    for i in range(1, len(chocolates) - 1):  # Ensure both girls get at least one chocolate
        irina_weight += chocolates[i]
        mihaela_weight -= chocolates[i]
        diff = abs(irina_weight - mihaela_weight)
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    
    return min_diff

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def main():
    task, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    result = None
    if task == 1:
        result = most_common_weight(chocolates)
    elif task == 2:
        result = minimum_difference(chocolates)
    write_output('ciocolata.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this updated version, we calculate `mihaela_weight` as the sum of all chocolates except the first one, so we start with a situation where Irina has one chocolate and Mihaela has the rest. We then iterate over the remaining chocolates, moving the boundary between Irina and Mihaela's shares one chocolate at a time and updating the minimum difference accordingly. This ensures that we consider every possible way to split the chocolates while maintaining both constraints that each girl must consume at least one tablet and the difference in the total weight consumed by each is minimized.

The expected output indicates that the difference in the total chocolate weight consumed by Irina and Mihaela should be `3`. However, the program outputs `18`, which indicates that the current implementation is not correctly finding the optimal splitting point between the chocolates consumed by the two girls.

To correct this, we need a different approach to find the minimum difference. We will utilize a sliding window technique to manage the distribution of chocolates between Irina and Mihaela. We can simulate the process by maintaining a balance and adjusting this balance as we move the dividing point from left to right, always ensuring that the balance is non-negative (Irina should not consume less than Mihaela) and that the difference is minimized.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# ciocolata.py

def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        task, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return task, chocolates

def most_common_weight(chocolates):
    counter = {}
    for weight in chocolates:
        counter[weight] = counter.get(weight, 0) + 1
    most_common = min([weight for weight, count in counter.items() if count == max(counter.values())])
    return most_common

def minimum_difference(chocolates):
    irina_total = 0
    mihaela_total = sum(chocolates)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for weight in chocolates[:-1]:  # Exclude the last chocolate to ensure Mihaela gets at least one
        irina_total += weight
        mihaela_total -= weight
        # Since Irina must have at least as much as Mihaela, we only check when Irina's total is greater or equal
        if irina_total >= mihaela_total:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, irina_total - mihaela_total)
    return min_diff

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def main():
    task, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    result = None
    if task == 1:
        result = most_common_weight(chocolates)
    elif task == 2:
        result = minimum_difference(chocolates)
    write_output('ciocolata.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation of `minimum_difference` ensures that the dividing point always leaves at least one chocolate for Mihaela (by iterating up to `chocolates[:-1]`). It also checks that Irina's total is at least as much as Mihaela's before considering updating the `min_diff`. This should correctly find the minimum difference.

The expected result indicates that the minimum difference in the total weight of chocolates consumed by Irina and Mihaela should be `3`. The incorrect output suggests that the algorithm is not correctly finding the optimal split point where the difference is minimized.

The approach in the previous implementation is not correctly considering the scenario where the two sisters meet in the middle and the remaining chocolates are not consumed by either.

To address this, we need to implement an approach that finds the point where the difference between the chocolates consumed by Irina (starting from the beginning) and Mihaela (starting from the end) is minimized. This can be done by iterating from both ends towards the middle and keeping track of the current difference.

Here is the corrected solution with the right algorithm:

```python
def read_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        task, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        chocolates = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return task, chocolates

def most_common_weight(chocolates):
    counter = {}
    max_count = 0
    min_weight = float('inf')
    for weight in chocolates:
        counter[weight] = counter.get(weight, 0) + 1
        if counter[weight] > max_count or (counter[weight] == max_count and weight < min_weight):
            max_count = counter[weight]
            min_weight = weight
    return min_weight

def minimum_difference(chocolates):
    left_sum = 0
    right_sum = sum(chocolates)
    min_diff = abs(right_sum - left_sum)
    for weight in chocolates:
        left_sum += weight
        right_sum -= weight
        if left_sum >= right_sum:
            diff1 = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
            diff2 = abs(left_sum - weight - (right_sum + weight))
            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff1, diff2)
    return min_diff

def write_output(filename, result):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')

def main():
    task, chocolates = read_data('ciocolata.in')
    result = None
    if task == 1:
        result = most_common_weight(chocolates)
    elif task == 2:
        result = minimum_difference(chocolates)
    write_output('ciocolata.out', result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this implementation, we iterate over each chocolate, adding its weight to `left_sum` and subtracting from `right_sum`. At each step, we calculate two potential differences: one assuming the current chocolate is consumed by Irina (`diff1`), and another assuming the current chocolate is consumed by Mihaela (`diff2`). We then take the minimum of these differences and update `min_diff` accordingly. This approach will ensure we find the optimal split point where Irina starts consuming from the left and Mihaela starts from the right, and neither skips any chocolates.
