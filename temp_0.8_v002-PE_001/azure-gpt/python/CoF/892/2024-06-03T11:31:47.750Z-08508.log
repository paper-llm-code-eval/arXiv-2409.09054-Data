Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.

import numpy as np

# Read input data

    h = np.array(file.readline().split(), dtype=np.int64)
    q = int(file.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]

# Create the prefix sum array
prefix_sum = np.zeros(n + 1, dtype=np.int64)
np.cumsum(h, out=prefix_sum[1:])

# Function to calculate the sum of a submatrix
def calculate_sum(a, b, c, d):
    # Sum of the full columns in the range [a, c]
    full_column_sum = prefix_sum[c] - prefix_sum[a - 1]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete bottom part
    # Find first column that extends beyond b
    first_full_column = np.searchsorted(h, b)
    # Count how many elements need to be subtracted
    elements_to_subtract = np.sum(h[a - 1:first_full_column] - b + 1)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete top part
    # Find first column that does not extend to d
    first_not_full_column = np.searchsorted(h, d, side='right')
    # Count how many elements need to be subtracted
    elements_to_subtract += np.sum(d - h[first_not_full_column:c])

    return full_column_sum - elements_to_subtract

# Write output data
with open('tnia.out', 'w') as file:
    for a, b, c, d in queries:
        file.write(f"{calculate_sum(a, b, c, d)}\n")
```

This code will solve the problem while optimizing for both time and memory usage, using NumPy arrays and efficient search algorithms. The prefix sum array is used to quickly calculate the full column sum, and the searchsorted function from NumPy is used to find the indices where the partial sums need to be adjusted. The input and output operations are performed with file reading and writing to meet the requirements of the challenge.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found. Since the challenge specifies optimizing for time and memory and encourages the use of highly efficient libraries like `numpy`, it's possible that the environment where this code is being executed does not have `numpy` installed.

However, in a coding challenge or a restricted environment, it may be required to avoid using external libraries like `numpy`. Therefore, I will rewrite the solution using only built-in Python libraries, ensuring that it does not rely on `numpy` or any other external modules.

Here is the updated solution, which uses list comprehensions and python's built-in functions to accomplish the task:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tnia.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    h = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    q = int(file.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]

# Create the prefix sum array
prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + h[i - 1]

# Function to calculate the sum of a submatrix
def calculate_sum(a, b, c, d):
    # Sum of the full columns in the range [a, c]
    full_column_sum = prefix_sum[c] - prefix_sum[a - 1]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete bottom part
    first_full_column = next((i for i, height in enumerate(h, start=1) if height >= b), n)
    elements_to_subtract = sum(max(0, height - b + 1) for height in h[a - 1:first_full_column])
    
    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete top part
    first_not_full_column = next((i for i, height in enumerate(h[first_full_column - 1:], start=first_full_column) if height > d), c)
    elements_to_subtract += sum(max(0, d - height) for height in h[first_not_full_column:c])

    return full_column_sum - elements_to_subtract

# Write output data
with open('tnia.out', 'w') as file:
    for a, b, c, d in queries:
        file.write(f"{calculate_sum(a, b, c, d)}\n")
```

I replaced the functionality provided by `numpy` with Python's built-in functions and list comprehensions. This should work efficiently while complying with the memory limit and without relying on external libraries.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates that there is a bug in the logic for calculating the sum of elements in the submatrices. Specifically, it appears that the code is not handling the boundaries for incomplete bottom and top parts of the columns correctly. The code should ensure that when it is subtracting the elements for incomplete columns, it only does so for columns within the range `[a, c]` and for rows within the range `[b, d]`.

Let's correct the logic. The previous implementation did not filter out columns which are outside the query range `[a, c]` and also didn't consider the case where the top of the submatrix is below the height of the first column within the range, leading to incorrect calculations.

Here's the corrected implementation using pure Python:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tnia.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    h = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    q = int(file.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]

# Create the prefix sum array
prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + h[i - 1]

# Function to calculate the sum of a submatrix
def calculate_sum(a, b, c, d):
    # Sum of the full columns in the range [a, c]
    full_column_sum = prefix_sum[c] - prefix_sum[a - 1]

    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete bottom part
    bottom_subtract = 0
    for col in range(a - 1, c):
        if h[col] < b:
            continue
        bottom_subtract += min(h[col], b - 1)

    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete top part
    top_subtract = 0
    for col in range(a - 1, c):
        if h[col] <= d:
            continue
        top_subtract += h[col] - d

    return full_column_sum - bottom_subtract - top_subtract

# Write output data
with open('tnia.out', 'w') as file:
    for a, b, c, d in queries:
        file.write(f"{calculate_sum(a, b, c, d)}\n")
```

This implementation fixes the logic used to compute the elements to subtract from the full column sum. It iterates over the columns within the range `[a, c]` and properly accumulates the number of elements to subtract based on whether the height of each column is between `[b, d]`. This should now give the correct results for all the test cases.

Upon reviewing the latest implementation, I've identified that the discrepancies still exist due to incorrect calculations of the incomplete columns. Specifically, the bottom subtract and top subtract calculations are incorrect. In the bottom subtract part, we should only subtract the elements if column height is greater than or equal to `b`, not less than `b`. Plus, we should subtract `b - 1` from `h[col]` if `h[col] >= b`.

For the top subtract part, we should not subtract anything if the column height is less than or equal to `d` (not greater than `d`). If `h[col] > d`, we subtract the difference between `h[col]` and `d`.

Let's correct this logic and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tnia.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    h = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    q = int(file.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]

# Create the prefix sum array
prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + h[i - 1]

# Function to calculate the sum of a submatrix
def calculate_sum(a, b, c, d):
    # Sum of the full columns in the range [a, c]
    full_column_sum = prefix_sum[c] - prefix_sum[a - 1]

    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete bottom part if any
    bottom_subtract = 0
    for col in range(a - 1, c):
        if h[col] < b:
            continue
        # Subtract the non-filled cells from the bottom part of the column
        bottom_subtract += b - 1

    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete top part if any
    top_subtract = 0
    for col in range(a - 1, c):
        if h[col] > d:
            # Subtract the non-filled cells from the top part of the column
            top_subtract += h[col] - d

    return full_column_sum - bottom_subtract - top_subtract

# Write output data
with open('tnia.out', 'w') as file:
    for a, b, c, d in queries:
        file.write(f"{calculate_sum(a, b, c, d)}\n")
```

This corrected implementation now accurately computes the number of elements to subtract for both the bottom and top parts of the columns within the specified ranges. It should yield the correct results consistent with the expected output for all test cases.

I apologize for the oversight. It appears that the logic used to determine the incomplete bottom and top parts needs further adjustment. Specifically, the bottom subtraction should be the number of elements below `b` that are within the height of the column. For the top subtraction, we must subtract the number of elements above `d` that are within the height of the column and within the query range.

Let's correct the logic once more:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tnia.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    h = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    q = int(file.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]

# Create the prefix sum array
prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + h[i - 1]

# Function to calculate the sum of a submatrix
def calculate_sum(a, b, c, d):
    # Sum of the full columns in the range [a, c]
    full_column_sum = prefix_sum[c] - prefix_sum[a - 1]

    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete bottom part if any
    bottom_subtract = 0
    for col in range(a - 1, min(c, len(h))):
        if h[col] >= b:
            bottom_subtract += (h[col] + 1) - max(b, 1)  # Correct the bottom subtraction logic

    # Calculate the sum of the incomplete top part if any
    top_subtract = 0
    for col in range(a - 1, min(c, len(h))):
        if h[col] > d:
            top_subtract += h[col] - d

    return full_column_sum - bottom_subtract - top_subtract

# Write output data
with open('tnia.out', 'w') as file:
    for a, b, c, d in queries:
        # Correct the query bounds
        submatrix_sum = calculate_sum(a, b, c, d)
        file.write(f"{submatrix_sum}\n")
```

The above correction should now properly account for the subtracted elements from the full column sum. The bottom and top subtractions are calculated using the corrected logic, which only subtracts the elements below `b` and above `d`, as specified in the queries. The `max(b, 1)` part ensures that we don't subtract more than the actual filled elements when `b` is 1. This solution should now produce the expected output.

I apologize for the continued issues. The logic for calculating the incomplete parts of the columns during the subtraction phase is still incorrect. The approach for the bottom subtraction should subtract cells for each column where the column height (`h[col]`) exceeds `b-1` (i.e., it includes `b`), and the top subtraction should subtract cells for each column where the column height exceeds `d`.

Let's correct the solution once more, and provide a clearer implementation:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tnia.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    h = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    q = int(file.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]

# Create a prefix sum array for heights to enable quick sum calculations
prefix_heights = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    prefix_heights[i] = prefix_heights[i - 1] + h[i - 1]

# Function to calculate the sum of a submatrix
def calculate_sum(a, b, c, d):
    sum_full_cols = prefix_heights[c] - prefix_heights[a - 1]  # sum of full columns
    
    bottom_subtract = 0
    top_subtract = 0
    for col in range(a - 1, c):
        if h[col] < b:  # If the column height is less than the bottom line, skip it
            continue
        bottom_subtract += b - 1  # Subtract the part below the bottom line (inclusive)
        
        if h[col] > d:  # If the column height is above the top line
            top_subtract += h[col] - d  # Subtract the part above the top line (exclusive)

    return sum_full_cols - bottom_subtract - top_subtract

# Write output data
with open('tnia.out', 'w') as file:
    for a, b, c, d in queries:
        result = calculate_sum(a, b, c, d)
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly handle the bottom and top subtractions. It considers only the relevant columns within the query range `[a, c]` and subtracts only the cells that are within the height bounds `[b, d]`. The expected output should now match the output of this corrected implementation.

Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the approach to calculate the sum of elements in the submatrix for the given queries. The initial logic for handling the subtraction of elements for the incomplete bottom and top parts is incorrect.

We need to calculate the sum of elements in a submatrix by first determining the full sum of the columns in the range [A, C]. Since the heights h_i are given in ascending order, we know that any height h_i is at least as large as all heights h_1 through h_(i-1). We can use this property to optimize the sum calculation for each query.

For each query, we need to add the heights of the columns from A to C, then subtract any parts of these columns that fall outside the range specified by B and D.

Here's the revised and correct solution:

```python
# Read input data
with open('tnia.in', 'r') as file:
    n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
    heights = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    q = int(file.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]

# Function to calculate the sum of a submatrix
def calculate_sum(A, B, C, D):
    sum_elements = 0
    for col in range(A - 1, C):
        # Calculate the number of 1s in the current column within the query limits
        column_sum = min(heights[col], D) - B + 1 if B <= heights[col] else 0
        sum_elements += max(0, column_sum)
    return sum_elements

# Write output data
with open('tnia.out', 'w') as file:
    for A, B, C, D in queries:
        file.write(f"{calculate_sum(A, B, C, D)}\n")
```

This solution iterates over each column in the range [A, C], and for each column, it calculates how many 1s are within the B-D range (taking into account that heights are 1-indexed). It sums these up to get the submatrix sum. This approach avoids the need for prefix sums and should work for all cases, including the provided examples, while respecting the memory constraint.
