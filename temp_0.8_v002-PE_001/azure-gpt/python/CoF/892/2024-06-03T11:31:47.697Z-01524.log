```

This solution uses numpy for efficient array operations and memory usage. The key to solving the problem is calculating prefix sums for the columns, which allows us to answer each query in O(C - A + 1) time, which is much more efficient than a naive solution. This program is designed to use minimal memory, only storing the necessary arrays of heights and prefix sums, and thus should not exceed the memory limit of ~8MB for the given constraints.

Based on the error message, it seems that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the challenge specifies optimizing both time and memory usage and encourages the use of highly efficient libraries like `numpy`, the lack of this module is problematic.

However, as we're limited by an environment where `numpy` is not available and we need to optimize for memory usage, we will have to implement a solution that does not rely on external libraries like `numpy`. We can use basic Python data structures like lists and perform the necessary calculations manually. Here's a revised solution without using `numpy`:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        heights = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        q = int(file.readline())
        queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    return n, m, heights, q, queries

def write_output(filename, answers):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        for answer in answers:
            file.write(f"{answer}\n")

def calculate_sum(n, m, heights, q, queries):
    # We will use prefix sums to calculate the sums efficiently
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + heights[i - 1]

    answers = []
    for A, B, C, D in queries:
        sum_region = 0
        A -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        C -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        sum_region += prefix_sums[C + 1] - prefix_sums[A]
        sum_region -= max(0, B - 1) * (C - A + 1)
        for i in range(A, C + 1):
            if heights[i] < B:
                sum_region -= B - 1 - heights[i]
        answers.append(sum_region)
    return answers

def main():
    n, m, heights, q, queries = read_input('tnia.in')
    answers = calculate_sum(n, m, heights, q, queries)
    write_output('tnia.out', answers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code should work in an environment without `numpy` and other third-party libraries. It still utilizes the idea of prefix sums to answer queries efficiently and is careful with memory usage by not storing any unnecessary data.

The difference between the expected and found output indicates that there is an error in the logic of the `calculate_sum` function, particularly in the loop where we adjust the sum for the heights lower than B. For columns with heights lower than B, we are subtracting too many ones. Specifically, we are subtracting `(B - 1) - heights[i]`, which is incorrect because we should subtract `B - heights[i] - 1` for each column with height less than B.

Let's fix the bug in the `calculate_sum` function:

```python
def calculate_sum(n, m, heights, q, queries):
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + heights[i - 1]

    answers = []
    for A, B, C, D in queries:
        A -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        C -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        sum_region = prefix_sums[C + 1] - prefix_sums[A]  # Total 1's in the columns from A to C

        # Subtract 1's that are below row B for each column
        for i in range(A, C + 1):
            if heights[i] < B:
                sum_region -= (B - heights[i] - 1)
        
        # If D is less than the height of a column, only count 1's up to row D
        for i in range(A, C + 1):
            if heights[i] > D:
                sum_region -= (heights[i] - D)

        answers.append(sum_region)
    
    return answers

# Rest of the code remains the same
```

The corrected `calculate_sum` function now properly subtracts the number of 1's that are below row B and above row D. This should produce the correct results. Let's re-run the complete solution with this corrected function:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        heights = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        q = int(file.readline())
        queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    return n, m, heights, q, queries

def write_output(filename, answers):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        for answer in answers:
            file.write(f"{answer}\n")

def main():
    n, m, heights, q, queries = read_input('tnia.in')
    answers = calculate_sum(n, m, heights, q, queries)
    write_output('tnia.out', answers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With this fix, the program should now produce the correct output for all given queries.

Certainly, here is the revised solution that reads from `tnia.in` and writes to `tnia.out`. It includes the necessary fixes to the `calculate_sum` function as previously discussed:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        heights = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        q = int(file.readline())
        queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    return n, m, heights, q, queries

def write_output(filename, answers):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        for answer in answers:
            file.write(f"{answer}\n")

def calculate_sum(n, m, heights, q, queries):
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + heights[i - 1]

    answers = []
    for A, B, C, D in queries:
        A -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        C -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        sum_region = prefix_sums[C + 1] - prefix_sums[A]  # Total 1's in the columns from A to C

        # Subtract 1's that are below row B for each column
        for i in range(A, C + 1):
            if heights[i] < B:
                sum_region -= (B - heights[i] - 1)
        
        # If D is less than the height of a column, only count 1's up to row D
        for i in range(A, C + 1):
            if heights[i] > D:
                sum_region -= (heights[i] - D)

        answers.append(sum_region)
    
    return answers

def main():
    n, m, heights, q, queries = read_input('tnia.in')
    answers = calculate_sum(n, m, heights, q, queries)
    write_output('tnia.out', answers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program reads the input data from `tnia.in`, processes the queries, and writes the results to `tnia.out`. The `calculate_sum` function is fixed to correctly calculate the sum of 1's in the specified submatrix and uses 0-based indexing to handle the queries. The `write_output` function ensures that the results are written to a file instead of being printed to the console.

My apologies for the oversight. Clearly, the solution has a logical error in handling the subtraction of ones from the sum in the `calculate_sum` function. Specifically, the adjustments for the heights below B and above D are not correctly calculated. Here's the correct logic:

- For each column in the range [A, C], if the height of the column is greater than or equal to B, we should consider the height up to the minimum of `D` and `height[i]`.
- If the height of the column is less than B, then there are no ones to consider in that column for this query.

Let's rewrite the `calculate_sum` function with the correct logic:

```python
def calculate_sum(n, m, heights, queries):
    answers = []
    for A, B, C, D in queries:
        total_sum = 0
        for column in range(A, C + 1):
            if heights[column - 1] >= B:  # Check if column height is greater than or equal to B
                # We only consider the height up to D for the sum, and up to B at minimum
                total_sum += min(heights[column - 1], D) - B + 1
        answers.append(total_sum)
    return answers

def main():
    n, m, heights, q, queries = read_input('tnia.in')
    answers = calculate_sum(n, m, heights, queries)
    write_output('tnia.out', answers)

main()
```

This revised function should now produce the correct output. It calculates the sum for each query by considering only the ones that are within the query bounds. The rest of the code remains the same, as it reads input from 'tnia.in' and writes output to 'tnia.out'.

The error message indicates that the function `read_input` is not defined when attempting to call it within the `main` function. It seems that I accidentally omitted the definition of `read_input` and other functions in the final solution. Let's correct this by including all necessary functions and fixing the logic in `calculate_sum` as well.

Here is the complete and revised solution:

```python
def read_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        n, m = map(int, file.readline().split())
        heights = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
        q = int(file.readline())
        queries = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    return n, m, heights, q, queries

def write_output(filename, answers):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        for answer in answers:
            file.write(f"{answer}\n")

def calculate_sum(n, m, heights, queries):
    answers = []
    for A, B, C, D in queries:
        total_sum = 0
        for column in range(A, C + 1):
            column_height = heights[column - 1]
            if column_height >= B:
                # Add to total_sum the count of 1's between B and min(D, column_height)
                total_sum += min(column_height, D) - B + 1
        answers.append(total_sum)
    return answers

def main():
    n, m, heights, q, queries = read_input('tnia.in')
    answers = calculate_sum(n, m, heights, queries)
    write_output('tnia.out', answers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution includes the `read_input` and `write_output` function definitions, which were missing in the previous snippet. The `calculate_sum` function now correctly computes the total sum of 1's within the specified submatrix for each query. This program should read the input from `tnia.in`, process the input correctly, and write the output to `tnia.out` without any errors.
