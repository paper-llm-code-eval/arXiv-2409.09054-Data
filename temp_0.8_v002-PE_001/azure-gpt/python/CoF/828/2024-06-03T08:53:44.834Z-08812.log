Pasiunea Mirunei este să coloreze. Vacanţa trecută şi-a petrecut-o la bunica ei la ţară şi pentru că se cam plictisea s-a gândit să vopsească gardul de la casa bunicii.

Gardul este compus din $N$ scânduri dispuse una lângă alta. Miruna a găsit în garajul bunicii $5$ cutii de vopsea de culori diferite: **albă**, **albastră**, **roşie**, **verde** şi **galbenă**. Când a vopsit gardul, Miruna a respectat următoarele reguli:
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **alb**, următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **albastru**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **albastru**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **alb** sau **roşu**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **roşu**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **albastru** sau **verde**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **verde**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **roșu** sau **galben**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **galben**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **verde**

După ce a și-a terminat treaba Miruna își admira “opera de artă” și se întreba în câte moduri diferite ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii.

Certainly! Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import numpy as np

def multiply_matrices_mod(a, b, mod):
    result = np.zeros_like(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        for j in range(len(b[0])):
            for k in range(len(b)):
                result[i][j] = (result[i][j] + a[i][k] * b[k][j]) % mod
    return result

def matrix_power_mod(matrix, power, mod):
    result = np.identity(len(matrix), dtype=np.uint64)
    while power:
        if power % 2:
            result = multiply_matrices_mod(result, matrix, mod)
        matrix = multiply_matrices_mod(matrix, matrix, mod)
        power //= 2
    return result

def count_ways(N):
    transition_matrix = np.array([
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    ], dtype=np.uint64)

    if N == 1:
        return 5
    else:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        transition_matrix_power = matrix_power_mod(transition_matrix, N - 1, mod)
        result = sum(transition_matrix_power[0]) % mod
        return result

# Read N from file
with open('culori.in', 'r') as input_file:

# Calculate the result
result = count_ways(N)

# Write the result to file
with open('culori.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(str(result))
```

This solution reads from `culori.in` and writes the computed number of ways to `culori.out`, without using `input()` or `print()`. It also optimizes for both time and memory by using numpy for matrix operations and calculates large powers of the matrix using exponentiation by squaring, keeping memory usage within the specified limit.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since we must adhere to the memory constraint and avoid using external libraries like `numpy`, we will need to use standard Python constructs to solve the problem. Here's the Python solution without using `numpy`:

The issue with the previous implementation seems to be in the matrix multiplication and matrix exponentiation functions. The matrix multiplication didn't handle the modulo operation correctly for each element, and the overall logic of matrix exponentiation requires careful implementation.

Let's fix the solution by correctly implementing matrix multiplication and exponentiation with the modulo operation:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to multiply two matrices with modulo
def matrix_multiply_mod(a, b, mod=MOD):
    result = [[sum(x * y % mod for x, y in zip(row, col)) % mod for col in zip(*b)] for row in a]
    return result

# Function to raise a matrix to a power with modulo
def matrix_power_mod(matrix, power, mod=MOD):
    result = [[1 if i == j else 0 for j in range(len(matrix))] for i in range(len(matrix))]
    while power > 0:
        if power % 2:
            result = matrix_multiply_mod(result, matrix, mod)
        matrix = matrix_multiply_mod(matrix, matrix, mod)
        power //= 2
    return result

# Function to count the number of ways to paint the fence
def count_ways(N):
    transition_matrix = [
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # From white to blue
        [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # From blue to white or red
        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # From red to blue or green
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],  # From green to red or yellow
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]   # From yellow to green
    ]

    # The base case, when N = 1, all colors are possible
    if N == 1:
        return 5

    # Raise the transition matrix to the (N - 1)th power
    tm_power = matrix_power_mod(transition_matrix, N - 1)

    # Sum the elements in the first row of the transition matrix^(N-1)
    return sum(tm_power[0]) % MOD

# Read N from file
with open('culori.in', 'r') as input_file:
    N = int(input_file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the result
result = count_ways(N)

# Write the result to file
with open('culori.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(str(result))
```

This implementation fixes the issue with modulo operations in matrix multiplication and ensures the matrix exponentiation is correctly utilizing the power of 2's for efficient calculation. It should now produce the correct result of 24 for the given input of `4`.

It appears that the implementation of matrix multiplication and exponentiation still contains errors. Let's revisit the code and provide a correct implementation for the matrix operations ensuring proper modulo arithmetic. We need to be careful when multiplying matrices to make sure the result of each element is correctly computed under the modulo.

Here's the correct implementation:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to multiply two matrices under modulo
def matrix_multiply(a, b):
    size = len(a)
    res = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            for k in range(size):
                res[i][j] = (res[i][j] + a[i][k] * b[k][j]) % MOD
    return res

# Function to raise a matrix to a power under modulo
def matrix_power(matrix, power):
    size = len(matrix)
    res = [[1 if i == j else 0 for i in range(size)] for j in range(size)]
    while power > 0:
        if power % 2 == 1:
            res = matrix_multiply(res, matrix)
        matrix = matrix_multiply(matrix, matrix)
        power //= 2
    return res

def count_ways(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 5  # There are 5 ways to paint one plank with each color.

    # Transition matrix representing the rules of painting
    transition_matrix = [
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # From white to blue
        [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # From blue to white or red
        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # From red to blue or green
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],  # From green to red or yellow
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]   # From yellow to green
    ]

    # The matrix is raised to the power of (N - 1) because we start with all 5 colors.
    matrix_n_minus_1 = matrix_power(transition_matrix, N - 1)

    # The number of ways to paint the fence is the sum of ways to end with any color.
    return sum(matrix_n_minus_1[0]) % MOD

# Read N from the input file.
with open('culori.in') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Write the number of ways to the output file.
with open('culori.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(count_ways(N)))
```

This code fixes the matrix multiplication and exponentiation functions to ensure that operations are performed under the modulo. The function count_ways calculates the number of ways to paint the fence by raising the transition matrix to the (N - 1) power and summing the first row, which represents starting with a white plank. This should provide the correct answer for any input N within the given constraints.

The discrepancy in the expected and found results suggests there is a logical error in the solution. Upon closer inspection, it seems the error is in how we sum the ways to paint the fence after computing the power of the transition matrix. The sum should not only consider the first row but all elements of the resulting matrix since any color can be the starting point for the first board.

Here is the correct solution that addresses this issue:

```python
# Function to multiply two matrices under modulo arithmetic
def matrix_multiply_mod(a, b, mod):
    size = len(a)
    result = [[0 for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            for k in range(size):
                result[i][j] = (result[i][j] + a[i][k] * b[k][j]) % mod
    return result

# Function to raise a matrix to a power under modulo arithmetic
def matrix_power_mod(matrix, power, mod):
    size = len(matrix)
    result = [[1 if i == j else 0 for j in range(size)] for i in range(size)]
    while power:
        if power & 1:
            result = matrix_multiply_mod(result, matrix, mod)
        matrix = matrix_multiply_mod(matrix, matrix, mod)
        power >>= 1
    return result

# Function to count the number of ways to paint the fence
def count_ways(N, mod):
    # Transition matrix based on the problem statement
    transition_matrix = [
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # From white to blue
        [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # From blue to white or red
        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # From red to blue or green
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],  # From green to red or yellow
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]   # From yellow to green
    ]

    # Base case
    if N == 1:
        return 5

    # Compute the (N - 1)th power of the transition matrix
    matrix_pow = matrix_power_mod(transition_matrix, N - 1, mod)

    # The total number of ways to paint the fence is the sum of the
    # elements in the resulting matrix after raising to the (N - 1)th power
    # since all colors can be the starting color.
    total_ways = 0
    for row in matrix_pow:
        total_ways += sum(row)
    return total_ways % mod

# Read N from file
with open('culori.in', 'r') as input_file:
    N = int(input_file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the result
MOD = 10**9 + 7
result = count_ways(N, MOD)

# Write the result to file
with open('culori.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(str(result))
```

This should now correctly compute the total number of ways to paint the fence by considering all colors as starting points and then summing all the ways to end on any color for the last board. The result for N=4 should match the expected output of 24.
