Pasiunea Mirunei este să coloreze. Vacanţa trecută şi-a petrecut-o la bunica ei la ţară şi pentru că se cam plictisea s-a gândit să vopsească gardul de la casa bunicii.

Gardul este compus din $N$ scânduri dispuse una lângă alta. Miruna a găsit în garajul bunicii $5$ cutii de vopsea de culori diferite: **albă**, **albastră**, **roşie**, **verde** şi **galbenă**. Când a vopsit gardul, Miruna a respectat următoarele reguli:
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **alb**, următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **albastru**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **albastru**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **alb** sau **roşu**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **roşu**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **albastru** sau **verde**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **verde**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **roșu** sau **galben**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **galben**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **verde**

După ce a și-a terminat treaba Miruna își admira “opera de artă” și se întreba în câte moduri diferite ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii. 

# Cerinţă

Ajutați-o pe Miruna să găsească răspunsul la întrebarea sa.

# Date de intrare


Fişierul `culori.in` conţine pe prima sa linie un singur număr natural $N$.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `culori.out` va conţine pe prima sa linie un singur număr întreg reprezentând numărul de moduri diferite în care Miruna ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 5 \ 000$;
* Pentru $25\%$ dintre teste $N \leq 45$.

    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Initialize the matrix for dynamic programming
# The matrix has 5 rows (for each color) and N columns (for each board)
dp = np.zeros((5, N), dtype=np.int64)

# Set the base cases for the first board
# Since the first board can be of any color,
# the number of ways to paint the first board with each color is 1
dp[:, 0] = 1

# Define the transition for each color
# Each row represents the next possible colors for the current color
# White, Blue, Red, Green, Yellow
transitions = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Next colors for White
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Next colors for Blue
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # Next colors for Red
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],  # Next colors for Green
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Next colors for Yellow
]

# Perform dynamic programming to fill in the matrix
for i in range(1, N):
    for color in range(5):
        dp[color, i] = np.dot(transitions[color], dp[:, i-1])

# The total number of ways is the sum of ways to end with each color after N boards
total_ways = dp.sum(axis=0)[-1]

# Write the result to the output file
with open('culori.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_ways))

Expected program to write result to `culori.out` and read from `culori.in`.
Do not use `input()` or `print()` to read input data or write output data.

Since the use of NumPy is leading to an error due to the module not being found, it appears that the environment we're working in does not have NumPy installed. As the task requires optimized memory and time usage, but we have a constraint on the libraries we can use, I'll rewrite the solution without NumPy, using only built-in Python functionality to optimize for efficiency within the given memory constraints.

```python
# Solution to the challenge without using numpy for environments where numpy is not available

def count_painting_ways(n):
    # Initialize the ways to paint the fence with 1 plank
    white, blue, red, green, yellow = 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

    for _ in range(1, n):
        # Calculate the number of ways to end with each color for the current plank
        next_white = blue  # Only blue can follow white
        next_blue = white + red  # Both white and red can follow blue
        next_red = blue + green  # Both blue and green can follow red
        next_green = red + yellow  # Both red and yellow can follow green
        next_yellow = green  # Only green can follow yellow

        # Update the number of ways for the next iteration
        white, blue, red, green, yellow = next_white, next_blue, next_red, next_green, next_yellow

    # The total number of ways to paint the fence is the sum of the number of ways to end with each color
    return white + blue + red + green + yellow

# Read the number of boards from the input file 'culori.in'
with open('culori.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the number of different ways Miruna could have painted the fence
total_ways = count_painting_ways(N)

# Write the result to the output file 'culori.out'
with open('culori.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_ways))
```
