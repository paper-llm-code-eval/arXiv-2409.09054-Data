Pasiunea Mirunei este să coloreze. Vacanţa trecută şi-a petrecut-o la bunica ei la ţară şi pentru că se cam plictisea s-a gândit să vopsească gardul de la casa bunicii.

Gardul este compus din $N$ scânduri dispuse una lângă alta. Miruna a găsit în garajul bunicii $5$ cutii de vopsea de culori diferite: **albă**, **albastră**, **roşie**, **verde** şi **galbenă**. Când a vopsit gardul, Miruna a respectat următoarele reguli:
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **alb**, următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **albastru**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **albastru**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **alb** sau **roşu**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **roşu**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **albastru** sau **verde**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **verde**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea cu **roșu** sau **galben**
-	Dacă o scândură era vopsită cu **galben**, atunci următoarea scândură o vopsea obligatoriu cu **verde**

După ce a și-a terminat treaba Miruna își admira “opera de artă” și se întreba în câte moduri diferite ar fi putut să vopsească gardul bunicii.

This solution reads from `culori.in` and writes to `culori.out`. The dynamic programming array `dp` is using a numpy array with `dtype=np.int32` to optimize memory usage. The solution should be within the memory constraints, and the logic is based on the given rules for painting the fence.

# Constants representing colors
WHITE, BLUE, RED, GREEN, YELLOW = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Read the number of planks N from the file 'culori.in'

```
This code uses NumPy to create a dynamic programming table (2D array) to compute the number of ways to paint the fence following the given rules. The solution reads the number of planks (N) from 'culori.in' and writes the total number of ways to paint the fence to 'culori.out'. No `input()` or `print()` functions are used.

total_ways = np.sum(dp[N - 1])

# Write the result to culori.out
with open('culori.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(total_ways))
```
The above code reads from a file named `culori.in`, computes the number of ways to paint the fence according to the given rules using dynamic programming, and writes the result to a file named `culori.out`. It optimizes both time and memory usage by using NumPy arrays and avoids overflow by using the `np.int64` data type.

It appears that the error is due to the usage of the NumPy library, which is not installed in the environment where the program is being executed. As the challenge requires optimization for both time and memory, and given the memory constraint, we need to find an alternative solution that does not rely on external libraries like NumPy. We can use Python's built-in list functionality for our dynamic programming approach.

Let's rewrite the solution without using NumPy:

```python
# Initialize the dp list with zeros
dp = [[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(N)]

# Color constants for readability
WHITE, BLUE, RED, GREEN, YELLOW = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Read N from culori.in
with open('culori.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())

# Set the base case: one plank can be painted in 5 ways
for color in range(5):
    dp[0][color] = 1

# Apply the transition rules given in the problem statement
for i in range(1, N):
    dp[i][WHITE] = dp[i - 1][BLUE]
    dp[i][BLUE] = dp[i - 1][WHITE] + dp[i - 1][RED]
    dp[i][RED] = dp[i - 1][BLUE] + dp[i - 1][GREEN]
    dp[i][GREEN] = dp[i - 1][RED] + dp[i - 1][YELLOW]
    dp[i][YELLOW] = dp[i - 1][GREEN]

# Calculate the total number of ways to color the fence
total_ways = sum(dp[N - 1])

# Write the result to culori.out
with open('culori.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(total_ways))
```

This code should meet the memory constraint and does not use NumPy, thereby avoiding the `ModuleNotFoundError`. It should work correctly in an environment where only the Python standard library is available.

The error occurs because I attempted to use the variable `N` before it was defined. In the code provided, the `dp` list is being initialized before reading the value of `N` from the file. I will correct the order of operations and ensure that `N` is read from the file before it is used to initialize the `dp` list. Here is the updated code:

```python
# Color constants for readability
WHITE, BLUE, RED, GREEN, YELLOW = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Read N from culori.in
with open('culori.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())

# Initialize the dp list with zeros
dp = [[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(N)]

# Set the base case: one plank can be painted in 5 ways
for color in range(5):
    dp[0][color] = 1

# Apply the transition rules given in the problem statement
for i in range(1, N):
    dp[i][WHITE] = dp[i - 1][BLUE]
    dp[i][BLUE] = dp[i - 1][WHITE] + dp[i - 1][RED]
    dp[i][RED] = dp[i - 1][BLUE] + dp[i - 1][GREEN]
    dp[i][GREEN] = dp[i - 1][RED] + dp[i - 1][YELLOW]
    dp[i][YELLOW] = dp[i - 1][GREEN]

# Calculate the total number of ways to color the fence
total_ways = sum(dp[N - 1])

# Write the result to culori.out
with open('culori.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(total_ways))
```

This code ensures that `N` is defined before it's used to initialize the `dp` list. It reads the value of N from 'culori.in', computes the number of ways to paint the fence, and writes the total number of ways to 'culori.out'.
