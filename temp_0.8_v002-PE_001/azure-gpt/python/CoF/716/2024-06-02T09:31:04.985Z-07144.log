Doi copii vopsesc un gard alcătuit din $n$ scânduri pe care le vom numerota de la $1$ la $n$ astfel: primul ia o cutie de vopsea roșie cu care vopsește scândurile cu numărul $p$, $2 \cdot p$, $3 \cdot p$, etc. Al doilea procedează la fel, începe de la același capăt al gardului, dar ia o cutie de vopsea albastră și vopsește din $q$ în $q$ scânduri. Astfel, când vor termina de vopsit, gardul va avea multe scânduri nevopsite, unele scânduri vopsite în roșu, altele în albastru, iar altele în violet (cele care au fost vopsite și cu roșu și cu albastru).

# Cerință

Cunoscând numerele $n, p$ și $q$ afișați:

1. câte scânduri rămân nevopsite
2. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în roșu
3. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în albastru
4. câte scânduri sunt vopsite în violet

# Date de intrare

De pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `gardul.in` se citește valoarea $n$, reprezentând numărul de scânduri din gard. De pe cea de a doua linie a fișierului de intrare se citesc valorile $p$ și $q$ separate de un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

În fișierul de ieșire `gardul.out` se vor afișa, în ordine, cele patru numere naturale cerute, câte unul pe un rând, ca în exemplu.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq p, q \leq 40 \ 000$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input data from the file
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as infile:
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Initialize the numpy arrays for the fence (using boolean type to save memory)
red_painted = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.bool8)
blue_painted = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.bool8)

# Paint the red positions (True for painted)
red_painted[p-1:n:p] = True

# Paint the blue positions (True for painted)
blue_painted[q-1:n:q] = True

# Count the painted positions
red_only = np.count_nonzero(red_painted & ~blue_painted)
blue_only = np.count_nonzero(blue_painted & ~red_painted)
violet = np.count_nonzero(red_painted & blue_painted)
unpainted = n - red_only - blue_only - violet

# Write the output to the file
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{unpainted}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{red_only}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{blue_only}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{violet}\n")
```
```

This solution uses NumPy boolean arrays to efficiently represent which parts of the fence are painted. It reads input from `gardul.in` and writes output to `gardul.out` as requested. This approach should be memory-efficient, as NumPy boolean arrays take up significantly less space compared to other data types. It's also time-efficient, as NumPy operations are highly optimized and run at C-speed under the hood.

# Paint the red positions (True for painted)
red_painted[p-1::p] = True

# Paint the blue positions (True for painted)
blue_painted[q-1::q] = True

# Using bitwise operations to determine the painted status
red_only = np.count_nonzero(red_painted & ~blue_painted)
blue_only = np.count_nonzero(blue_painted & ~red_painted)
violet = np.count_nonzero(red_painted & blue_painted)
unpainted = n - (red_only + blue_only + violet)

# Write the output to the file
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{unpainted}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{red_only}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{blue_only}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{violet}\n")
```
```

This updated solution should now function correctly according to the requirements of the problem, reading from `gardul.in` and writing to `gardul.out` without using `input()` or `print()`. The boolean arrays and bitwise operations are used to efficiently calculate the counts for each color, including the unpainted status.

Here is the entire solution rewritten with the necessary fixes, making sure not to use `input()` or `print()` functions and ensuring efficient usage of memory:

```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input data from the file
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as infile:
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Initialize the numpy arrays for the fence (using boolean type to save memory)
red_painted = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.bool8)
blue_painted = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.bool8)

# Determine the indices to be painted red and blue (1-indexed to 0-indexed)
indices_red = np.arange(p - 1, n, p, dtype=np.int32)
indices_blue = np.arange(q - 1, n, q, dtype=np.int32)

# Paint the red positions
red_painted[indices_red] = True

# Paint the blue positions
blue_painted[indices_blue] = True

# Calculate the counts
unpainted = n - np.count_nonzero(red_painted | blue_painted)
red_only = np.count_nonzero(red_painted) - np.count_nonzero(red_painted & blue_painted)
blue_only = np.count_nonzero(blue_painted) - np.count_nonzero(red_painted & blue_painted)
violet = np.count_nonzero(red_painted & blue_painted)

# Write the output to the file
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(str(unpainted) + '\n')
    outfile.write(str(red_only) + '\n')
    outfile.write(str(blue_only) + '\n')
    outfile.write(str(violet) + '\n')
```
This version of the script ensures that only the necessary amount of memory is used, by selecting appropriate data types and efficient Numpy operations. The script writes the results to 'gardul.out' as required.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module cannot be found. This suggests that `numpy` is not installed in the execution environment or that the environment does not allow third-party libraries such as `numpy`. Since we have a strict memory limit and cannot use `numpy`, we should implement an alternative solution that doesn't rely on any external libraries.

Let's proceed without using `numpy` and optimize the solution using built-in Python features.

```python
# Read the input data from the file
with open('gardul.in', 'r') as infile:
    n = int(infile.readline().strip())
    p, q = map(int, infile.readline().split())

# Calculate painted boards
red_painted = set(range(p, n + 1, p))
blue_painted = set(range(q, n + 1, q))
violet_painted = red_painted.intersection(blue_painted)

# Calculate counts
count_red_only = len(red_painted) - len(violet_painted)
count_blue_only = len(blue_painted) - len(violet_painted)
count_violet = len(violet_painted)
count_unpainted = n - (count_red_only + count_blue_only + count_violet)

# Write the output to the file
with open('gardul.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f"{count_unpainted}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{count_red_only}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{count_blue_only}\n")
    outfile.write(f"{count_violet}\n")
```

This solution should have a low memory footprint and adhere to the constraints of the problem. It only uses built-in data types and structures available in Python and keeps track of painted boards using sets, which are memory-efficient and fast for the operations performed. The output is written to 'gardul.out' as specified.
