Avem o matrice triunghiulară cu $n$ linii, cu elemente numere întregi. În această matrice putem construi un traseu după următoarea regulă:
- primul element al traseului este elementul $a_{1,1}$
- dacă elementul $a_{i,j}$ aparţine traseului, atunci următorul element al traseului poate fi doar $a_{i+1,j}$ sau $a_{i+1,j+1}$, pentru orice $1≤j≤i≤n$

Traseul se va codifica cu numerele de ordine ale coloanelor, parcurgând liniile de la $1$ la $n$. Valoarea traseului este egală cu suma elementelor ce îl formează.

~[summax.png]

Traseul evidenţiat în exemplul din dreapta are valoarea $5+4+6+5+4=24$, şi se codifică cu `1,2,3,3,4`.

Fie mulţimea tuturor traseelor de valoare maximă generate în ordine lexicografică și numerotate. Pentru exemplul alăturat avem șase trasee de lungime maximă:
* traseul $1$.	`1 1 1 1 2`     ($5+2+7+6+4=24$)
* traseul $2$.	`1 1 1 2 2`     ($5+2+7+6+4=24$)
* traseul $3$.	`1 2 2 2 2`     ($5+4+5+6+4=24$)
* traseul $4$.	`1 2 3 3 4`     ($5+4+6+5+4=24$)
* traseul $5$.	`1 2 3 4 4`     ($5+4+6+5+4=24$)
* traseul $6$.	`1 2 3 4 5`     ($5+4+6+5+4=24$)

# Cerinţă 
Cunoscând dimensiunea și elementele unei matrice triunghiulare, respectiv două numere naturale $\text{st}$ şi $\text{dr}$ ($\text{st}≤\text{dr}$), se cere să se determine:
1. Numărul total al traseelor de valoare maximă. În cazul în care această valoare depășește $2 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$, se va tipări valoarea $2 \ 000 \ 000 \ 001$;
2. Traseele cu numerele de ordine $\text{st}, \text{st}+1, \dots, \text{dr}$.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul `summax.in` conţine pe prima linie un număr natural $v$. Pentru toate testele de intrare, numărul $v$ poate avea doar valoarea $1$ sau $2$.
A doua linie conține trei numere naturale $n$, $\text{st}$ şi $\text{dr}$, separate prin spaţiu. Următoarele $n$ linii conțin câte o linie a matricei triunghiulare astfel: linia $i$ conține $i$ elemente, și anume valorile $a_{i,1} a_{i,2} ... a_{i,i}$ pentru orice $1≤i≤n$.

# Date de ieşire
Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $1$, se va rezolva numai punctul $1$ din cerință. În acest caz, în fişierul de ieşire `summax.out` se va scrie un singur număr natural ce reprezintă numărul traseelor de lungime maximă.

Dacă valoarea lui $v$ este $2$, se va rezolva numai punctul $2$ din cerință. În acest caz, în fişierul de ieşire `summax.out` se vor tipări pe câte o linie $n$ numere naturale separate prin spațiu, reprezentând codificările traseelor de valoare maximă cu numerele de ordine $\text{st}, \text{st}+1, \dots, \text{dr}$.

# Restricții și precizări
* $1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \ 000$;
* $1 ≤ st ≤ dr ≤ 2 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$;
* $1 ≤ dr – st ≤ 1 \ 000$;
* elementele matricei triunghiulare sunt numere naturale strict pozitive.
* valoarea maximă a traseului nu depășește $1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read from summax.in
with open('summax.in', 'r') as f:
    v = int(f.readline().strip())
    n, st, dr = map(int, f.readline().strip().split())
    triangle = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Convert the triangle into a numpy array for efficiency
triangle_np = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)
for i in range(n):
    triangle_np[i, :i+1] = triangle[i]

# Dynamic programming to calculate the number of paths with max sum
def calculate_max_paths(triangle, n):
    max_paths = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)
    max_paths[0][0] = 1  # Only one path to the top element
    max_sums = np.copy(triangle)
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            for k in [0, 1]:
                next_value = max_sums[i, j] + triangle[i + 1, j + k]
                if next_value > max_sums[i + 1, j + k]:
                    max_sums[i + 1, j + k] = next_value
                    max_paths[i + 1, j + k] = max_paths[i, j]
                elif next_value == max_sums[i + 1, j + k]:
                    max_paths[i + 1, j + k] += max_paths[i, j]
    
    return max_paths, max_sums[-1]

max_paths, last_row_max_sums = calculate_max_paths(triangle_np, n)
total_max_paths = sum(max_paths[-1, last_row_max_sums == last_row_max_sums.max()])

if v == 1:
    # Write to summax.out
    with open('summax.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(min(total_max_paths, 2000000001)) + '\n')
else:
    # TODO: implement generation of paths for v == 2
    raise NotImplementedError("Part 2 of the challenge is not implemented.")
```

Please note that for the purpose of addressing the task efficiently, the dynamic programming approach is used to compute the maximum sum and the number of paths leading to that sum. However, the second part of the task, which is to generate all the maximum sum paths and select the ones at positions `st` to `dr`, has not been implemented in this block as it requires additional logic to backtrack and generate the paths, while also being mindful of the memory constraints.

The implemented code block only solves the first part of the challenge, where `v == 1`, which asks for the total number of maximum sum paths. If `v == 2`, we'd have to extend the algorithm to generate the specific paths in an efficient manner, possibly using iteration with a stack-based approach to avoid recursion and reduce memory usage.

The provided Python environment seems not to have the `numpy` module installed, which is causing the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Since we need to optimize for memory usage and the `numpy` library is typically employed for its efficient memory management and performance, the absence of `numpy` is an issue.

Given that the environment does not have `numpy`, we can write a solution that uses plain Python lists and minimizes memory allocations by reusing the input triangle for both storing the maximum path sums and the count of paths leading to that sum. This approach should be more memory-efficient than creating separate data structures for these purposes.

Here is a rewritten solution without `numpy`:

```python
# Read from summax.in
with open('summax.in', 'r') as f:
    v = int(f.readline().strip())
    n, st, dr = map(int, f.readline().strip().split())
    triangle = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Function to calculate the number of paths with max sum
def calculate_max_paths(triangle):
    max_path_count = [[0] * (i + 1) for i in range(n)]
    max_path_count[0][0] = 1
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            for k in [0, 1]:
                if j + k < len(triangle[i + 1]):
                    next_value = triangle[i][j] + triangle[i + 1][j + k]
                    if next_value > triangle[i + 1][j + k]:
                        triangle[i + 1][j + k] = next_value
                        max_path_count[i + 1][j + k] = max_path_count[i][j]
                    elif next_value == triangle[i + 1][j + k]:
                        max_path_count[i + 1][j + k] += max_path_count[i][j]
    
    return max_path_count, triangle[-1]

max_path_count, last_row = calculate_max_paths(triangle)
total_max_paths = sum(count for val, count in zip(last_row, max_path_count[-1]) if val == max(last_row))

if v == 1:
    # Write to summax.out
    with open('summax.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(min(total_max_paths, 2000000001)) + '\n')
else:
    # TODO: implement generation of paths for v == 2
    raise NotImplementedError("Part 2 of the challenge is not implemented.")
```

This code addresses only the first part of the problem, similar to the initial code block. The second part, which involves generating and outputting the actual paths, remains unimplemented due to its complexity and the challenge of fitting it within the memory constraints using plain Python lists without `numpy`. Implementing this part would require a different approach to simulate the lexicographical ordering of paths and efficiently enumerate them without generating all possible paths, which could easily exceed the memory limit.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, I understand that the issue lies within the logic of the `calculate_max_paths` function. The function should identify the maximum sum that can be reached by any path and count all such paths. However, the current implementation seems to be incorrect, as it simply sums the path counts in the last row of the triangle, which is not the correct approach for counting all the possible maximum sum paths.

To fix this, we need to correctly implement the logic to calculate both the maximum sum and the count of paths leading to that sum. Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from summax.in
with open('summax.in', 'r') as f:
    v = int(f.readline().strip())
    n, st, dr = map(int, f.readline().strip().split())
    triangle = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Function to calculate the max sum and number of paths leading to that max sum
def calculate_max_paths(triangle):
    # Initialize a 2D list for max sums which reuses the input triangle
    max_sums = [row[:] for row in triangle]
    path_counts = [[0] * (i + 1) for i in range(n)]
    path_counts[0][0] = 1

    # Calculate max sums and path counts using dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            left_parent = max_sums[i - 1][j - 1] if j > 0 else 0
            right_parent = max_sums[i - 1][j] if j < i else 0
            max_parent = max(left_parent, right_parent)

            # Update the max sum for each cell
            max_sums[i][j] += max_parent

            # Update the path count for each cell
            if left_parent == max_parent:
                path_counts[i][j] += path_counts[i - 1][j - 1]
            if right_parent == max_parent:
                path_counts[i][j] += path_counts[i - 1][j]

    # Get the max sum from the last row
    max_sum = max(max_sums[-1])

    # Sum the counts of all paths that lead to the max sum
    total_max_paths = sum(path_counts[-1][j] for j in range(n) if max_sums[-1][j] == max_sum)

    return total_max_paths

# Calculate the total number of max sum paths
total_max_paths = calculate_max_paths(triangle)

# Output the result to summax.out
with open('summax.out', 'w') as f:
    # Write the minimum between total_max_paths and 2000000001
    f.write(str(min(total_max_paths, 2000000001)) + '\n')
```

This implementation calculates the maximum sum at each cell of the triangle and also counts the number of paths that can lead to that maximum sum at each cell. At the end, we sum up the counts of all the paths in the last row of the triangle that match the maximum sum. This should give us the correct number of maximum sum paths. Moreover, this solution does not use any external libraries and stays within the memory constraints provided by the problem specifications.

The expected output is different from the found output because the program was supposed to solve for `v == 2`, which requires generating and printing specific paths with numbers of order `st` to `dr`. Instead, the code provided was written to only solve for `v == 1`, which outputs the total number of paths with the maximum sum.

To address the requirements for `v == 2`, the program not only needs to calculate the total number of maximum sum paths but also needs to backtrack from the last row to the first row to generate specific paths and output them in lexicographic order.

Since the expected output requires a different solution, we need to implement a backtracking algorithm that enumerates the specific paths. Due to memory constraints, we cannot generate all paths in memory; we need to use a counting method to determine which paths correspond to numbers `st` to `dr`.

Here is the corrected solution that includes the code to solve for `v == 2`:

```python
def backtrack(triangle, path_counts, max_sums, max_sum, st, dr, n):
    paths = []
    for path_number in range(st, dr + 1):
        path = []
        current_sum = max_sum
        current_count = path_number
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            # Choose the left child if the number of paths through the left child is enough
            if i == 0 or path_counts[i - 1][len(path) - 1] >= current_count:
                path.append(len(path))
            else:
                # Otherwise, choose the right child
                current_count -= path_counts[i - 1][len(path) - 1]
                path.append(len(path) + 1)
        paths.append(path[::-1])  # Reverse path to get the correct order
    return paths

# Rest of the code remains the same up to the point where total_max_paths is calculated
# ...

# Output the result to summax.out
with open('summax.out', 'w') as f:
    if v == 1:
        f.write(str(min(total_max_paths, 2000000001)) + '\n')
    else:
        max_sum = max(max_sums[-1])
        selected_paths = backtrack(triangle, path_counts, max_sums, max_sum, st, dr, n)
        for path in selected_paths:
            f.write(' '.join(str(x + 1) for x in path) + '\n')
```

In this implementation, the `backtrack` function is introduced to generate and write to the file the paths corresponding to the `st` to `dr` path numbers. The function works by traversing the triangle from bottom to top, choosing the left or right child based on the number of paths leading through each child to reach a path count within the desired range. This approach avoids generating all paths, which would be infeasible due to memory constraints, and instead constructs only the paths requested. The paths are then written to the output file in the required format.
