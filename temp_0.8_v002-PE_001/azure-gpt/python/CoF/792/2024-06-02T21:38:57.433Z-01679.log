Mama mea este profesoară de informatică, dar îi place foarte mult să gătească. Recent am descoperit caietul ei de reţete, care arată foarte neobişnuit. Fiecare reţetă este scrisă pe un singur rând pe care sunt precizate produsele folosite, cantităţile, precum şi ordinea în care se execută operaţiile. De exemplu:

`(unt 50 zahar 250 ou 4)5`

ceea ce înseamnă că se amestecă $50$ grame unt cu $250$ grame zahăr şi cu $4$ ouă timp de $5$ minute. Pentru fiecare produs mama foloseşte întotdeauna aceeaşi unitate de măsură, aşa că unităţile de măsură nu mai sunt precizate. Numele produsului este scris întotdeauna cu litere mici, iar produsele şi cantităţile sunt separate prin spaţii (unul sau mai multe). Produsele care se amestecă împreună sunt încadrate între paranteze rotunde; după paranteza rotundă închisă este specificat timpul de preparare.

Evident, mama are şi reţeţe mai complicate:

`(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20`

Să traducem această reţetă: se amestecă $100$ grame zahăr cu $3$ ouă timp de cinci minute; apoi se adaugă $100$ grame unt şi $200$ grame nucă, amestecând totul încă $4$ minute. Se amestecă $200$ ml lapte cu $50$ grame de cacao şi $100$ grame zahăr timp de $3$ minute, apoi se toarnă peste compoziţia precedentă şi se amestecă totul timp de $20$ minute.

Observaţi că înainte sau după parantezele rotunde pot să apară sau nu spaţii.

# Cerinţă

Dată fiind o reţetă să se determine timpul total de preparare, precum şi cantităţile necesare din fiecare produs.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `reteta.in` conţine pe prima linie un şir de caractere care reprezintă o reţetă.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `reteta.out` va conţine pe prima linie timpul total necesar pentru prepararea reţetei. Pe următoarele linii sunt scrise ingredientele în ordine lexicografică (ordinea din dicţionar), câte un ingredient pe o linie. Pentru fiecare ingredient este specificat numele urmat de un spaţiu apoi de cantitatea totală necesară.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 <$ Lungimea unei reţete $≤ 1 \ 000$
* $1 ≤$ Numărul de ingrediente $≤ 100$
* Numele unui ingredient este scris cu maxim 20 litere mici ale alfabetului englez.
* Timpii de preparare sunt numere naturale $< 100$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Define a recursive function to calculate the total time and ingredients needed
def parse_recipe(recipe):
    while '(' in recipe:
        recipe = re.sub(r'\(([^\(^\)]+)\)(\d+)', process_chunk, recipe)
    return total_time, sorted(ingredients.items())

# Process each matched chunk from the regex
def process_chunk(match):
    global total_time
    chunk, time = match.groups()
    time = int(time)
    total_time += time
    for ingredient, quantity in re.findall(r'(\w+) (\d+)', chunk):
        ingredients[ingredient] += int(quantity) * time
    return ''

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Initialize total time and ingredients dictionary
total_time = 0
ingredients = defaultdict(int)

# Parse the recipe to get the total time and ingredients
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Write the total time and ingredients to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for ingredient, quantity in ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {quantity}\n')
```

This solution uses regular expressions to find the innermost parentheses, processes them, and flattens the recipe step by step. The `ingredients` dictionary holds the accumulated quantities of each ingredient. The total time is calculated by adding up the times after each processing step. The `parse_recipe` function is called recursively until there are no more parentheses to process. Then, the total time and sorted ingredients are written to the output file.

The exit code 137 indicates that the program was killed, usually due to exceeding memory limits or being manually terminated. Since we're dealing with a memory-sensitive problem and the code was supposed to avoid memory overuse, it is likely that the recursive calls with the repeated parsing of the string using regex is consuming too much memory.

To minimize memory usage, we can use an iterative approach to process the recipe and avoid regex for parsing, which can be expensive in terms of memory for large strings.

Here's a revised solution that uses an iterative stack-based approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def process_recipe(recipe):
    stack = []
    ingredient_quantities = defaultdict(int)
    total_time = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(recipe):
        if recipe[i] == '(':
            stack.append(i)
        elif recipe[i] == ')':
            start = stack.pop()
            end = i
            sub_recipe = recipe[start + 1:end]
            time_index = end + 1
            while time_index < len(recipe) and recipe[time_index].isdigit():
                time_index += 1
            time = int(recipe[end + 1:time_index])
            for item in sub_recipe.split():
                if item.isdigit():
                    quantity = int(item)
                    ingredient = sub_recipe.split()[sub_recipe.split().index(item)-1]
                    ingredient_quantities[ingredient] += quantity * time
            total_time += time
            recipe = recipe[:start] + recipe[time_index:]
            i = start - 1  # Adjust index to recheck the character at the start position
        i += 1

    return total_time, ingredient_quantities

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Process the recipe
total_time, ingredient_quantities = process_recipe(recipe)

# Write the total time and ingredients to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredient_quantities):
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {ingredient_quantities[ingredient]}\n')
```

This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening parenthesis positions and processes the innermost parentheses first. It avoids using regular expressions and instead uses simple string operations to parse the ingredients and quantities within the parentheses. This approach should be more memory-efficient.

The exit code 1 along with the ValueError in the stderr output indicates that the program is trying to convert an empty string to an integer, which happens when the time is not found after the closing parenthesis. This can occur if there's a space between the parenthesis and the time, or if there are no digits after the parenthesis. We need to ensure that the program correctly identifies and extracts the time value after the closing parenthesis.

We'll fix the program by adjusting the logic to handle the extraction of the time correctly, even if there are spaces or no digits present. Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def process_recipe(recipe):
    stack = []
    ingredient_quantities = defaultdict(int)
    total_time = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(recipe):
        if recipe[i] == '(':
            stack.append(i)
        elif recipe[i] == ')':
            if not stack:
                raise ValueError("Unmatched closing parenthesis.")
            start = stack.pop()
            end = i
            sub_recipe = recipe[start + 1:end].strip()
            time_index = end + 1
            # Skip any whitespace after the closing parenthesis
            while time_index < len(recipe) and recipe[time_index].isspace():
                time_index += 1
            # Find the end index of the time number
            time_end_index = time_index
            while time_end_index < len(recipe) and recipe[time_end_index].isdigit():
                time_end_index += 1
            # Extract the time (assuming there is no space before the digits)
            time_str = recipe[time_index:time_end_index]
            if not time_str:
                raise ValueError("No time specified after closing parenthesis.")
            time = int(time_str)
            total_time += time
            # Process the sub-recipe ingredients
            ingredients = sub_recipe.split()
            for j in range(0, len(ingredients), 2):
                ingredient = ingredients[j]
                quantity = int(ingredients[j + 1])
                ingredient_quantities[ingredient] += quantity * time
            # Modify the recipe to remove the processed part
            recipe = recipe[:start] + recipe[time_end_index:]
            i = start  # Adjust index to start at the new position
        i += 1  # Increment index
    return total_time, ingredient_quantities

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Process the recipe
total_time, ingredient_quantities = process_recipe(recipe)

# Write the total time and ingredients to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredient_quantities):
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {ingredient_quantities[ingredient]}\n')
```

This updated code includes proper handling of whitespace and checks for the presence of a time value after each closing parenthesis. The ingredient and quantity are now processed in pairs, assuming that they always appear in the format "ingredient quantity". If no time is specified (an empty string is found), the program raises a `ValueError`. This should fix the issue and prevent similar errors from occurring.

The results differ because of a logical error in the code. The code was not accounting for the nested nature of the ingredients correctly. Specifically, it was incorrectly multiplying the quantities of the ingredients by the time at each nesting level, which is not what the problem statement asked for.

According to the problem statement, the quantities of the ingredients should not be multiplied by the time; only the total time needs to be accumulated. The total time should include the time for each mixing operation, but the quantities of each ingredient should be summed directly without multiplying by the time.

Let's fix the code accordingly:

```python
# Define a function to process each chunk of the recipe
def process_chunk(chunk, multiplier):
    ingredients = {}
    while '(' in chunk:
        # Find the most inner chunk
        start = chunk.rfind('(')
        end = chunk.find(')', start)
        inner_chunk = chunk[start+1:end]
        time = int(chunk[end+1:].split()[0])
        # Process the inner chunk
        result = process_chunk(inner_chunk, multiplier * time)
        # Update the total time and ingredients
        for ingredient, quantity in result.items():
            ingredients[ingredient] = ingredients.get(ingredient, 0) + quantity
        # Prepare the recipe for the next iteration
        chunk = chunk[:start] + chunk[end+1+len(str(time)):]
    # Process the remaining ingredients (outermost level)
    parts = chunk.split()
    for i in range(0, len(parts), 2):
        ingredient, quantity = parts[i], int(parts[i+1]) * multiplier
        ingredients[ingredient] = ingredients.get(ingredient, 0) + quantity
    return ingredients

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Initialize total time and ingredients dictionary
total_time = 0
ingredients = {}

# Process the recipe to get the ingredients
ingredients = process_chunk(recipe, 1)

# Calculate the total time by searching for all the numbers followed by a right parenthesis
import re
time_list = [int(num) for num in re.findall(r'(\d+)\)', recipe)]
total_time = sum(time_list)

# Write the total time and ingredients to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients.keys()):
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n')
```

This code uses a recursive approach to process the recipe from the innermost parentheses to the outermost. It accumulates the ingredients' quantities without multiplying them by the time at each level. It calculates the total time separately by finding all digits followed by a closing parenthesis in the recipe and summing them up.

Let's test the rewritten solution against the original example:

Input (`reteta.in`):
```
(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20
```

Expected Output (`reteta.out`):
```
32
cacao 50
lapte 200
nuca 200
ou 3
unt 100
zahar 200
```

Running the code should now give the expected result.

---------- assistant ----------

The error is caused by the `int()` conversion attempt on a string that is not a valid integer representation. The code is attempting to convert `'3)20'` into an integer, which fails because it contains non-numeric characters. This happens when trying to extract the time directly after a closing parenthesis without considering potential subsequent characters.

To fix this, we need to correctly isolate the time value after each closing parenthesis, ensuring that we only attempt to convert valid numeric strings to integers. Here is the revised code with the necessary fixes:

```python
def process_chunk(chunk, multiplier, ingredients):
    while '(' in chunk:
        # Find the most inner chunk
        start = chunk.rfind('(')
        end = chunk.find(')', start)
        inner_chunk = chunk[start+1:end]
        time_index = end + 1
        while not chunk[time_index].isdigit():
            time_index += 1
        time_end_index = time_index
        while time_end_index < len(chunk) and chunk[time_end_index].isdigit():
            time_end_index += 1
        time = int(chunk[time_index:time_end_index]) * multiplier
        # Recursively process the inner chunk
        process_chunk(inner_chunk, time, ingredients)
        # Prepare the recipe for the next iteration
        chunk = chunk[:start] + chunk[time_end_index:]
    # Process the remaining ingredients (outermost level)
    parts = chunk.split()
    for i in range(0, len(parts), 2):
        ingredient, quantity = parts[i], int(parts[i+1])
        ingredients[ingredient] = ingredients.get(ingredient, 0) + quantity * multiplier

def calculate_total_time(recipe):
    time_sum = 0
    pattern = re.compile(r'\)\d+')
    for time_str in pattern.findall(recipe):
        time_sum += int(time_str[1:])
    return time_sum

# Initialize ingredients dictionary and read the recipe from the input file
ingredients = defaultdict(int)
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Process the recipe to get the ingredients
process_chunk(recipe, 1, ingredients)

# Calculate the total time
total_time = calculate_total_time(recipe)

# Write the total time and ingredients to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients.keys()):
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n')
```

In this corrected solution, we use separate functions `process_chunk` and `calculate_total_time`. The `process_chunk` function now correctly finds the time after each innermost chunk, taking into account that there might be other characters between the closing parenthesis and the time digits. `calculate_total_time` function uses a regex pattern to find all the time instances and sum them up to get the total time. This approach should work correctly and avoid the ValueError we encountered before.

The error message indicates that `defaultdict` is not defined because its import statement is missing. To fix the issue, we need to import `defaultdict` from the `collections` module. Additionally, the function `calculate_total_time` is called without being defined; we need to include its definition as well. Let's add these necessary parts to the solution and rewrite the entire solution with all corrections applied.

Here is the updated and corrected solution:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def process_chunk(chunk, multiplier, ingredients, times):
    # Process the chunk recursively to calculate ingredient quantities and times
    while '(' in chunk:
        start = chunk.rfind('(')
        end = chunk.find(')', start)
        inner_chunk = chunk[start + 1:end]
        time_index = end + 1
        while not chunk[time_index].isdigit():
            time_index += 1
        time_end_index = time_index
        while time_end_index < len(chunk) and chunk[time_end_index].isdigit():
            time_end_index += 1
        time = int(chunk[time_index:time_end_index])
        times.append(time * multiplier)
        process_chunk(inner_chunk, multiplier * time, ingredients, times)
        chunk = chunk[:start] + chunk[time_end_index:]
    # Add the outermost ingredients to the total
    parts = chunk.split()
    for i in range(0, len(parts), 2):
        ingredient, quantity = parts[i], int(parts[i + 1])
        ingredients[ingredient] += quantity * multiplier

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Initialize ingredients dictionary and list for times
ingredients = defaultdict(int)
times = []

# Process the recipe to get the ingredients and times
process_chunk(recipe, 1, ingredients, times)

# Calculate the total time
total_time = sum(times)

# Write the total time and ingredients to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients.keys()):
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n')
```

In this solution, we added the missing import statement for `defaultdict` and also corrected the usage of the `times` list to accumulate the total time spent on each part of the recipe. When processing chunks, we multiply the time by the current multiplier and add it to the `times` list. We then sum up all the times to get the total time.

This code should now work correctly without the `NameError` and should produce the expected output.

The output differs because the quantities of ingredients are being incorrectly multiplied by the time. According to the problem statement, the quantities should not be multiplied by the time; the time is only used to accumulate the total mixing time.

Let's fix the code to ensure that each ingredient's quantity is added directly to the total quantity without multiplying by the time, while still summing up the time for each mixing operation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def process_recipe(recipe, ingredient_quantities, total_time=0):
    while '(' in recipe:
        start = recipe.rfind('(')  # Find the innermost left parenthesis
        end = recipe.find(')', start)  # Find the corresponding right parenthesis
        # Extract the sub-recipe and the following time
        sub_recipe = recipe[start+1:end].strip()
        # Find the start of the mixing time number
        time_start = end + 1
        while time_start < len(recipe) and not recipe[time_start].isdigit():
            time_start += 1
        # Find the end of the mixing time number
        time_end = time_start
        while time_end < len(recipe) and recipe[time_end].isdigit():
            time_end += 1
        # Extract and accumulate the mixing time
        mixing_time = int(recipe[time_start:time_end])
        total_time += mixing_time
        # Process the ingredients in the sub-recipe
        sub_parts = sub_recipe.split()
        for i in range(0, len(sub_parts), 2):
            ingredient = sub_parts[i]
            quantity = int(sub_parts[i+1])
            ingredient_quantities[ingredient] += quantity
        # Remove the processed sub-recipe from the main recipe
        recipe = recipe[:start] + ' ' * (time_end - start) + recipe[time_end:]
    return total_time, ingredient_quantities

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Initialize total time and ingredient quantities
ingredient_quantities = defaultdict(int)

# Process the recipe and calculate the total time and ingredient quantities
total_time, ingredient_quantities = process_recipe(recipe, ingredient_quantities)

# Write the total time and ingredient quantities to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredient_quantities):
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {ingredient_quantities[ingredient]}\n')
```

In this code, we made sure to accumulate the ingredient quantities directly without multiplying by the mixing time. We still accumulate the total mixing time separately for each pair of parentheses. We use a `defaultdict` to store and sum the quantities of each ingredient easily. Finally, the ingredients are written to the output file sorted lexicographically.

This should produce the correct output according to the problem specifications.
