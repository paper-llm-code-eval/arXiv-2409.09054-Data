Mama mea este profesoară de informatică, dar îi place foarte mult să gătească. Recent am descoperit caietul ei de reţete, care arată foarte neobişnuit. Fiecare reţetă este scrisă pe un singur rând pe care sunt precizate produsele folosite, cantităţile, precum şi ordinea în care se execută operaţiile. De exemplu:

`(unt 50 zahar 250 ou 4)5`

ceea ce înseamnă că se amestecă $50$ grame unt cu $250$ grame zahăr şi cu $4$ ouă timp de $5$ minute. Pentru fiecare produs mama foloseşte întotdeauna aceeaşi unitate de măsură, aşa că unităţile de măsură nu mai sunt precizate. Numele produsului este scris întotdeauna cu litere mici, iar produsele şi cantităţile sunt separate prin spaţii (unul sau mai multe). Produsele care se amestecă împreună sunt încadrate între paranteze rotunde; după paranteza rotundă închisă este specificat timpul de preparare.

Evident, mama are şi reţeţe mai complicate:

`(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20`

Să traducem această reţetă: se amestecă $100$ grame zahăr cu $3$ ouă timp de cinci minute; apoi se adaugă $100$ grame unt şi $200$ grame nucă, amestecând totul încă $4$ minute. Se amestecă $200$ ml lapte cu $50$ grame de cacao şi $100$ grame zahăr timp de $3$ minute, apoi se toarnă peste compoziţia precedentă şi se amestecă totul timp de $20$ minute.

Observaţi că înainte sau după parantezele rotunde pot să apară sau nu spaţii.

# Cerinţă

Dată fiind o reţetă să se determine timpul total de preparare, precum şi cantităţile necesare din fiecare produs.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `reteta.in` conţine pe prima linie un şir de caractere care reprezintă o reţetă.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `reteta.out` va conţine pe prima linie timpul total necesar pentru prepararea reţetei. Pe următoarele linii sunt scrise ingredientele în ordine lexicografică (ordinea din dicţionar), câte un ingredient pe o linie. Pentru fiecare ingredient este specificat numele urmat de un spaţiu apoi de cantitatea totală necesară.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 <$ Lungimea unei reţete $≤ 1 \ 000$
* $1 ≤$ Numărul de ingrediente $≤ 100$
* Numele unui ingredient este scris cu maxim 20 litere mici ale alfabetului englez.
* Timpii de preparare sunt numere naturale $< 100$
* Cantităţile specificate în reţete sunt numere naturale $< 1 \ 000$
* Pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total se acordă $30\%$ din punctajul pe test; pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total şi afişarea corectă a ingredientelor (ordonate lexicografic) se acordă integral punctajul pe test

`reteta.in`
```
(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import re
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict
from functools import reduce

# Read the recipe from input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Regular expression to match groups of ingredients
regex = r'\(([^()]*)\)(\d+)'

# Function to process the content of each parenthesis
def process(match):
    ingredients, minutes = match.groups()
    minutes = int(minutes)
    total_time[0] += minutes  # Update total time
    # Split ingredients by space and parse pairs
    items = ingredients.split()
    for i in range(0, len(items), 2):
        ingredient_amounts[items[i]] += int(items[i + 1]) * minutes
    # Return empty string since we processed this group
    return ''

# Initialize dictionary for ingredients and their amounts
ingredient_amounts = defaultdict(int)
# Initialize total time counter
total_time = [0]

# Continuously apply the regex and process function until no more matches
while True:
    recipe, cnt = re.subn(regex, process, recipe)
    if cnt == 0:
        break

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredient_amounts.items())

# Write the output to file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write total time
    file.write(str(total_time[0]) + '\n')
    # Write ingredients and their total amounts
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {amount/total_time[0]}\n')  # Divide by total_time to correct for multiplication during processing
```

This code will parse the input recipe, calculate the total preparation time and the total amounts of each ingredient, and then save the results to the output file, while keeping memory usage to a minimum. The `collections.defaultdict` and `re` library are used for efficient processing. The regex handles the nesting of ingredients and their corresponding mixing times. The output is sorted lexicographically as required. Regular expressions along with the processing function iteratively reduce the recipe until all quantities are accounted for and multiplied by their respective mixing times. The use of numpy is not explicitly required as the operations are simple arithmetic and string manipulations.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. However, looking at the provided code, `numpy` is imported but not actually used anywhere. Since the task also specifies memory constraints and we should optimize for both time and memory usage, there's no need to use `numpy` for this particular problem. We can solve it using Python's built-in libraries, which should be more memory efficient in this case.

Let's rewrite the solution without importing `numpy` and with the fix applied:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the recipe from input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Regular expression to match groups of ingredients
regex = r'\(([^()]*)\)(\d+)'

# Function to process the content of each parenthesis
def process(match):
    ingredients, minutes = match.groups()
    minutes = int(minutes)
    total_time[0] += minutes  # Update total time
    # Split ingredients by space and parse pairs
    items = ingredients.split()
    for i in range(0, len(items), 2):
        ingredient_amounts[items[i]] += int(items[i + 1]) * minutes
    # Return empty string since we processed this group
    return ''

# Initialize dictionary for ingredients and their amounts
ingredient_amounts = defaultdict(int)
# Initialize total time counter
total_time = [0]

# Continuously apply the regex and process function until no more matches
while True:
    recipe, cnt = re.subn(regex, process, recipe)
    if cnt == 0:
        break

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredient_amounts.items())

# Write the output to file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write total time
    file.write(str(total_time[0]) + '\n')
    # Write ingredients and their total amounts
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {amount}\n')  # Removed division by total_time which was incorrect
```

This updated solution doesn't utilize `numpy`, and the erroneous division by `total_time[0]` in the final loop has been removed. The division was incorrect because we don't need to divide the total quantity by the total time; we only need to sum up the quantities multiplied by the time during each stage of the recipe. The rest of the code remains essentially the same, processing the recipe and outputting the total preparation time and quantities of each ingredient in lexicographical order.

Upon reviewing the differences between the expected and found results, the discrepancy lies in the way the ingredients and the total time are being calculated. The current solution incorrectly multiplies the ingredient amounts by the time mentioned immediately after a parenthesis set, which is not how the problem statement describes the recipe processing.

The correct way to handle this is by considering each parenthesis as a separate mixing action, using the time only once for the ingredients inside that specific parenthesis. The solution seems to incorrectly accumulate the mixing times for the ingredients as if they were mixed multiple times, which is not the case.

Additionally, the solution should not multiply the amounts of ingredients by their respective mixing times in the inner groupings. We should only add the specified amounts of ingredients as they appear in the recipe and sum the mixing times as separate quantities.

Let's rewrite the solution with the bug fixed:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_recipe(recipe, total_time, ingredient_amounts):
    while '(' in recipe:
        # Find the most inner parentheses
        match = re.search(r'\(([^()]*)\)(\d+)', recipe)
        if not match:
            break
        ingredients, minutes = match.groups()
        minutes = int(minutes)
        total_time[0] += minutes  # Update total time
        # Replace the parentheses with a placeholder to avoid reprocessing
        recipe = recipe[:match.start()] + "X" * (match.end() - match.start()) + recipe[match.end():]
        # Split ingredients by space and parse pairs
        items = ingredients.split()
        for i in range(0, len(items), 2):
            ingredient_amounts[items[i]] += int(items[i + 1])
    return recipe

# Initialize dictionary for ingredients and their amounts
ingredient_amounts = defaultdict(int)
# Initialize total time counter
total_time = [0]

# Read the recipe from input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe
parse_recipe(recipe, total_time, ingredient_amounts)

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredient_amounts.items())

# Write the output to file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write total time
    file.write(str(total_time[0]) + '\n')
    # Write ingredients and their total amounts
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {amount}\n')
```

Now, this solution processes innermost parentheses first, adds the corresponding mixing time to the total, and adds the ingredients' amounts only once per grouping, not multiplied by any mixing times. After all ingredients and times have been processed, the results are written to the output file in lexicographic order.

The error indicates that the code is trying to convert a string that does not represent an integer ('unt') into an integer. This likely means that the list `items` does not contain the data in the expected format, which should be pairs of an ingredient followed by an amount.

The parsing logic should be updated to correctly identify and separate the ingredient names from their amounts within the parentheses. Let's fix the parsing code to handle the ingredients correctly:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to process a match of ingredients and time
def process_ingredients(ingredients, time, ingredient_amounts):
    items = ingredients.split()
    for i in range(0, len(items), 2):
        ingredient = items[i]
        amount = int(items[i + 1])
        ingredient_amounts[ingredient] += amount
    return time

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Initialize dictionary for ingredients and their amounts
ingredient_amounts = defaultdict(int)
# Initialize total time counter
total_time = 0

# Regular expression to match groups of ingredients and time
regex = r'\(([^()]*)\)(\d+)'

# Continuously apply the regex and process function until no more matches
while True:
    match = re.search(regex, recipe)
    if not match:
        break
    ingredients, time = match.groups()
    total_time += int(time)  # Update total time
    process_ingredients(ingredients, int(time), ingredient_amounts)
    # Replace processed part with 'X' to avoid reprocessing
    recipe = recipe[:match.start()] + 'X' * (match.end() - match.start()) + recipe[match.end():]

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredient_amounts.items())

# Write the output to the file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write total time
    file.write(str(total_time) + '\n')
    # Write ingredients and their total amounts
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {amount}\n')
```

With this modified solution, the `process_ingredients` function correctly parses the ingredients and their amounts, adding them to the `ingredient_amounts` dictionary. The main loop continues to process the recipe until no more matches are found, updating the total time and replacing processed parts with 'X' to avoid reprocessing. The final sorted ingredients and total time are written to the output file.

The error message indicates that the conversion of `items[i + 1]` to an integer is failing because the value is 'unt', which is not a number. This suggests that the list `items` does not contain an even number of elements, where each ingredient name should be followed by its corresponding amount. If there's an odd number of elements, it means an ingredient name is being incorrectly identified as an amount.

To fix the program, I will add a check to ensure that `items` contains pairs before attempting to process them. Additionally, I will add exception handling to provide better diagnostics if such an error occurs again.

Here's the rewritten solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to process a match of ingredients and time
def process_ingredients(ingredients, ingredient_amounts):
    items = ingredients.split()
    if len(items) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("The ingredient list does not contain pairs of names and amounts.")
    for i in range(0, len(items), 2):
        ingredient = items[i]
        amount = int(items[i + 1])
        ingredient_amounts[ingredient] += amount

# Initialize dictionary for ingredients and their amounts
ingredient_amounts = defaultdict(int)
# Initialize total time counter
total_time = 0

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Regular expression to match groups of ingredients and time
regex = r'\(([^()]*)\)(\d+)'

# Continuously apply the regex and process function until no more matches
while True:
    match = re.search(regex, recipe)
    if not match:
        break
    ingredients, time = match.groups()
    total_time += int(time)  # Update total time
    process_ingredients(ingredients, ingredient_amounts)
    # Replace processed part with 'X' to avoid reprocessing
    recipe = recipe[:match.start()] + 'X' * (match.end() - match.start()) + recipe[match.end():]

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredient_amounts.items())

# Write the output to the file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write total time
    file.write(str(total_time) + '\n')
    # Write ingredients and their total amounts
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {amount}\n')
```

This updated version of the solution should correctly parse the input file, calculate the total time, aggregate the ingredient amounts, and write them to the output file sorted lexicographically. The added check ensures that only valid pairs of ingredient names and amounts are processed, preventing the conversion error we saw earlier.

The error message is telling us that the ingredient list (the string of names and amounts within parentheses) does not contain pairs of names and amounts. This error was deliberately introduced in the previous fix to ensure that each ingredient name is followed by an amount, but it seems that the check is failing—most likely because the items are not properly split into pairs. This might happen if there are extra spaces in the input.

Instead of relying on the number of items for validation, we should ensure that every other element in the `items` list is an integer (representing the amount), and the others are strings (representing ingredient names). We'll rewrite the parsing function to reflect this.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to process a match of ingredients and time
def process_ingredients(ingredients, time, ingredient_amounts):
    items = ingredients.split()
    # Iterate through pairs of (ingredient, amount)
    for i in range(0, len(items), 2):
        ingredient = items[i]
        amount = int(items[i + 1])
        ingredient_amounts[ingredient] += amount * time

# Initialize dictionary for ingredients and their amounts
ingredient_amounts = defaultdict(int)
# Initialize total time counter
total_time = 0

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Regular expression to match groups of ingredients and time
regex = r'\(([^()]*)\)(\d+)'

# Continuously apply the regex and process function until no more matches
while True:
    match = re.search(regex, recipe)
    if not match:
        break
    ingredients, time = match.groups()
    total_time += int(time)  # Update total time
    process_ingredients(ingredients, int(time), ingredient_amounts)
    # Replace processed part with 'X' to avoid reprocessing
    recipe = recipe[:match.start()] + 'X' * (match.end() - match.start()) + recipe[match.end():]

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredient_amounts.items())

# Write the output to the file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write total time
    file.write(str(total_time) + '\n')
    # Write ingredients and their total amounts
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {amount}\n')
```

This solution will process pairs of ingredients and amounts, ensuring that each ingredient is followed by its amount, and accumulate the amounts, multiplying by the time for each mixing action in the parentheses. It will then write the total time and ingredients to the output file.

The error indicates that the code still attempts to convert a string representing an ingredient name ('unt') into an integer, which fails. This suggests that the `items` list isn't properly parsed into pairs of ingredients and amounts as the assumption about the input being strictly alternating between names and amounts isn't correct.

The issue seems to lie in the way the regex is used to split the ingredients and their amounts. The regex assumes that there are no leading or trailing spaces within the parentheses, and that there is exactly one space between the ingredient and its amount. The input might not conform to this assumption.

To fix this, we will adjust the regular expression to allow for variable amounts of whitespace, and we will more robustly check that we have pairs of ingredients and amounts. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Read the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Initialize dictionary for ingredients and their amounts
ingredient_amounts = defaultdict(int)
# Initialize total time counter
total_time = 0

# Function to process a match of ingredients and time
def process_ingredients(ingredients, time, ingredient_amounts):
    # Split by whitespace and filter out empty strings
    items = list(filter(None, re.split(r'\s+', ingredients)))
    for i in range(0, len(items), 2):
        ingredient = items[i]
        amount = int(items[i + 1])
        ingredient_amounts[ingredient] += amount

# Regular expression to match groups of ingredients and time
regex = r'\(\s*([^()]*)\s*\)(\d+)'

# Continuously apply the regex and process function until no more matches
while True:
    match = re.search(regex, recipe)
    if not match:
        break
    ingredients, time = match.groups()
    time = int(time)
    total_time += time  # Update total time
    process_ingredients(ingredients, time, ingredient_amounts)
    # Replace processed part with a placeholder to avoid reprocessing
    recipe = recipe[:match.start()] + 'X' * (match.end() - match.start()) + recipe[match.end():]

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredient_amounts.items())

# Write the output to the file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write total time
    file.write(f'{total_time}\n')
    # Write ingredients and their total amounts
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f'{ingredient} {amount}\n')
```

This solution includes an updated regex that allows for spaces inside the parentheses and uses `re.split` with `filter(None, ...)` to only capture non-empty strings as ingredient names and amounts. The processing of ingredients happens only once per group with parentheses regardless of the time specified, and the total time is summed up separately. This should address the issue and properly output the total time and ingredient amounts to the 'reteta.out' file.
