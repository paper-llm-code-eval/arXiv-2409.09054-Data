Mama mea este profesoară de informatică, dar îi place foarte mult să gătească. Recent am descoperit caietul ei de reţete, care arată foarte neobişnuit. Fiecare reţetă este scrisă pe un singur rând pe care sunt precizate produsele folosite, cantităţile, precum şi ordinea în care se execută operaţiile. De exemplu:

`(unt 50 zahar 250 ou 4)5`

ceea ce înseamnă că se amestecă $50$ grame unt cu $250$ grame zahăr şi cu $4$ ouă timp de $5$ minute. Pentru fiecare produs mama foloseşte întotdeauna aceeaşi unitate de măsură, aşa că unităţile de măsură nu mai sunt precizate. Numele produsului este scris întotdeauna cu litere mici, iar produsele şi cantităţile sunt separate prin spaţii (unul sau mai multe). Produsele care se amestecă împreună sunt încadrate între paranteze rotunde; după paranteza rotundă închisă este specificat timpul de preparare.

Evident, mama are şi reţeţe mai complicate:

`(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20`

Să traducem această reţetă: se amestecă $100$ grame zahăr cu $3$ ouă timp de cinci minute; apoi se adaugă $100$ grame unt şi $200$ grame nucă, amestecând totul încă $4$ minute. Se amestecă $200$ ml lapte cu $50$ grame de cacao şi $100$ grame zahăr timp de $3$ minute, apoi se toarnă peste compoziţia precedentă şi se amestecă totul timp de $20$ minute.

Observaţi că înainte sau după parantezele rotunde pot să apară sau nu spaţii.

# Cerinţă

Dată fiind o reţetă să se determine timpul total de preparare, precum şi cantităţile necesare din fiecare produs.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `reteta.in` conţine pe prima linie un şir de caractere care reprezintă o reţetă.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `reteta.out` va conţine pe prima linie timpul total necesar pentru prepararea reţetei. Pe următoarele linii sunt scrise ingredientele în ordine lexicografică (ordinea din dicţionar), câte un ingredient pe o linie. Pentru fiecare ingredient este specificat numele urmat de un spaţiu apoi de cantitatea totală necesară.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 <$ Lungimea unei reţete $≤ 1 \ 000$
* $1 ≤$ Numărul de ingrediente $≤ 100$
* Numele unui ingredient este scris cu maxim 20 litere mici ale alfabetului englez.
* Timpii de preparare sunt numere naturale $< 100$
* Cantităţile specificate în reţete sunt numere naturale $< 1 \ 000$
* Pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total se acordă $30\%$ din punctajul pe test; pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total şi afişarea corectă a ingredientelor (ordonate lexicografic) se acordă integral punctajul pe test

    ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    total_time = 0

    for group, time in matches:
        time = int(time)
        total_time += time

            sub_time_str = str(sub_time)
            for ingredient, quantity in ingredients.items():
                replacement = ingredient + ' ' + str(quantity) + ' '

# Read the recipe from the file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Calculate the ingredients and total time
ingredients, total_time = calculate_recipe(recipe)

# Write the results to the output file
write_output('reteta.out', total_time, ingredients)
```

This solution reads a recipe from `reteta.in`, calculates the total time and quantity of each ingredient needed, and writes the results to `reteta.out`. Please note that it does not use any additional libraries and should be memory efficient, as it does not store large data structures or create substantial temporary lists or arrays. The regular expressions used are compact, and the data processed are kept to a minimum necessary for the calculations and output.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed after running out of memory or because the system needed to reclaim resources. Since we cannot use standard out or standard error to print any debugging information, we need to ensure the memory usage is optimized and the program does not have any infinite loops or excessive memory allocations.

Upon closer inspection of the initial code, I realize that the `parse_subrecipe` function is not handling nested subrecipes correctly, which could potentially lead to an infinite loop if the regular expression does not reduce the recipe correctly. The solution has to efficiently handle nested subrecipes and calculate the quantities and times without redundancy.

Here's a rewritten solution that uses a stack to handle the nested subrecipes, which should be both time and memory-efficient:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to calculate the total preparation time and quantities for each ingredient
def calculate_recipe(recipe):
    # Initialize a stack and variables to store ingredients and total time
    stack = []
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    total_time = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the recipe
    for char in recipe:
        if char.isdigit() or char.isalpha() or char == ' ':
            # Keep building the current number or word
            if stack and (stack[-1][-1].isdigit() or stack[-1][-1].isalpha()):
                stack[-1] += char
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        elif char == '(':
            # Start a new subrecipe
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            # End of a subrecipe, calculate the quantities
            subrecipe = ''
            while stack[-1] != '(':
                subrecipe = stack.pop() + subrecipe
            stack.pop() # Remove the '(' from the stack
            time = int(stack.pop())
            total_time += time
            
            # Process the ingredients in this subrecipe
            current_ingredients = default_dict(int)
            for part in subrecipe.split():
                if part.isdigit():
                    quantity = int(part)
                else:
                    current_ingredients[part] += quantity
                    ingredients[part] += quantity * time
            # Push the total time of this subrecipe back to the stack for the outer recipe
            stack.append(str(time))
    
    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the recipe from the file
with open('reteta.in') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Calculate the ingredients and total time
total_time, ingredients = calculate_recipe(recipe)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(total_time) + '\n')
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

This solution uses a stack to handle the nested structure of the recipes, pushing characters onto the stack as it encounters them, and popping them off to process subrecipes. This should avoid the memory and time issues related to recursion or inefficient string handling. Additionally, the `defaultdict` is used to count ingredient quantities, which is a space-efficient data structure for this purpose.

The error message indicates that the code attempted to convert a string containing `'('` to an integer, which is not possible and raises a `ValueError`. This suggests that the stack-based logic is not correctly identifying the components of the subrecipe, or it's not correctly popping items off the stack.

We need to ensure that when we pop elements from the stack to calculate the time for a subrecipe, we are indeed popping off a string that represents a number. It seems that the structure of the code that processes the end of a subrecipe and calculates the time might be flawed.

I will rewrite the solution, making sure that the handling of parentheses and the stack is correct.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import re

def calculate_recipe(recipe):
    # Stack for nested operations and a dictionary for ingredients
    stack = []
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Regular expression to match ingredients and their quantities
    ingredient_pattern = re.compile(r'(\w+)\s+(\d+)')
    
    # Go through each character in the recipe
    for char in recipe:
        if char == ')':
            # End of a current subrecipe
            subrecipe = ''
            # Pop from the stack until we find the matching '('
            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':
                subrecipe = stack.pop() + subrecipe
            stack.pop() # Remove the '('
            # Now, get the total time for this subrecipe
            time = ''
            while stack and stack[-1].isdigit():
                time = stack.pop() + time
            time = int(time)
            # Parse ingredients in the subrecipe and update the total quantities
            for ingredient, quantity in ingredient_pattern.findall(subrecipe):
                ingredients[ingredient] += int(quantity) * time
            # Push the total time of this subrecipe back to the stack
            stack.append(' ' + str(time) + ' ')
        elif char == '(' or char.isdigit() or char.isalpha() or char.isspace():
            # Start of a subrecipe, a quantity, an ingredient, or a space
            stack.append(char)
    
    # Calculate total time by summing times on the stack
    total_time = sum(int(time) for time in ingredient_pattern.findall(''.join(stack)))
    
    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the recipe from the file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Calculate the ingredients and total time
total_time, ingredients = calculate_recipe(recipe)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

This corrected solution ensures that when we encounter a `')'`, we pop elements off the stack until we find its matching `'('`. We then parse the subrecipe within those parentheses, multiplying the quantities by the time associated with that subrecipe. We then push the total time of the subrecipe back onto the stack as a string with surrounding spaces to ensure we can correctly identify it later. We sum the times at the end to get the total time. The `ingredient_pattern` regex is used to match and extract ingredients and their quantities from the subrecipe strings.

The error `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''` suggests that an empty string is being passed to `int()`, which cannot be converted to a number. This error likely occurred because the code expects there to be a number representing the time immediately before a ')' but did not find one. This might happen if the recipe format is not as expected or if there is a logical mistake in my code that processes the stack.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the time string is not empty before converting it to an integer and that the recipe format is being parsed correctly. Let's adjust the code accordingly, ensuring that we correctly handle the time extraction and all possible edge cases:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import re

def calculate_recipe(recipe):
    # Use a stack for keeping track of the current context
    stack = []
    # Use a dictionary to keep track of ingredient totals
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    # Initialize total_time to 0
    total_time = 0

    # Expression to match ingredient and quantity
    ingredient_pattern = re.compile(r'(\w+)\s+(\d+)')

    # Convert the recipe to a list of tokens (words and numbers)
    tokens = re.findall(r'\(|\)|\d+|\w+', recipe)

    # Process each token
    for token in tokens:
        if token == ')':
            # Process a completed subrecipe
            sub_time = 0
            sub_ingredients = []

            while True:
                # Get the last item in the stack
                item = stack.pop()
                if item == '(':
                    break
                elif item.isdigit():
                    # This is the time, add to sub_time
                    sub_time += int(item)
                else:
                    # This is an ingredient, add to the sub_ingredients list
                    sub_ingredients.append(item)

            # Update total_time
            total_time += sub_time

            # Multiply sub_ingredients by sub_time
            for ingredient, quantity in ingredient_pattern.findall(' '.join(sub_ingredients)):
                ingredients[ingredient] += int(quantity) * sub_time
        else:
            # For all other tokens, just add to the stack
            stack.append(token)

    # Return the calculated total time and ingredients dict
    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the recipe from the file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Calculate the ingredients and total time
total_time, ingredients = calculate_recipe(recipe)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients.keys()):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

This revised solution ensures that the time is only converted to an integer after checking that the token is a digit and not an empty string. It also handles the extraction of ingredients and quantities from the subrecipes correctly, multiplying them by the subrecipe's time. The output is ordered lexicographically as required.

Upon evaluating the difference between the expected and actual output, it is clear that the total time calculation is incorrect. The expected output indicates that the time for each subrecipe should not be summed repeatedly as subrecipes are nested within each other. The error in the original implementation lies in the way the sub_times are added to the total_time; they should be factored by their nesting level rather than being added directly.

Let's fix the algorithm to ensure that we correctly calculate the total time by adding the time for each subrecipe only once, and correctly aggregate the quantities of ingredients, multiplying them by the time specified after their respective subrecipe.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import re

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    """Parse the recipe and return the total time and ingredient quantities."""
    pattern = re.compile(r"\(([^()]+)\)(\d+)")
    stack = []  # Stack to keep track of subrecipes and their times
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)  # Dictionary to store ingredient quantities
    total_time = 0  # Variable to store total preparation time

    # Find all subrecipes and their times
    while '(' in recipe:
        for subrecipe, time in re.findall(pattern, recipe):
            time = int(time)
            total_time += time  # Add the time of the current subrecipe
            new_subrecipe = ''  # String to build the new subrecipe with multiplied quantities
            for ingredient, quantity in re.findall(r'(\w+)\s+(\d+)', subrecipe):
                quantity = int(quantity) * time
                ingredients[ingredient] += quantity
                new_subrecipe += f"{ingredient} {quantity} "  # Add multiplied ingredient quantities
            # Replace the original subrecipe in the recipe with the new one containing updated quantities
            recipe = recipe.replace(f"({subrecipe}){time}", str(new_subrecipe.strip()), 1)
            stack.append(time)  # Push the time to the stack

    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the recipe from the file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Calculate the ingredients and total time
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients.keys()):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

In this solution, I use a regular expression pattern to find subrecipes and their respective times. I then process each subrecipe, multiplying the ingredient quantities by the time, and replace the subrecipe in the original recipe with a new string that reflects these updated quantities. In this way, each time is added only once to the total time, and ingredient quantities are correctly aggregated. After processing all subrecipes, the `ingredients` dictionary holds the correct totals for all ingredients. The output is sorted lexicographically and written to `reteta.out`.

The exit code 137 indicates that the program was likely killed due to exceeding the memory limit. Since we have a memory limit of ~8MB, we must be very cautious about the memory usage of our program.

A possible reason for the memory overflow is the use of string replacements in a loop which may create many temporary strings. This operation is not memory efficient, especially if the recipe string becomes very large after replacements. In the context of the recipe, the memory issue might arise from repeatedly manipulating the recipe string during the while-loop.

We need to handle the parsing without creating many intermediate strings. To do this, we can use a stack to evaluate the recipe in a linear pass without modifying the original recipe string. We will accumulate the ingredients as we parse the recipe, and only multiply the quantities when we complete a sub-recipe.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_recipe(recipe):
    stack = []  # Stack to keep track of sub-recipes
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)  # Dictionary to store ingredient quantities
    current_ingredients = defaultdict(int)  # Current sub-recipe ingredients
    number = ''  # Current number (could be quantity or time)

    for char in recipe:
        if char.isdigit():
            number += char  # Build the current number
        elif char.isalpha():
            # If we encounter an ingredient name, we add the previous number as its quantity
            stack.append((number, char))  # (quantity, ingredient)
            number = ''  # Reset current number
        elif char == '(':
            # New sub-recipe begins; push current ingredients to the stack and reset
            stack.append(current_ingredients)
            current_ingredients = defaultdict(int)
        elif char == ')':
            time = int(number)  # Time for the current sub-recipe
            number = ''  # Reset current number

            # Pop ingredients until we reach a dictionary (start of sub-recipe)
            while stack and isinstance(stack[-1], tuple):
                quantity, ingredient = stack.pop()
                current_ingredients[ingredient] += int(quantity) * time

            # Merge the current sub-recipe ingredients with the outer recipe
            prev_ingredients = stack.pop()
            for ingredient, quantity in current_ingredients.items():
                prev_ingredients[ingredient] += quantity
            current_ingredients = prev_ingredients

    # At the end, current_ingredients will hold all ingredient totals
    total_time = sum(current_ingredients.values())  # Total time is the sum of all quantities

    return total_time, current_ingredients

# Read the recipe from the file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Calculate the ingredients and total time
total_time, ingredients = calculate_recipe(recipe)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients.keys()):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

This solution leverages a stack to keep track of sub-recipes and ingredients without modifying the original recipe string, avoiding the memory overhead caused by string operations. The ingredients are accumulated in a `defaultdict` as we parse the recipe, ensuring memory efficiency. The total time is the summation of all quantities for each ingredient multiplied by the time specified in their sub-recipe. The final results are written to `reteta.out`.

The `ValueError` was caused by trying to convert an empty string to an integer, which happened because `quantity` was an empty string at the time of the conversion. This issue likely occurred because the code does not properly handle cases where the character immediately following a closing parenthesis is not a digit, thus `number` is set to an empty string when it's expected to be the multiplier (the time).

To fix this, we need to ensure that we properly handle the end of the sub-recipe and correctly process the time multiplier. We'll adjust the algorithm to make sure the multiplier is captured correctly after each sub-recipe and that we don't attempt to convert an empty string into an integer.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_recipe(recipe):
    stack = []  # Stack to keep track of ingredients and times
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)  # Dictionary to store ingredient totals
    number = ''  # String to accumulate the current number (quantity or time)
    total_time = 0  # Variable to accumulate total preparation time
    
    # Helper function to add ingredients to the total
    def add_ingredients(quantity, ingredients, stack):
        quantity = int(quantity)
        while stack and isinstance(stack[-1], tuple):
            ingredient, multiplier = stack.pop()
            ingredients[ingredient] += quantity * multiplier
    
    # Parse the recipe string
    for char in recipe:
        if char.isdigit():
            number += char
        elif char.isalpha():
            stack.append((number, char))  # Push (quantity, ingredient) as a tuple
            number = ''
        elif char == '(':
            stack.append('(')  # Mark the start of a sub-recipe
        elif char == ')':
            # End of current sub-recipe, calculate ingredient totals with multiplier
            multiplier = int(number)
            number = ''
            sub_ingredients = defaultdict(int)
            # Process the stack until we reach the start of the sub-recipe
            while stack[-1] != '(':
                add_ingredients(multiplier, sub_ingredients, stack)
            stack.pop()  # Remove '(' from the stack
            # Add the sub-ingredients to the main stack with their multiplier
            for ingredient, quantity in sub_ingredients.items():
                stack.append((quantity, ingredient))
            total_time += multiplier  # Add the sub-recipe time to the total time
    
    # Process any remaining ingredients at the top level
    add_ingredients(1, ingredients, stack)
    
    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the recipe from the file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Calculate the ingredients and total time
total_time, ingredients = calculate_recipe(recipe)

# Write the results to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, quantity in sorted(ingredients.items()):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {quantity}\n")
```

This solution ensures that the multiplier (time) for a sub-recipe is correctly processed after each closing parenthesis. When a sub-recipe is complete, it calculates the total quantities for each ingredient in that sub-recipe based on the multiplier. It also ensures that the multiplier and ingredient totals are handled correctly using a stack to manage the nested structure. The final total time is the sum of all multipliers for the sub-recipes. The ingredients are summed up and written to `reteta.out` in lexicographical order.
