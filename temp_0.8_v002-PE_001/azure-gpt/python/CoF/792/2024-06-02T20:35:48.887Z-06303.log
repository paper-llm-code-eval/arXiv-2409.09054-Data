Mama mea este profesoară de informatică, dar îi place foarte mult să gătească. Recent am descoperit caietul ei de reţete, care arată foarte neobişnuit. Fiecare reţetă este scrisă pe un singur rând pe care sunt precizate produsele folosite, cantităţile, precum şi ordinea în care se execută operaţiile. De exemplu:

`(unt 50 zahar 250 ou 4)5`

ceea ce înseamnă că se amestecă $50$ grame unt cu $250$ grame zahăr şi cu $4$ ouă timp de $5$ minute. Pentru fiecare produs mama foloseşte întotdeauna aceeaşi unitate de măsură, aşa că unităţile de măsură nu mai sunt precizate. Numele produsului este scris întotdeauna cu litere mici, iar produsele şi cantităţile sunt separate prin spaţii (unul sau mai multe). Produsele care se amestecă împreună sunt încadrate între paranteze rotunde; după paranteza rotundă închisă este specificat timpul de preparare.

Evident, mama are şi reţeţe mai complicate:

`(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20`

Să traducem această reţetă: se amestecă $100$ grame zahăr cu $3$ ouă timp de cinci minute; apoi se adaugă $100$ grame unt şi $200$ grame nucă, amestecând totul încă $4$ minute. Se amestecă $200$ ml lapte cu $50$ grame de cacao şi $100$ grame zahăr timp de $3$ minute, apoi se toarnă peste compoziţia precedentă şi se amestecă totul timp de $20$ minute.

Observaţi că înainte sau după parantezele rotunde pot să apară sau nu spaţii.

# Cerinţă

Dată fiind o reţetă să se determine timpul total de preparare, precum şi cantităţile necesare din fiecare produs.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `reteta.in` conţine pe prima linie un şir de caractere care reprezintă o reţetă.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `reteta.out` va conţine pe prima linie timpul total necesar pentru prepararea reţetei. Pe următoarele linii sunt scrise ingredientele în ordine lexicografică (ordinea din dicţionar), câte un ingredient pe o linie. Pentru fiecare ingredient este specificat numele urmat de un spaţiu apoi de cantitatea totală necesară.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 <$ Lungimea unei reţete $≤ 1 \ 000$
* $1 ≤$ Numărul de ingrediente $≤ 100$
* Numele unui ingredient este scris cu maxim 20 litere mici ale alfabetului englez.
* Timpii de preparare sunt numere naturale $< 100$
* Cantităţile specificate în reţete sunt numere naturale $< 1 \ 000$
* Pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total se acordă $30\%$ din punctajul pe test; pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total şi afişarea corectă a ingredientelor (ordonate lexicografic) se acordă integral punctajul pe test

# reteta_solver.py
import numpy as np

from collections import Counter

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    # Matches: '(' followed by anything except '(' or ')', followed by ')'
    pattern = r'\(([^()]*)\)\s*(\d+)'
    while '(' in recipe:

                     + ' ' + recipe[match.end():]
            break  # Only replace the first match in each iteration
    # No more parentheses, now we only need to sum the quantities of each ingredient
    final_ingredients = recipe.strip().split()
    total_time = 0
    ingredient_counter = Counter()
    for i in range(0, len(final_ingredients), 2):
        ingredient = final_ingredients[i]
        quantity = int(final_ingredients[i + 1])
        if ingredient == 'time':
            total_time += quantity
        else:
            ingredient_counter[ingredient] += quantity
    return total_time, ingredient_counter

# Load the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe and sum the quantities and time
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Save the total time and the ingredients with their quantities to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, quantity in sorted(ingredients.items()):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {quantity}\n")
```

This code should be placed in a `.py` file (e.g., `reteta_solver.py`) and executed in a Python environment. The use of regular expressions allows us to extract and process the nested ingredients in each set of parentheses iteratively. The `Counter` object from the `collections` module helps us to sum the quantities of each ingredient conveniently. After the input is read from 'reteta.in', the output is written to 'reteta.out' as specified.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. However, in the provided solution, we actually don't use `numpy` at all. The import statement for `numpy` is unnecessary and can be safely removed. Let's revise the code to eliminate the unused import and make sure the program uses only standard Python libraries to remain within the memory constraints:

```python
# reteta_solver.py
import re
from collections import Counter

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    # Matches: '(' followed by anything except '(' or ')', followed by ')'
    pattern = r'\(([^()]*)\)\s*(\d+)'
    total_time = 0
    while '(' in recipe:
        matches = re.finditer(pattern, recipe)
        for match in matches:
            ingredients = match.group(1).strip().split()
            time = int(match.group(2))
            total_time += time
            # Create a dictionary with ingredient names as keys and quantities as values
            ingredient_dict = {ingredients[i]: int(ingredients[i + 1]) for i in range(0, len(ingredients), 2)}
            # Replace the current match with its processed value
            recipe = recipe[:match.start()] + ' ' + ' '.join(f"{k} {v}" for k, v in ingredient_dict.items()) \
                     + ' ' + recipe[match.end():]
            break  # Only replace the first match in each iteration

    # No more parentheses, now we only need to sum the quantities of each ingredient
    final_ingredients = recipe.strip().split()
    ingredient_counter = Counter()
    for i in range(0, len(final_ingredients), 2):
        ingredient = final_ingredients[i]
        quantity = int(final_ingredients[i + 1])
        ingredient_counter[ingredient] += quantity

    return total_time, ingredient_counter

# Load the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe and sum the quantities and time
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Save the total time and the ingredients with their quantities to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, quantity in sorted(ingredients.items()):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {quantity}\n")
```

The revised code removes the `numpy` import and ensures that all operations are performed using standard Python libraries, which should meet both the memory and performance requirements for the challenge. It reads from `reteta.in` and writes the results to `reteta.out` as required.

Upon reviewing the provided output, it seems that the code did not correctly account for the time factor when summing the quantities of each ingredient. The ingredients inside a parentheses group have to be multiplied by the time specified after that group. The multiplication by the time factor was mistakenly omitted from the final summation of ingredients.

I will correct this by ensuring that the quantities are multiplied by the time factor at each step of the iteration when we collapse the parentheses.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# reteta_solver.py
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    def process_group(match):
        inner_content, time_multiplier = match.groups()
        # Split content by ingredient and quantity pairs and multiply by the time factor
        ingredients = inner_content.strip().split()
        for i in range(0, len(ingredients), 2):
            ingredient = ingredients[i]
            quantity = int(ingredients[i + 1]) * int(time_multiplier)
            ingredients[i + 1] = str(quantity)
        return ' '.join(ingredients) + f" time {time_multiplier}"

    # Matches: '(' followed by anything except '(' or ')', followed by ')' and a number for time
    pattern = r'\(([^()]*)\)\s*(\d+)'
    total_time = 0
    while '(' in recipe:
        recipe = re.sub(pattern, process_group, recipe)

    # No more parentheses, now we only need to sum the quantities of each ingredient
    final_ingredients = recipe.strip().split()
    ingredient_counter = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(0, len(final_ingredients), 2):
        key = final_ingredients[i]
        value = int(final_ingredients[i + 1])
        if key == 'time':
            total_time += value
        else:
            ingredient_counter[key] += value

    return total_time, ingredient_counter

# Load the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe and sum the quantities and time
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Save the total time and the ingredients with their quantities to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, quantity in sorted(ingredients.items()):
        # We only want to write ingredients (not time) to the file
        if ingredient != 'time':
            file.write(f"{ingredient} {quantity}\n")
```

This code should process the recipe correctly, taking into account the multiplication of ingredient quantities by the time factor after each group of parentheses. It will produce the correct total time and quantities of ingredients and write them to `reteta.out` in lexicographical order.

Upon reviewing the output, it appears that there is a significant issue with the multiplication of ingredient amounts by the nested time factors. The quantities of ingredients should be multiplied by the time factor of their respective group, and this multiplication should be cumulative for nested groups. However, the current implementation is erroneously applying the time factor repeatedly at each level of nesting, which leads to the excessively large quantities observed in the output.

Let's address this by tracking the multiplication factor at each level of nesting correctly. Each time we process a group, we'll apply the time factor only for that group and carry the factor to any nested groups within it.

Here is the re-implemented solution:

```python
# reteta_solver.py
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_group(match):
    content, time = match.groups()
    time = int(time)
    ingredients = re.findall(r'([a-z]+) (\d+)', content)
    # Multiply each ingredient's quantity by the time factor
    multiplied_ingredients = [(name, int(quantity) * time) for name, quantity in ingredients]
    # Return the multiplied ingredients as a string, including the time as a special ingredient
    return ' '.join(f"{name} {quantity}" for name, quantity in multiplied_ingredients) + f" time {time}"

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    # Matches: '(' followed by anything except '(' or ')', followed by ')' and a number for time
    pattern = r'\(([^()]*)\)\s*(\d+)'
    while '(' in recipe:
        recipe = re.sub(pattern, parse_group, recipe)

    # No more parentheses, now we sum the quantities of each ingredient, including the time
    ingredients = re.findall(r'([a-z]+) (\d+)', recipe)
    ingredient_counter = defaultdict(int)
    for name, quantity in ingredients:
        ingredient_counter[name] += int(quantity)

    total_time = ingredient_counter.pop('time', 0)
    return total_time, ingredient_counter

# Load the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe and sum the ingredients and time
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Save the total time and the ingredients with their quantities to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

This revised solution properly handles the multiplication of ingredient quantities by nested time factors. It will only multiply each ingredient's quantity by the time factor of their group and will accumulate properly for nested groups. The 'time' ingredient is treated specially to sum the total time, and it is excluded from the final output. This should provide the correct output as specified in the example.

The issue in the previous solution is that the multiplication of quantities is not applied correctly for nested groups. The multiplication should be cumulative for nested groups but not applied multiple times for the same group. In the previous solution, the multiplication was applied repeatedly as we iterated through the nested groups, which resulted in the incorrect, excessively large quantities.

We need to implement a different approach that tracks the cumulative time factor as we parse through the nesting levels and only applies it to the ingredient quantities at that level.

Let's implement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# reteta_solver.py
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def process_recipe(recipe, time_factor=1):
    total_time = 0
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)

    # Pattern to find the innermost parentheses with their time factors
    pattern = re.compile(r'\(([^()]*)\)\s*(\d+)')

    # Find all innermost parentheses and process them
    while '(' in recipe:
        for inner_recipe, inner_time in re.findall(pattern, recipe):
            inner_time = int(inner_time)
            # Process the inner recipe recursively, adjusting the time factor
            inner_total_time, inner_ingredients = process_recipe(inner_recipe, time_factor * inner_time)
            total_time += inner_total_time
            for ingredient, quantity in inner_ingredients.items():
                ingredients[ingredient] += quantity

        # Replace the innermost parentheses with an empty string after processing
        recipe = pattern.sub('', recipe)

    # Now process any remaining ingredients outside of parentheses
    for ingredient, quantity in re.findall(r'([a-z]+)\s+(\d+)', recipe):
        ingredients[ingredient] += int(quantity) * time_factor

    # Add the time factor to the total time as a special ingredient to be summed
    total_time += time_factor
    return total_time, ingredients

# Load the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe and sum the ingredients and time
total_time, ingredients = process_recipe(recipe)

# Save the total time and the ingredients with their quantities to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    # Write the total time
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    # Write the ingredients sorted lexicographically
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients):
        if ingredient != 'time':
            file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

In this solution, we use a recursive function `process_recipe` that correctly applies the cumulative time factor to the ingredient quantities in each nested group. The total time for mixing is also correctly accumulated. This approach should provide the correct output with the total time and ingredient quantities, written to `reteta.out` in lexicographic order of ingredients.

The issue with the previous solution is that the time was treated as a special ingredient, which led to incorrect time accumulation, and the quantities of the ingredients are still not properly calculated. It is important to separately accumulate the total time and to correctly manage the cumulative multiplication of ingredient quantities within nested parentheses.

The correct approach is to parse the recipe in a structured manner, identifying each group of ingredients and their associated time, and then to apply the time factor correctly to each ingredient. This must be done recursively as we may have multiple levels of nested parentheses.

Here's the corrected solution, which should properly handle the time and quantities of ingredients:

```python
# reteta_solver.py
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    ingredient_counts = defaultdict(int)
    total_time = 0

    # Find innermost parentheses
    while '(' in recipe:
        parenthesis_groups = re.findall(r'\(([^\(\)]+)\)(\d+)', recipe)
        for group, time in parenthesis_groups:
            time = int(time)
            # Update total time
            total_time += time
            # Multiply the ingredient quantities by the group time and sum up
            ingredients = group.split()
            for i in range(0, len(ingredients), 2):
                ingredient = ingredients[i]
                quantity = int(ingredients[i + 1]) * time
                ingredient_counts[ingredient] += quantity
            # Remove the processed group from recipe and replace with a marker
            recipe = recipe.replace(f"({group}){time}", " ", 1)

    return total_time, dict(ingredient_counts)

# Load the recipe from the input file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe and sum the ingredients and time
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Save the total time and the ingredients with their quantities to the output file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient in sorted(ingredients.keys()):
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {ingredients[ingredient]}\n")
```

This solution first finds the innermost parentheses and processes the contained ingredients by multiplying their quantities by the associated time factor. It then updates the total time and sums the ingredient quantities in `ingredient_counts`. After processing a group, it removes the group from the recipe string. This process repeats until no parentheses remain. The final ingredient counts are then written to the output file `reteta.out`.
