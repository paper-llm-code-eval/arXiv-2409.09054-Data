Mama mea este profesoară de informatică, dar îi place foarte mult să gătească. Recent am descoperit caietul ei de reţete, care arată foarte neobişnuit. Fiecare reţetă este scrisă pe un singur rând pe care sunt precizate produsele folosite, cantităţile, precum şi ordinea în care se execută operaţiile. De exemplu:

`(unt 50 zahar 250 ou 4)5`

ceea ce înseamnă că se amestecă $50$ grame unt cu $250$ grame zahăr şi cu $4$ ouă timp de $5$ minute. Pentru fiecare produs mama foloseşte întotdeauna aceeaşi unitate de măsură, aşa că unităţile de măsură nu mai sunt precizate. Numele produsului este scris întotdeauna cu litere mici, iar produsele şi cantităţile sunt separate prin spaţii (unul sau mai multe). Produsele care se amestecă împreună sunt încadrate între paranteze rotunde; după paranteza rotundă închisă este specificat timpul de preparare.

Evident, mama are şi reţeţe mai complicate:

`(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20`

Să traducem această reţetă: se amestecă $100$ grame zahăr cu $3$ ouă timp de cinci minute; apoi se adaugă $100$ grame unt şi $200$ grame nucă, amestecând totul încă $4$ minute. Se amestecă $200$ ml lapte cu $50$ grame de cacao şi $100$ grame zahăr timp de $3$ minute, apoi se toarnă peste compoziţia precedentă şi se amestecă totul timp de $20$ minute.

Observaţi că înainte sau după parantezele rotunde pot să apară sau nu spaţii.

# Cerinţă

Dată fiind o reţetă să se determine timpul total de preparare, precum şi cantităţile necesare din fiecare produs.


# Date de intrare


Fişierul de intrare `reteta.in` conţine pe prima linie un şir de caractere care reprezintă o reţetă.

# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `reteta.out` va conţine pe prima linie timpul total necesar pentru prepararea reţetei. Pe următoarele linii sunt scrise ingredientele în ordine lexicografică (ordinea din dicţionar), câte un ingredient pe o linie. Pentru fiecare ingredient este specificat numele urmat de un spaţiu apoi de cantitatea totală necesară.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 <$ Lungimea unei reţete $≤ 1 \ 000$
* $1 ≤$ Numărul de ingrediente $≤ 100$
* Numele unui ingredient este scris cu maxim 20 litere mici ale alfabetului englez.
* Timpii de preparare sunt numere naturale $< 100$
* Cantităţile specificate în reţete sunt numere naturale $< 1 \ 000$
* Pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total se acordă $30\%$ din punctajul pe test; pentru determinarea corectă a timpului total şi afişarea corectă a ingredientelor (ordonate lexicografic) se acordă integral punctajul pe test

```
(((zahar 100 ou 3)5 unt 100 nuca 200)4 (lapte 200 cacao 50 zahar 100) 3)20

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed or not found. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no actual usage of `numpy`. Therefore, the simplest fix is to remove the import statement for `numpy` since it is unnecessary. Here is the corrected code:


```python

    stack = []
    current_ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    total_time = 0

The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` caused by trying to pop from an empty list, which means that the stack is empty when the code is trying to pop from it. This can happen if parentheses are not correctly balanced in the input recipe or if the logic to handle parentheses is not correctly implemented.

To fix the error, we need to make sure that the code correctly handles the opening and closing of parentheses, pushing and popping from the stack in the right order.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    stack = [defaultdict(int)]  # Initialize stack with an empty dictionary
    total_time = 0
    
    for part in re.finditer(r'(\((?:[^()]*)\)(\d+))|(\b[a-z]+\b)\s+(\d+)', recipe):
        if part.group(1):  # If we found a complete recipe segment
            inner_time = int(part.group(2))
            total_time += inner_time
            # Merge ingredients from stack top to the next dictionary on the stack
            inner_ingredients = stack.pop()
            for ingredient, amount in inner_ingredients.items():
                stack[-1][ingredient] += amount * inner_time
        else:  # We found an ingredient with its amount
            ingredient, amount = part.group(3), int(part.group(4))
            # Add ingredient and amount to the current (or top of stack) dictionary
            stack[-1][ingredient] += amount

        # If segment starts with '(', then push an empty dictionary onto the stack
        if part.group(0).startswith('('):
            stack.append(defaultdict(int))
    
    # The remaining ingredients on the top of the stack are outside of any parentheses and don't need multiplying
    return total_time, stack.pop()

# Read the input
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredients.items())

# Write the output
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {amount}\n")
```

This code initializes the stack with one empty dictionary to ensure we always have a dictionary to pop from. It also assumes that the input recipe is correctly formatted, meaning that parentheses will always be properly closed. If not, the code would need additional logic to handle such cases.

The result differs because the code incorrectly calculates the total time by not considering nested parentheses and their associated multiplication factors. Moreover, the code incorrectly calculates the amounts of the ingredients. It should multiply the amounts by the time factor at each nesting level, but it seems to only apply the time factor at the current level.

Let's take another approach to fix the code using a recursive algorithm that can handle nested parentheses. This way, we can ensure that the time factors are applied correctly to each nested segment and the total time is accumulated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def process_segment(segment, multiplier):
    total_time = 0
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)

    # Iterate over the nested segments and ingredients in the current segment
    for inner_segment, time, ingredient, amount in re.findall(r'(\((?:[^()]*)\)(\d+))|(\b[a-z]+\b)\s+(\d+)', segment):
        if inner_segment:
            # Process inner segment recursively
            inner_time, inner_ingredients = process_segment(inner_segment[1:-1], int(time))
            total_time += inner_time
            # Add the ingredients from the inner segment
            for ing, amt in inner_ingredients.items():
                ingredients[ing] += amt
        elif ingredient:
            # Add the ingredient and its amount
            ingredients[ingredient] += int(amount)

    # Apply the time multiplier to the ingredients
    for ing in ingredients:
        ingredients[ing] *= multiplier

    # Return the total time for this segment and its ingredients
    return total_time * multiplier, ingredients

def parse_recipe(recipe):
    total_time, ingredients = process_segment(recipe, 1)
    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the input
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredients.items())

# Write the output
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {amount}\n")
```

This code uses a recursive function `process_segment` that processes each segment of the recipe, correctly applying the time multipliers and accumulating the total time. The recursion allows it to handle nested parentheses properly. Then, in the sorted output, we ensure that the ingredients are displayed lexicographically.

The result differs because the implementation of time calculation is incorrect and the ingredient amounts are not being handled properly at each level of nesting. The total time should accumulate as the sum of each nested operation's time plus the time for mixing at that level, and the ingredient amounts should only be multiplied by their immediate mixing time, not by the product of all mixing times up their hierarchy.

Let's reimplement the solution to correctly calculate the total time and ingredient amounts. We need a function to process each nested segment and combine the results correctly:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_segment(segment):
    # This will hold the accumulated time and ingredients for this segment
    segment_time = 0
    segment_ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Find all inner segments and ingredients with amounts
    for inner_segment, time, ingredient, amount in re.findall(r'(\(([^()]*)\)(\d+))|(\b[a-z]+\b)\s+(\d+)', segment):
        if inner_segment:  # Nested segment found
            # Recursively parse the nested segment
            inner_time, inner_ingredients = parse_segment(inner_segment[1:-1])
            # Multiply the inner ingredients by their specific mix time
            for key, value in inner_ingredients.items():
                segment_ingredients[key] += value * int(time)
            # Add the inner segment mix time to the segment time
            segment_time += inner_time + int(time)
        elif ingredient:  # Ingredient found
            # Add the ingredient and its amount directly to the segment ingredients
            segment_ingredients[ingredient] += int(amount)
    
    return segment_time, segment_ingredients

# Read the input from 'reteta.in' file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe
total_time, ingredients = parse_segment(recipe)

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredients.items())

# Write the output to 'reteta.out' file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {amount}\n")
```

This solution uses recursion to process each nested segment by calling `parse_segment` and calculates the time for each segment correctly. The ingredients at each level are multiplied only by their respective mixing time, not by the nesting levels' mix times. It then writes the correctly calculated total time and sorted ingredients to the output file.

The error message indicates there is a mismatch between the number of capturing groups in the regular expression and the number of variables we are trying to assign the captured values to. This is happening because `re.findall` is returning all capturing groups, and we have five groups in our regular expression but only four variables in the assignment.

To fix this, we should either update the regular expression to have the correct number of capturing groups or update the variables in the assignment to match the number of capturing groups. We will update the regular expression and the loop assignment to correctly handle the capturing groups.

Let's fix the code:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_recipe(segment, multiplier=1):
    total_time = 0
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Find all inner segments and ingredients with amounts
    parts = re.findall(r'(\(([^()]*)\))(\d+)|(\b[a-z]+\b)\s+(\d+)', segment)
    for inner_segment, inner_content, inner_time, ingredient, amount in parts:
        if inner_segment:  # Nested segment found
            # Recursively parse the nested segment
            time, inner_ingredients = parse_recipe(inner_content, int(inner_time))
            # Add the inner segment mix time to the segment time
            total_time += time + int(inner_time) * multiplier
            # Multiply the inner ingredients by their specific mix time and the current multiplier
            for ing, amt in inner_ingredients.items():
                ingredients[ing] += amt * int(inner_time) * multiplier
        elif ingredient:  # Ingredient found
            # Add the ingredient and its amount directly to the segment ingredients multiplied by the current multiplier
            ingredients[ingredient] += int(amount) * multiplier
    
    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the input from 'reteta.in' file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredients.items())

# Write the output to 'reteta.out' file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {amount}\n")
```

In this fixed code, we adjust the regular expression to correctly capture the nested recipe segments and ingredients. The `parse_recipe` function is now correctly called recursively and handles the ingredient amounts and total time calculation as expected. The results are then sorted and written to the output file `reteta.out`.

The result differs because the ingredient amounts are being calculated incorrectly. The amounts are being multiplied by the inner segment times and the multiplier for each outer segment, resulting in incorrect values.

To fix this, we should ensure that the ingredients are only multiplied by the mixing time of their immediate enclosing segment, not the cumulative time of all nested segments. Additionally, the total time should be the sum of time spent in each nested segment, not multiplied by the multiplier. 

Let's correct the code:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_recipe(segment):
    # This regex will match either an ingredient with its amount or a sub-recipe with its time
    matches = re.findall(r'(\(([^()]*)\)(\d+))|(\b[a-z]+\b)\s+(\d+)', segment)
    
    ingredients = defaultdict(int)
    total_time = 0

    for sub_recipe, _, time, ingredient, amount in matches:
        if sub_recipe:  # This is a sub-recipe
            # Recursively parse the sub-recipe
            sub_time, sub_ingredients = parse_recipe(sub_recipe[1:-1])
            # Multiply the ingredients by the time for this sub-recipe
            for ing, amt in sub_ingredients.items():
                ingredients[ing] += amt * int(time)
            # Add the time for this sub-recipe to the total time
            total_time += sub_time + int(time)
        elif ingredient:  # This is an ingredient
            # Add the ingredient amount to the ingredients
            ingredients[ingredient] += int(amount)
    
    return total_time, ingredients

# Read the input from 'reteta.in' file
with open('reteta.in', 'r') as file:
    recipe = file.read().strip()

# Parse the recipe
total_time, ingredients = parse_recipe(recipe)

# Sort the ingredients lexicographically
sorted_ingredients = sorted(ingredients.items())

# Write the output to 'reteta.out' file
with open('reteta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{total_time}\n")
    for ingredient, amount in sorted_ingredients:
        file.write(f"{ingredient} {amount}\n")
```

In this corrected code, we only multiply the ingredients by the time of their immediate enclosing segment. The total time is calculated as the sum of the times for each sub-recipe plus the time to mix that sub-recipe, not multiplied by any multipliers. This should give us the correct total time and ingredient amounts.
