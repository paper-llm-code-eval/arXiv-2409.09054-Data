Un teren de fotbal este folosit pentru aterizarea elicopterelor. Gazonul de pe stadion este parcelat în pătrăţele de aceeaşi dimensiune, cu laturile paralele cu marginile terenului. Liniile cu pătrăţele de gazon sunt numerotate de sus în jos cu numerele $1, 2, \dots, m$, iar coloanele cu pătrăţele de gazon sunt numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numerele $1, 2, \dots, n$. Din cauza tipului diferit de iarbă se ştie care dintre pătrăţele de gazon sunt afectate sau nu de umbră. Acest lucru este precizat printr-un tablou bidimensional $a$ cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu elemente $0$ şi $1$ ($a_{ij} = 0$ înseamnă că pătrăţelul aflat pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$ este afectat de umbră, iar $a_{ij} = 1$ înseamnă că pătrăţelul aflat pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$ nu este afectat de umbră). Fiecare elicopter are $3$ roţi pe care se sprijină. Roţile fiecărui elicopter determină un triunghi dreptunghic isoscel. Elicopterele aterizează, astfel încât triunghiurile formate să fie cu catetele paralele cu marginile terenului. În exemplul următor avem patru elicoptere.

~[elicop.png|width=30em]

Pentru a preciza poziţia unui elicopter pe teren este suficient să cunoaştem linia şi coloana vărfurilor ipotenuzei şi poziţia vârfului deasupra (codificată prin $1$) sau dedesubtul ipotenuzei (codificată prin $-1$). Pentru exemplu, elicopterul din stânga sus este dat prin $(1, 1), (3, 3)$ şi $-1$, cel din dreapta sus prin $(1, 9), (5, 5)$ şi $1$, cel din stânga jos prin $(5, 1), (6, 2)$ şi $1$, iar cel din dreapta jos prin $(5, 9), (6, 8)$ şi $1$.
Un elicopter se consideră că a aterizat *greşit*, dacă triunghiul format sub el (definit mai sus) are mai mult de jumătate din pătrăţele afectate de umbră.
Administratorul terenului de fotbal doreşte să determine numărul $N_1$ de elicoptere, care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren şi numerele de ordine al elicopterelor, care au aterizat *greşit* în ordine crescătoare: $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$, ştiind că există $k$ elicoptere codificate prin numerele $1, 2, \dots, k$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine, pentru fişierul cu datele din enunţ: numărul de elicoptere $N_1$, care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren şi numerele de ordine al elicopterelor, care au aterizat *greşit* în ordine crescătoare, precedate de numărul lor $N_2$.

# Date de intrare


Prima linie a fişierului de intrare `elicop.in` conţine două numere naturale $m$ şi $n$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ. Următoarele $m$ linii conţin câte $n$ numere $0$ sau $1$, separate prin câte un spaţiu cu semnificaţia $0$ – pătrăţel de gazon care este afectat de umbră, respectiv $1$ - pătrăţel care nu este afectat de umbră. Pe linia $m+2$ se află numărul de elicoptere $k$, iar pe următoarele $k$ linii (în ordinea codificării lor $1, 2, \dots, k$) câte cinci numere separate prin cate un spaţiu, pentru liniile şi coloanele ipotenuzelor şi poziţia vârfului ($1$ sau $-1$), triunghiurilor dreptunghice asociate elicopterelor: $L_1 \ C_1 \ L_2 \ C_2 \ p$.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `elicop.out` va conţine două linii: prima linie numărul $N_1$ de elicoptere, pe care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren, a doua linie cu numerele naturale $N_2, e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$ separate prin câte un spaţiu, în ordine crescătoare.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* $1 \leq k \leq 40$
* Nu există suprapuneri de triunghiuri asociate la două elicoptere.
* Triunghiurile asociate elicopterelor conţin cel puţin trei pătrăţele.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a valorilor $N_1$ se obţine $40$% din punctajul unui test, iar pentru determinarea corectă a valorilor $N_2, e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$ se obţine $60$% din punctajul unui test.

import numpy as np

# Read data from file

```

This Python code checks whether each helicopter has landed correctly by counting the number of affected squares within the triangle it forms. It uses NumPy for efficient data handling and writes the results to the output file.

The code respects the memory limit by using `np.int8` for the grid, as each element only needs to hold 0 or 1. The auxiliary function `helicopter_landed_correctly` checks half of the triangle size against the number of affected squares to determine if the landing is correct.

The provided example should yield the expected output when this code is run.

The error that caused the exit code is due to the fact that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment. Since I cannot install `numpy` or other external libraries, I must modify the solution to not use `numpy` and rely purely on standard Python built-in functionalities.

Below is the rewritten solution without using `numpy` or any external libraries.

```python
# Read data from file
with open('elicop.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Auxiliary function to check if the helicopter landed correctly
def helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p):
    half_size = ((abs(L2 - L1) + 1) * (abs(C2 - C1) + 1)) // 2
    affected = 0
    L1, L2 = min(L1, L2), max(L1, L2)
    C1, C2 = min(C1, C2), max(C1, C2)

    for i in range(L1, L2 + 1):
        for j in range(C1, C2 + 1):
            if i - L1 == j - C1: continue
            if p == -1 and i - L1 < j - C1: continue
            if p == 1 and i - L1 > j - C1: continue
            affected += 1 - grid[i - 1][j - 1]

    return affected <= half_size

# Initialize solution variables
N1 = 0
wrong_helicopters = []

# Iterate through helicopters and apply checks
for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, 1):
    if helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p):
        N1 += 1
    else:
        wrong_helicopters.append(idx)

# Write results to file
with open('elicop.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N1}\n")
    file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")
```

The above solution utilizes built-in Python data types and functionalities to ensure it runs in an environment without external libraries. It reads the input from a file, processes the helicopter landings, and writes the output to another file as required.

Upon reviewing the expected and found output, it is clear that the results differ because the code is incorrectly counting helicopters that do not affect any shaded squares as well as incorrectly identifying helicopters that landed wrongly. The original condition for checking if a helicopter landed correctly is flawed because it does not accurately count the shaded squares within the triangle area.

To fix the issue, I need to correct the `helicopter_landed_correctly` function to ensure that it properly counts the shaded squares within the isosceles right triangle formed by each helicopter. Below, I have rewritten the solution to properly handle the logic for determining whether helicopters have landed correctly or not.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('elicop.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Auxiliary function to check if the helicopter landed correctly
def helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p):
    L1, L2 = min(L1, L2), max(L1, L2)
    C1, C2 = min(C1, C2), max(C1, C2)
    size = (L2 - L1 + 1)
    half_size = size * (size + 1) // 4
    affected = 0

    for i in range(L2 - L1 + 1):
        for j in range(C2 - C1 + 1):
            if p == -1:
                if i <= j:
                    affected += 1 - grid[L1 - 1 + i][C1 - 1 + j]
            else:
                if i + j < size - 1:
                    affected += 1 - grid[L1 - 1 + i][C1 - 1 + j]

    return affected <= half_size

# Initialize solution variables
N1 = 0
wrong_helicopters = []

# Iterate through helicopters and apply checks
for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, 1):
    if helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p):
        N1 += 1
    else:
        wrong_helicopters.append(idx)

# Write results to file
with open('elicop.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N1}\n")
    file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")
```

The corrected `helicopter_landed_correctly` function now accurately checks the triangle area beneath each helicopter, considering the orientation of the triangle (whether the right-angle vertex is above or below the hypotenuse). The rest of the algorithm remains the same but will now produce the correct output given the input data.

The issue appears to be with the incorrect counting of shaded squares within the triangle area of each helicopter. Looking at the expected output, it is clear that helicopters 1 and 3 have landed incorrectly (over half of their triangle areas are shaded), while the expected number of helicopters that did not affect any squares is 2. The function `helicopter_landed_correctly` needs to correctly count the shaded squares in the triangle area to determine if the landing is wrong.

The implementation of the function `helicopter_landed_correctly` should precisely map out the triangle area for each helicopter, taking into account the helicopter's orientation and only counting shaded squares within that triangle. The count of shaded squares within the triangle area should then be compared to half of the triangle area to determine if the landing is wrong.

Let's rewrite the function and the solution to fix the bug:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('elicop.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Auxiliary function to check if the helicopter landed correctly
def helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p):
    L1, L2 = min(L1, L2), max(L1, L2)
    C1, C2 = min(C1, C2), max(C1, C2)
    affected = 0
    total = 0

    if p == -1:
        for i in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for j in range(C1, C1 + L2 - i + 1):
                total += 1
                if grid[i - 1][j - 1] == 0:
                    affected += 1
    else:
        for i in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for j in range(C2 - (i - L1), C2 + 1):
                total += 1
                if grid[i - 1][j - 1] == 0:
                    affected += 1

    return affected <= total // 2, total == affected

# Initialize solution variables
N1 = 0
wrong_helicopters = []

# Iterate through helicopters and apply checks
for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, 1):
    correct, no_effect = helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p)
    if no_effect:
        N1 += 1
    elif not correct:
        wrong_helicopters.append(idx)

# Write results to file
with open('elicop.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N1}\n")
    file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")
```

This updated solution correctly counts the shaded squares within the triangle area and compares it to half the total number of squares in the triangle to determine if more than half are shaded. It also checks if no squares are affected for the N1 count. This should now match the expected output.

The error in the previous solutions seems to come from the incorrect calculation of the triangles and their affected squares. The logic to determine if a helicopter has landed correctly or not is not giving the expected results. The previous solutions also did not differentiate between helicopters that did not affect any squares and those that have landed correctly, but affect some squares.

Let's correct this by rewriting the code, specifically focusing on correctly identifying the triangles and counting the affected squares.

```python
# Read data from file
with open('elicop.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Check each helicopter
N1 = 0  # Number of helicopters not affecting any squares
wrong_helicopters = []  # Indices of helicopters that landed wrongly

for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
    # Determine the direction of the helicopter's triangle
    delta_row = 1 if L2 > L1 else -1
    delta_col = 1 if C2 > C1 else -1

    # Calculate affected squares and the size of the triangle
    affected = 0
    size = abs(L2 - L1)
    total_squares = (size * (size + 1)) // 2

    # Iterate over the triangle's squares
    for i in range(size + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            row = L1 - 1 + i * delta_row if p == -1 else L1 - 1 + (size - i) * delta_row
            col = C1 - 1 + j * delta_col
            if grid[row][col] == 0:  # Affected by shadow
                affected += 1

    if affected == 0:
        N1 += 1
    elif affected > total_squares // 2:
        wrong_helicopters.append(idx)

# Write results to file
with open('elicop.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N1}\n")
    file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")
```

This revised program takes a different approach:

1. It calculates the direction of iteration based on the input coordinates of the hypotenuse.
2. It iterates over the number of rows `size + 1` and over the number of squares in each row `i + 1`.
3. It checks if each square in the triangle is affected by the shadow.
4. It differentiates helicopters that do not affect any squares (N1) from those that have more than half their squares affected (wrong_helicopters).

This solution should be able to compute the correct output for the given input data.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output suggests that there is a bug in the logic that determines whether a helicopter has landed without affecting any shaded squares (N1). The value of N1 found by the previous code was 1, whereas the expected value is 2. This indicates that there is at least one helicopter that has been incorrectly classified.

Let's re-evaluate the code logic and correct any issues related to the calculation of affected squares within the triangle area:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('elicop.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Auxiliary function to check if the helicopter landed correctly
def helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p):
    affected = 0  # Count of shaded squares
    total = 0  # Total number of squares in the triangle
    clear = True  # Flag to check if no squares are shaded

    if p == -1:
        for r in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for c in range(C1, C1 + r - L1 + 1):
                total += 1
                if grid[r - 1][c - 1] == 0:
                    affected += 1
                    clear = False
    else:  # p == 1
        for r in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for c in range(C2 - (r - L1), C2 + 1):
                total += 1
                if grid[r - 1][c - 1] == 0:
                    affected += 1
                    clear = False

    return affected <= total // 2, clear

# Initialize solution variables
N1 = 0
wrong_helicopters = []

# Iterate through helicopters and apply checks
for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
    correct_landing, no_shaded_squares = helicopter_landed_correctly(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p)
    if no_shaded_squares:
        N1 += 1
    elif not correct_landing:
        wrong_helicopters.append(idx)

# Write results to file
with open('elicop.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N1}\n")
    file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")
```

In this revised code:

1. We check each helicopter's triangle to see if it contains any shaded squares. If a helicopter's triangle contains no shaded squares, we increment N1.
2. We also check if a helicopter has landed incorrectly by having more than half of its triangle's squares shaded.
3. We differentiate between a clear landing (no shaded squares) and a correct landing (not more than half shaded squares).
4. We use a flag `clear` to determine if any shaded squares are present within the triangle.

This solution should now correctly identify the helicopters that landed without affecting any shaded squares and those that have landed incorrectly, outputting the expected results.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests that the logic for counting the affected squares within the helicopter's landing triangle is incorrect. The previous code incorrectly counts the number of helicopters that landed without affecting any squares and also incorrectly identifies helicopters that landed wrongly.

To address this, I will rewrite the logic to correctly identify the triangles and count the affected squares, ensuring:

1. The triangle area is correctly determined based on the helicopter's orientation (i.e., whether the hypotenuse is above or below the triangle).
2. The shaded squares are correctly counted within the triangle area.
3. Helicopters that affect no squares are counted separately from those that land correctly but do affect some squares.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('elicop.in', 'r') as file:
    m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
    grid = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    helicopters = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

def count_affected_squares(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p, m, n):
    # Calculate size of the triangle side (equal for both sides in an isosceles right triangle)
    size = abs(L2 - L1) + 1
    affected = 0
    clear = True
    total_squares = (size * size) // 2  # Total squares in the triangle
    
    # Find the orientation of the triangle and count affected squares
    if p == 1:  # Hypotenuse is on the bottom
        for i in range(size):
            for j in range(i + 1):
                if grid[L1 - 1 + i][C1 - 1 - j] == 0:
                    affected += 1
                    clear = False
    else:  # Hypotenuse is on the top
        for i in range(size):
            for j in range(size - i):
                if grid[L1 - 1 + i][C1 - 1 + j] == 0:
                    affected += 1
                    clear = False
                
    return affected, clear, total_squares

# Initialize solution variables
N1 = 0
wrong_helicopters = []

# Process each helicopter
for index, (L1, C1, L2, C2, p) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
    if L2 < L1:  # Ensure L1 is the smaller (uppermost) index
        L1, L2 = L2, L1
    if C2 > C1:  # Ensure C1 is the smaller (leftmost) index
        C1, C2 = C2, C1
        
    affected, clear, total_squares = count_affected_squares(grid, L1, C1, L2, C2, p, m, n)
    
    if clear:
        N1 += 1
    elif affected > total_squares // 2:
        wrong_helicopters.append(index)

# Write results to file
with open('elicop.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{N1}\n")
    file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopters)} {' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters))}\n")
```

This solution maintains the hypotenuse orientation and counts the number of affected squares correctly by iterating over the triangle in the right direction. It accounts for both helicopters that don't affect any squares (N1) and those that land incorrectly (more than half their squares are shaded). The solution should now produce the expected output for the given input data.
