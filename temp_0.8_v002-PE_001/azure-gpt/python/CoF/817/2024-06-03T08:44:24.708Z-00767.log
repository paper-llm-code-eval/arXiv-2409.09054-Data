Un teren de fotbal este folosit pentru aterizarea elicopterelor. Gazonul de pe stadion este parcelat în pătrăţele de aceeaşi dimensiune, cu laturile paralele cu marginile terenului. Liniile cu pătrăţele de gazon sunt numerotate de sus în jos cu numerele $1, 2, \dots, m$, iar coloanele cu pătrăţele de gazon sunt numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numerele $1, 2, \dots, n$. Din cauza tipului diferit de iarbă se ştie care dintre pătrăţele de gazon sunt afectate sau nu de umbră. Acest lucru este precizat printr-un tablou bidimensional $a$ cu $m$ linii şi $n$ coloane, cu elemente $0$ şi $1$ ($a_{ij} = 0$ înseamnă că pătrăţelul aflat pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$ este afectat de umbră, iar $a_{ij} = 1$ înseamnă că pătrăţelul aflat pe linia $i$ şi coloana $j$ nu este afectat de umbră). Fiecare elicopter are $3$ roţi pe care se sprijină. Roţile fiecărui elicopter determină un triunghi dreptunghic isoscel. Elicopterele aterizează, astfel încât triunghiurile formate să fie cu catetele paralele cu marginile terenului. În exemplul următor avem patru elicoptere.

~[elicop.png|width=30em]

Pentru a preciza poziţia unui elicopter pe teren este suficient să cunoaştem linia şi coloana vărfurilor ipotenuzei şi poziţia vârfului deasupra (codificată prin $1$) sau dedesubtul ipotenuzei (codificată prin $-1$). Pentru exemplu, elicopterul din stânga sus este dat prin $(1, 1), (3, 3)$ şi $-1$, cel din dreapta sus prin $(1, 9), (5, 5)$ şi $1$, cel din stânga jos prin $(5, 1), (6, 2)$ şi $1$, iar cel din dreapta jos prin $(5, 9), (6, 8)$ şi $1$.
Un elicopter se consideră că a aterizat *greşit*, dacă triunghiul format sub el (definit mai sus) are mai mult de jumătate din pătrăţele afectate de umbră.
Administratorul terenului de fotbal doreşte să determine numărul $N_1$ de elicoptere, care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren şi numerele de ordine al elicopterelor, care au aterizat *greşit* în ordine crescătoare: $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$, ştiind că există $k$ elicoptere codificate prin numerele $1, 2, \dots, k$.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care să determine, pentru fişierul cu datele din enunţ: numărul de elicoptere $N_1$, care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren şi numerele de ordine al elicopterelor, care au aterizat *greşit* în ordine crescătoare, precedate de numărul lor $N_2$.

# Date de intrare


Prima linie a fişierului de intrare `elicop.in` conţine două numere naturale $m$ şi $n$, separate printr-un spaţiu, cu semnificaţia din enunţ. Următoarele $m$ linii conţin câte $n$ numere $0$ sau $1$, separate prin câte un spaţiu cu semnificaţia $0$ – pătrăţel de gazon care este afectat de umbră, respectiv $1$ - pătrăţel care nu este afectat de umbră. Pe linia $m+2$ se află numărul de elicoptere $k$, iar pe următoarele $k$ linii (în ordinea codificării lor $1, 2, \dots, k$) câte cinci numere separate prin cate un spaţiu, pentru liniile şi coloanele ipotenuzelor şi poziţia vârfului ($1$ sau $-1$), triunghiurilor dreptunghice asociate elicopterelor: $L_1 \ C_1 \ L_2 \ C_2 \ p$.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul de ieşire `elicop.out` va conţine două linii: prima linie numărul $N_1$ de elicoptere, pe care nu afectează nici un pătrăţel din teren, a doua linie cu numerele naturale $N_2, e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$ separate prin câte un spaţiu, în ordine crescătoare.


# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq m, n \leq 100$
* $1 \leq k \leq 40$
* Nu există suprapuneri de triunghiuri asociate la două elicoptere.
* Triunghiurile asociate elicopterelor conţin cel puţin trei pătrăţele.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a valorilor $N_1$ se obţine $40$% din punctajul unui test, iar pentru determinarea corectă a valorilor $N_2, e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{N_2}$ se obţine $60$% din punctajul unui test.

The error you encountered indicates that the `numpy` library is not installed in your environment. Since we have strict memory constraints and we are dealing with small matrices (maximum size 100x100), we can avoid using `numpy` and use pure Python to handle the matrix operations.

Here is the updated solution using built-in Python lists instead:

```python
# elicoptere.py
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grass_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline())
        helicopters = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
        
    return m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters

def check_helicopter(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position):
    affected = 0
    total = 0
    if position == 1:
        for i in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for j in range(C1, C1 + (i - L1) + 1):
                affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
                total += 1
    else:
        for i in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for j in range(C2 - (i - L1), C2 + 1):
                affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
                total += 1
    return total, affected

def write_output(file_path, N1, N2, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        file.write(f"{N2}" if N2 > 0 else "0")
        if N2 > 0:
            file.write(" " + ' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters)))
        file.write("\n")

def main():
    m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1 = 0
    N2 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []
    
    for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, position) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
        total, affected = check_helicopter(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position)
        if affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        elif affected > total // 2:
            N2 += 1
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)
            
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, N2, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run this code, ensure you have the `elicop.in` file with the example input provided in the challenge in the same directory. The code will then read the input, process it according to the problem description, and write the results to `elicop.out`.

The `IndexError: list index out of range` error indicates that the code is trying to access an index in the `grass_matrix` list that does not exist. This might be happening because the `check_helicopter` function is not correctly handling the boundaries of the matrix, especially when calculating the indices for the triangles.

I will correct the indexing within the `check_helicopter` function to ensure it properly checks the bounds of the matrix, and I will also include some checks to prevent accessing indices out of range.

Here is the updated and corrected solution:

```python
# elicoptere.py
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:

                    affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
                    total += 1
    else:

            for j in range(C2 - (i - L1), C2 + 1):
                if 0 <= i - 1 < m and 0 <= j - 1 < n:
                    affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
                    total += 1
    return total, affected

        if N2 > 0:
            file.write(" " + ' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters)))
        file.write("\n")

def main():

        if total > 0 and affected == 0:

        elif total > 0 and affected > total // 2:

The discrepancy between the expected and found result suggests that there might be a bug in the way we are counting the helicopters that have landed correctly (without affecting any grass) and those that have landed incorrectly (affecting more than half of the grass). I will re-evaluate the `check_helicopter` function logic.

Upon reviewing the logic, I noticed that the indices we are using to iterate over the matrix might be incorrect, especially considering the `-1` position which indicates that the triangle's right-angle vertex is below the hypotenuse. I'll need to adjust the range of the loops to ensure they accurately represent the triangle's area for both positions.

Let's correct the code:

```python
# elicoptere.py
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grass_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline())
        helicopters = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

    return m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters

def check_helicopter(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position):
    affected = 0
    total = 0
    if position == 1:  # top-right triangle
        for i in range(L1 - 1, L2):
            for j in range(C1 - 1, C1 - 1 + i - L1 + 1):
                affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i][j]
                total += 1
    else:  # bottom-left triangle
        for i in range(L1 - 1, L2):
            for j in range(C2 - 1 - (i - L1), C2):
                affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i][j]
                total += 1
    return total, affected

def write_output(file_path, N1, N2, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        if N2 > 0:
            file.write(f"{N2} " + ' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters)) + "\n")
        else:
            file.write("0\n")

def main():
    m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []

    for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, position) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
        total, affected = check_helicopter(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position)
        if affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        elif affected > total // 2:
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)

    N2 = len(wrong_helicopters)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, N2, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This refactored code corrects the loops' ranges to properly represent the area of the triangles for both positions of the vertex. It also simplifies the output by managing the count of wrong helicopters directly with the length of the `wrong_helicopters` list.

Make sure the `elicop.in` file is correctly formatted according to the problem specification and is placed in the same directory as the script before running the code. The script reads the input from `elicop.in` and writes the output to `elicop.out`.

The error indicates that the program is once again trying to access an index in the `grass_matrix` list that does not exist. To ensure that we are not going out of the matrix boundaries, we must carefully define the ranges for `i` and `j` within the `check_helicopter` function, taking into account the size of the football field (`m` and `n`).

I will fix the code by adding appropriate checks for the boundaries and correcting the iteration ranges:

```python

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())

This code has been updated to ensure that the iteration through the helicopter's covering area on the grass matrix does not exceed its boundaries. It also simplifies the output process by using the length of the `wrong_helicopters` list to determine the value of `N2`.

Make sure that the `elicop.in` file is in the same directory as this script and that it is formatted according to the input specifications of the problem. When executed, the script will read from `elicop.in` and write the results to `elicop.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results suggests a logical error in the `check_helicopter` function. The function might not be correctly determining the helicopters that have landed incorrectly (affecting more than half of the grass squares). My previous correction assumed that the range check was the issue, but it appears that the logic for determining the affected squares is incorrect.

The `check_helicopter` function should correctly compute the number of grass squares that are not affected by shadow for each helicopter's landing area. Additionally, it should determine whether more than half of the squares in the landing area are affected by shadow. If more than half of the squares are affected, the helicopter has landed incorrectly. 

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grass_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline())
        helicopters = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]
    return m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters

def count_affected_grass(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position):
    affected_count = 0
    not_affected_count = 0
    if position == 1:  # The vertex is above the hypotenuse
        for i in range(L1 - 1, L2):
            for j in range(C1 + (i - L1), C2 + 1):
                if grass_matrix[i][j] == 1:
                    not_affected_count += 1
                else:
                    affected_count += 1
    else:  # The vertex is below the hypotenuse
        for i in range(L1 - 1, L2):
            for j in range(C1 - (i - L1) - 1, C1):
                if grass_matrix[i][j] == 1:
                    not_affected_count += 1
                else:
                    affected_count += 1
    return not_affected_count, affected_count

def write_output(file_path, N1, wrong_helicopter_indices):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        file.write(f"{len(wrong_helicopter_indices)}")
        if wrong_helicopter_indices:
            file.write(" " + " ".join(map(str, wrong_helicopter_indices)))
        file.write("\n")

def main():
    m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1 = 0
    wrong_helicopter_indices = []
    for index, (L1, C1, L2, C2, position) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
        not_affected, affected = count_affected_grass(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position)
        total = not_affected + affected
        if affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        elif affected > total / 2:
            wrong_helicopter_indices.append(index)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, wrong_helicopter_indices)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated solution changes the approach to computing affected and not affected squares within the `count_affected_grass` function, taking care to handle both cases of the vertex position correctly. It ensures that the entire area within the triangle is iterated over and that each square is checked for being affected by shadow. The output is written in the specified format, and `N1` is now accurately counting helicopters that do not affect any grass squares.

Please ensure the `elicop.in` file is in the same directory as this script and formatted as per the input specifications. When the script is executed, it will read from `elicop.in` and write the results to `elicop.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates there's still an error in the logic for checking the helicopter landing positions. It appears the code is not correctly identifying all the helicopters that have landed incorrectly. 

In particular, the logic for counting the affected and not affected grass squares needs to be revised to ensure it's accurately determining when more than half of the squares are affected by shadow. Also, the expected output suggests that there are two helicopters that have landed incorrectly, but the program only found one.

Upon reviewing the logic again, I realized the error is with how the triangles are being traversed. The iteration ranges for the triangles were incorrect in both cases where the vertex is above and below the hypotenuse. 

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# elicoptere.py
def read_input(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        m, n = map(int, file.readline().split())
        grass_matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        k = int(file.readline())
        helicopters = [list(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

    return m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters

def check_helicopter(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position, m, n):
    affected = 0
    total = 0
    if position == -1:  # Vertex is below the hypotenuse
        for i in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for j in range(C1, C1 + (i - L1) + 1):
                if 0 <= i - 1 < m and 0 <= j - 1 < n:
                    affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
                    total += 1
    else:  # Vertex is above the hypotenuse
        for i in range(L1, L2 + 1):
            for j in range(C2 - (i - L1), C2 + 1):
                if 0 <= i - 1 < m and 0 <= j - 1 < n:
                    affected += 1 - grass_matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
                    total += 1
    return total, affected

def write_output(file_path, N1, N2, wrong_helicopters):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{N1}\n")
        file.write(f"{N2}")
        if N2 > 0:
            file.write(" " + ' '.join(map(str, wrong_helicopters)))
        file.write("\n")

def main():
    m, n, grass_matrix, k, helicopters = read_input('elicop.in')
    N1 = 0
    wrong_helicopters = []

    for idx, (L1, C1, L2, C2, position) in enumerate(helicopters, start=1):
        total, affected = check_helicopter(grass_matrix, L1, C1, L2, C2, position, m, n)
        if total > 0 and affected == 0:
            N1 += 1
        elif total > 0 and affected > total // 2:
            wrong_helicopters.append(idx)

    N2 = len(wrong_helicopters)
    write_output('elicop.out', N1, N2, wrong_helicopters)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code ensures that the traversal of the helicopter's landing area is correct by flipping the iteration ranges for the triangles based on the vertex's position relative to the hypotenuse. The output logic has been adjusted to match the expected format.

Make sure that `elicop.in` is in the same directory as this script and is formatted in accordance with the problem's input specifications. Upon execution, the script will read from `elicop.in` and write the results to `elicop.out`.
