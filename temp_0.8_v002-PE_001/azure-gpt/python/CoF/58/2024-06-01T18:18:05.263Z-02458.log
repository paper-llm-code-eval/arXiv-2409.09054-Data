În faţa palatului Prinţesei Mofturoase se află $N$ peţitori aşezaţi la coadă, unul în spatele celuilalt. Fiecare poartă sub mantie un număr de pietre preţioase pe care doreşte să le ofere prinţesei ca dar de nuntă. Pentru a nu semăna vrajbă în rândurile lor, prinţesa a decis să-i determine ca $N-1$ dintre ei să renunţe în chip paşnic, peţitorul rămas devenind alesul prinţesei (indiferent de numărul de pietre preţioase deţinute de acesta).

Doi peţitori vecini la coadă se pot înţelege între ei astfel: cel care are mai puţine pietre preţioase pleacă de la coadă primind de la celălalt un număr de pietre astfel încât să plece acasă cu un număr dublu de pietre faţă de câte avea. Dacă doi peţitori au acelaşi număr de pietre, unul din ei (nu contează care) pleacă luând toate pietrele vecinului său. 

Un peţitor se poate înţelege la un moment dat cu unul singur dintre cei doi vecini ai săi. După plecarea unui peţitor, toţi cei din spatele lui avansează.

De exemplu: pentru configuraţia alăturată de $5$ peţitori, un şir posibil de negocieri care conduc la reducerea cozii la un singur peţitor este: se înţeleg vecinii $4$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $4$, se înţeleg apoi $1$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $1$, se înţeleg apoi $3$ cu $2$ şi pleacă $3$, se înţeleg $2$ cu $5$ şi pleacă $5$. Astfel peţitorul $2$ câştigă mâna preafrumoasei prinţese, oferindu-i $0$ pietre preţioase ca dar de nuntă.

# Cerință
Fie $P$ numarul de pietre preţioase pe care le are peţitorul care va deveni alesul prinţesei. Se cer valorile distincte ale lui $P$ la care se poate ajunge prin toate succesiunile de negocieri posibile.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `nunta.in` conţine: 
- pe prima linie numărul de peţitori: $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 50$). 
- pe a doua linie, $n$ numere naturale din intervalul $[0, 20]$, reprezentând numărul de pietre preţioase pe care le deţin peţitorii, în ordinea în care stau la coadă. 

# Date de ieșire
Fişierul de ieşire `nunta.out` va conţine:
- pe prima linie  numărul $m$ de valori distincte ce pot fi obţinute
- pe a doua linie cele $m$ valori ordonate crescător, reprezentând valorile care se pot obţine.

                new_petitors = np.delete(petitors, min_index)
                new_petitors[min_index] += petitors[min_index]
                negotiate(new_petitors, max(min_index - 1, 0))

        else:
            # If we have reached the end of the array, we add the remaining value to the set
            possible_values.add(petitors[-1])

    # Starting negotiation from the first petitor
    negotiate(petitors, 0)

    return sorted(list(possible_values))

# Read from nunta.in
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitors = np.array(list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())), dtype=int)

with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(len(values)) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, values)) + '\n')
```
```

This code defines a function `calculate_possible_values` that computes all possible outcomes for the final petitor's stones through recursive negotiation. It reads the number of petitors and the amount of gems each one has from `nunta.in` and writes the number of different possible values for P and the ordered unique values to `nunta.out`. The numpy library is used to manipulate arrays more efficiently, and the set is used to store unique values to eliminate duplicates automatically. The recursive function `negotiate` handles the logic of the petitors giving stones to each other according to the rules provided.

It appears that the error is due to the `numpy` library not being installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the challenge specifies optimizing for both time and memory and suggests using efficient libraries, the use of `numpy` was appropriate.

However, since the environment does not have `numpy` installed, and we are working under constraints of not using such libraries, we need to rewrite the solution without relying on `numpy`. This can be done using standard Python lists and sets. Here is the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Function to calculate all possible outcomes for P using standard Python lists
def calculate_possible_values(petitors):
    possible_values = set()

    # Recursive function to handle the negotiation between petitors
    def negotiate(petitors):
        if len(petitors) == 1:
            possible_values.add(petitors[0])
        else:
            for i in range(len(petitors) - 1):
                # If the two petitors have the same number of gems
                if petitors[i] == petitors[i + 1]:
                    # They merge, and one is removed
                    new_petitors = petitors[:i] + [petitors[i] * 2] + petitors[i+2:]
                    negotiate(new_petitors)
                else:
                    # Negotiate with both possible outcomes
                    if petitors[i] < petitors[i + 1]:
                        new_petitors = petitors[:i] + [petitors[i] * 2] + petitors[i+1:]
                    else:
                        new_petitors = petitors[:i+1] + [petitors[i+1] * 2] + petitors[i+2:]
                    negotiate(new_petitors)
                    
                    # Switch the one that leaves
                    new_petitors = petitors[:i] + petitors[i+1:]
                    negotiate(new_petitors)

    negotiate(petitors)
    return sorted(list(possible_values))

# Read data from nunta.in
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitors = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the possible values for P
values = calculate_possible_values(petitors)

# Write the results to nunta.out
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(values)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, values)) + '\n')
```

This version should work without any additional libraries and respects the memory constraints of the challenge.

The error indicates that the maximum recursion depth has been exceeded. This means the recursive `negotiate` function is calling itself too many times without reaching a base case, which can happen if there is a logical error in the recursive step or if the problem is simply too deep for Python's default recursion limit.

In the given code, the recursion logic seems to be correct since we are reducing the size of the `petitors` list on each recursive call. However, it is possible that the depth of recursion is too large for Python's default recursion limit, especially if the number of petitors is high and there are many possible ways to negotiate.

To fix this, we can try using an iterative approach instead of a recursive one, which should avoid hitting the recursion limit. Here is the updated solution using an iterative approach:

```python
# Function to calculate all possible outcomes for P using an iterative approach
def calculate_possible_values(petitors):
    possible_values = set()
    scenarios = [petitors]

    while scenarios:
        current_scenario = scenarios.pop()
        if len(current_scenario) == 1:
            possible_values.add(current_scenario[0])
        else:
            for i in range(len(current_scenario) - 1):
                if current_scenario[i] == current_scenario[i + 1]:
                    # Merge the two petitors with equal gems
                    new_scenario = current_scenario[:i] + [current_scenario[i] * 2] + current_scenario[i+2:]
                    scenarios.append(new_scenario)
                else:
                    # The one with fewer gems leaves with double the amount
                    if current_scenario[i] < current_scenario[i + 1]:
                        new_scenario = current_scenario[:i] + [current_scenario[i] * 2] + current_scenario[i+1:]
                    else:
                        new_scenario = current_scenario[:i+1] + [current_scenario[i+1] * 2] + current_scenario[i+2:]
                    scenarios.append(new_scenario)
                    
                    # Remove the petitor with fewer gems
                    new_scenario = current_scenario[:i] + current_scenario[i+1:]
                    scenarios.append(new_scenario)

    return sorted(list(possible_values))

# Read data from nunta.in
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitors = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the possible values for P
values = calculate_possible_values(petitors)

# Write the results to nunta.out
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(values)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, values)) + '\n')
```

This version of the code uses an iterative approach to manage the scenarios and avoid recursion altogether. It uses a stack (the list `scenarios`) to keep track of all the scenarios that need to be processed, which should circumvent the issue of hitting the recursion limit.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the program was killed because it exceeded available memory resources. This is consistent with the challenge's memory constraint of ~8MB. The iterative approach has resulted in too many scenarios being stored in the list, leading to excessive memory usage.

Given the memory constraints and potential complexity of the problem, we need to re-evaluate our approach to be more memory efficient. One possible solution is to use a depth-first search (DFS) approach and generate the scenarios on the fly without storing them all at once. This can be more memory-efficient since it handles one path through the scenario tree at a time.

Here's the updated solution using an iterative DFS with a stack that should be more memory-efficient:

```python
# Function to calculate all possible outcomes for P using DFS
def calculate_possible_values(petitors):
    possible_values = set()

    # Initialize the stack with the initial petitors list
    stack = [(petitors, 0)]

    while stack:
        current_scenario, start = stack.pop()

        if len(current_scenario) == 1:
            possible_values.add(current_scenario[0])
            continue

        for i in range(start, len(current_scenario) - 1):
            if current_scenario[i] == current_scenario[i + 1]:
                new_scenario = current_scenario[:i] + [current_scenario[i] * 2] + current_scenario[i+2:]
                stack.append((new_scenario, i))
                break
            else:
                new_scenario_less = current_scenario[:i] + [current_scenario[i] * 2] + current_scenario[i+1:]
                new_scenario_more = current_scenario[:i+1] + [current_scenario[i+1] * 2] + current_scenario[i+2:]
                stack.append((new_scenario_less, i))
                stack.append((new_scenario_more, i + 1))
                break

    return sorted(list(possible_values))

# Read data from nunta.in
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitors = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the possible values for P
values = calculate_possible_values(petitors)

# Write the results to nunta.out
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(values)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, values)) + '\n')
```

In this version, the stack is used to keep track of the current scenario and the next starting point to reduce duplications while exploring the next step in the scenario tree. We avoid pushing multiple scenarios at once by breaking the loop after pushing a new scenario, meaning we only deal with one scenario at a time. This should significantly reduce memory usage while still exploring all possible scenarios.

Given that the program still exits with code 137, it seems that memory constraints are still a significant issue even after attempting an iterative DFS approach. Since the problem specifies a very tight memory limit, the challenge may require a more analytical solution that avoids enumerating all possible negotiation sequences.

To address this, we need to think about the properties of the negotiation process:

1. If any two adjacent petitors have the same number of stones, they will combine, and the count will be doubled.
2. If adjacent petitors have different stone counts, one will leave with double their stones, and the other will stay without any change.

A key insight is that any larger number will always "absorb" smaller or equal numbers to its right until it encounters a larger number. This is because the smaller or equal right neighbor will either combine with it (if equal) or leave with double (if smaller), and the larger number will remain. This process can be visualized as a "wave" moving from left to right, stopping when it reaches a larger number.

By applying this insight, we can create a solution that processes the petitors from right to left, determining which petitors will end up as the "dominant" one for each position and which values are possible for the last remaining petitor.

Here's the code for this revised approach:

```python
# Read data from nunta.in
with open('nunta.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    petitors = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Function to calculate all possible outcomes for P using analytical approach
def calculate_possible_values(petitors):
    possible_values = set()
    max_so_far = 0

    # Process petitors from right to left
    for i in range(len(petitors) - 1, -1, -1):
        if petitors[i] >= max_so_far:
            # If the current petitor has more or equal stones than any seen so far,
            # it can potentially be the last one remaining
            possible_values.add(petitors[i])
            max_so_far = petitors[i]
        else:
            # If the current petitor has fewer stones, it will leave with double
            # unless it encounters a larger number to its left first
            potential_value = petitors[i] * 2
            while potential_value <= max_so_far:
                potential_value *= 2
            max_so_far = potential_value
            possible_values.add(potential_value)

    return sorted(list(possible_values))

# Calculate the possible values for P
values = calculate_possible_values(petitors)

# Write the results to nunta.out
with open('nunta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{len(values)}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, values)) + '\n')
```

In this version of the code, by not storing intermediate scenarios and instead processing the petitors to find the resulting values directly, we should significantly reduce the memory footprint, hopefully staying within the ~8MB limit.

The issue with the previous attempt is that it incorrectly calculates the potential values for the last remaining petitor. The logic used in that attempt failed to account for the possibility that a smaller number could become the final number after all negotiations are completed. A smaller number could potentially double enough times to outlast any larger numbers to its left if those larger numbers are absorbed by even larger numbers further to the left.

Let's try again with a different approach. We can simulate the process using an algorithm that iterates over the petitors, simulating each possible negotiation without the need to store every intermediate state.

Here's the code for the corrected approach:

```python
# Read data from nunta.in

This updated solution uses recursion to simulate the negotiation process, making sure to explore all possible negotiation outcomes. When two adjacent petitors have the same number of stones, they will combine, and when they have different numbers, each possibility (one of the petitors leaving) is explored. This should give us the correct set of possible outcomes, which we then write to "nunta.out".
