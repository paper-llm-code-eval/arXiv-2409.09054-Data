Ionuţ pleacă în drumeţie într-o porţiune de teren de formă pătratică cu latura de $N$ metri. O hartă a zonei are trasat un caroiaj care împarte zona în $N \cdot N$ pătrate unitate, cu latura de $1$ metru. Astfel harta zonei are aspectul unui tablou pătratic cu $N$ linii şi $N$ coloane. Liniile şi coloanele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $N$. Elementele tabloului bidimensional corespund pătratelor unitate. Zona poate fi parcursă străbătând oricare dintre laturile pătratelor unitate **cel mult o singură dată**.

~[55bdc2f5c84ca3f4b5a80867350d0328.png]

Ionuţ pleacă din punctul aflat în colţul din dreapta jos al pătratului unitate din linia $X$, coloana $Y$ şi se deplasează făcând **un pas** (parcurgând o latură a unui pătrat unitate) în una din direcţiile $Nord$, $Est$, $Sud$, $Vest$. Pentru a reţine mai uşor traseul foloseşte următoarea codificare pentru cele $4$ direcţii: $1$ pentru deplasarea spre $Nord$, $2$ pentru deplasarea spre $Est$, $3$ pentru deplasarea spre $Sud$, respectiv $4$ pentru deplasarea spre $Vest$. Ajuns într-alt punct (colţ de pătrat unitate), Ionuţ continuă să se deplaseze fără a trece de mai multe ori pe aceeaşi latură a unui pătrat unitate. 

Ionuţ se opreşte în momentul în care ajunge într-un punct prin care a mai trecut. Traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct delimitează o zonă de teren formată din pătrate unitate.

# Cerinţă

Dându-se linia $X$ şi coloana $Y$ corespunzătoare poziţiei de plecare a lui Ionuţ, dimensiunea zonei $N$, lungimea traseului $L$ şi traseul determinaţi:

$a)$ Numărul de paşi parcurşi între prima şi a doua trecere prin punctul de oprire.
$b)$ Numărul de pătrate unitate interioare zonei delimitată de traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct.  


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `zona.in` se află valorile $X$, $Y$, $N$ şi $L$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctului de plecare, dimensiunea terenului şi lungimea traseului parcurs. Pe următoarea linie se află $L$ valori din mulţimea $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând codificarea întregului traseu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `zona.out` va conţine **două** linii, pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $a)$, iar pe linia a doua, un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < N < 51$
* $0 < X, Y < N$
* $0 < L < 2501$
* Se garantează faptul că traseul trece de două ori prin acelaşi punct şi nu parcurge de două ori aceeaşi latură.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $a)$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $b)$ se acordă $80\%$ din punctaj.

    path = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize the grid
grid = np.zeros((N + 2, N + 2), dtype=np.int8)  # Using int8 to save memory, adding border to avoid bounds checking

# Calculate steps before revisiting the starting point
steps_revisited = calculate_steps_revisited(X, Y, path[:L])

# Write output data
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:

```

This solution makes use of numpy for efficient array representation and manipulation while also being careful with memory usage by using `dtype=np.int8` for the grid. The grid has been padded with a border to avoid bounds checking during the area calculation. The calculations for the steps and area are split into two separate functions for clarity and modularity.

The program exited with code 1 because the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the requirement is to optimize both time and memory usage and to keep the memory limit around 8MB, it may be better to avoid using `numpy` or any other external libraries that could potentially consume more memory, and instead, use only built-in Python data structures and functionalities.

Let's rewrite the entire solution using built-in Python data structures and functionalities:

```python
# Define the direction vectors for NESW
DIRECTIONS = [(0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0)]

# Read input data from file
with open('zona.in', 'r') as file:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())
    path = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Grid to mark visited points
# Initialize the grid with False, indicating that no points have been visited
visited = [[False for _ in range(N + 2)] for _ in range(N + 2)]

# Mark the borders of the grid as visited to prevent walking off the grid
for i in range(N + 2):
    visited[0][i] = visited[N + 1][i] = visited[i][0] = visited[i][N + 1] = True

# Start walking the path starting from (X, Y)
steps = 0
area = 0
x, y = X, Y
visited[x][y] = True  # Mark the starting point as visited

# Walk the path until the starting point is revisited
for move in path:
    dx, dy = DIRECTIONS[move - 1]
    x += dx
    y += dy
    steps += 1

    # Check if the moved position is visited
    if visited[x][y]:
        # Calculate the enclosed area
        # BFS or DFS could be used here to calculate the area
        to_visit = [(x, y)]
        while to_visit:
            cx, cy = to_visit.pop()
            for d in DIRECTIONS:
                nx, ny = cx + d[0], cy + d[1]
                if not visited[nx][ny]:
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    area += 1
                    to_visit.append((nx, ny))
        break  # Exit the loop after revisiting the start

    visited[x][y] = True  # Mark the new position as visited

# Write output data to file
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{steps}\n{area}\n")
```

The rewritten solution uses a 2D list (`visited`) to keep track of visited points and the borders of the grid. Instead of using `numpy`, it uses a list comprehension to initialize the visited grid and a simple loop to mark the borders. The main walking loop follows the path and the enclosed area is calculated using a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach once the starting point is revisited. This solution should be efficient and within the memory constraints of the problem.

The previous solution incorrectly calculated the number of steps and the enclosed area. The steps were counted for the entire path instead of just the steps until the first revisited point, and the BFS algorithm for the area had issues with correctly counting the enclosed area.

Let's correct these issues:

For the steps, we should stop counting as soon as we revisit any point, not just the starting point. We need to keep a set of visited points (including the starting point) and check at each move whether the new position has been visited before. If it has, we stop and that's our step count.

For the area, we need to implement a correct way to calculate the number of enclosed squares. However, this is complicated because the area enclosed may not always be simply connected due to the path potentially doubling back on itself. Since the path does not cross itself and it must end upon returning to a point on the path, we can use a more straightforward method to calculate the area. We will essentially trace the perimeter of the area and then use the visited points to calculate the interior points.

Let's rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('zona.in', 'r') as file:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())
    path = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize the grid with False, indicating that no squares have been visited
grid = [[False] * (N + 2) for _ in range(N + 2)]

# Function to count the area enclosed by the path
def count_area(grid, x, y, N):
    area = 0
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        for j in range(1, N + 1):
            if grid[i][j]:
                area += 1
    return area

# Set the initial position and mark it as visited
x, y = X, Y
visited = set()
visited.add((x, y))
steps = 0
area = 0
found_repeat = False

# Define the direction vectors for NESW
DIRECTIONS = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]  # NESW

# Walk the path
for move in path:
    dx, dy = DIRECTIONS[move - 1]
    x += dx
    y += dy
    if (x, y) in visited:
        if not found_repeat:
            steps = len(visited)
            found_repeat = True
        grid[x][y] = True
    else:
        visited.add((x, y))
        if found_repeat:
            grid[x][y] = True

# Count the area
area = count_area(grid, X, Y, N)

# Write output data to file
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{steps}\n{area}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, we are now correctly counting the number of steps before revisiting any point, and we are correctly calculating the area enclosed by the path after the first point is revisited. We use a `set` to keep track of visited points for the step count and a 2D list `grid` to calculate the area. This should now provide the expected output for the given input.

The previous solution still had issues with the calculation of the number of steps and the area. The number of steps should be the count of unique positions visited before the first revisit, not the length of the visited set when the first revisit is found. The area calculation should consider the number of interior squares enclosed by the path, so the BFS method was not suitable for this use case.

Let's correct the issues:

- The steps need to be counted correctly. When we encounter a revisited point, we stop counting the steps.
- To calculate the area, we can avoid BFS and instead use the idea that the path outlines a shape. We can initialize the area to zero and increment it every time we move South (3) and decrement it every time we move North (1), which effectively counts the number of squares inside the loop created by the path.

I will rewrite the solution with these adjustments:

```python
# Define the direction vectors for NESW
DIRECTIONS = [(0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0)]  # NESW

# Read input data from file
with open('zona.in', 'r') as file:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())
    path = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize variables
x, y = X, Y  # Current position
visited = {(x, y)}  # Set of visited coordinates
area = 0  # Enclosed area
steps_revisited = 0  # Steps before revisiting a point

# Walk the path
for move in path:
    dx, dy = DIRECTIONS[move - 1]
    x, y = x + dx, y + dy
    
    if (x, y) in visited:
        # We found a revisited point
        steps_revisited = L - len(path)
        break
    else:
        # Update the area if moving South or North
        if move == 3:  # South
            area += 1
        elif move == 1:  # North
            area -= 1

        # Add the current position to the visited set
        visited.add((x, y))

    # Reduce the remaining path as we walk
    path = path[1:]

# Write output data to file
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{steps_revisited}\n{area}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly count the number of steps before revisiting the first point and accurately calculate the area enclosed by the path. The area calculation is done by "counting" the number of squares added or removed from the enclosed space as we move South or North. This should provide the expected output for the given input.

The previous solution has a bug in the calculation of steps before revisiting a point. It incorrectly calculates the steps after breaking out of the loop by subtracting the remaining path length from L. Instead, it should count each step individually as the path is traversed.

The logic to calculate the area is also incorrect. While the idea of incrementing when moving South and decrementing when moving North could be part of a working solution, the current implementation does not correctly account for the actual area enclosed by the path. We need to use a different strategy.

To ensure accuracy, we'll take a different approach:

1. Keep track of all the positions visited and stop when a position is revisited for the first time. The number of steps taken until that point is the first answer.
2. For the area, we will simulate filling the enclosed space. After finding the first repeated point, we will continue to walk the rest of the path, marking the grid with a special value (e.g., `True`) to indicate the border of the enclosed area. After the whole path is walked, we will count the number of grid cells enclosed by this border. Since the path does not cross itself, we can use the fill between borders strategy: we start from the leftmost point and scan each row, counting the cells between the first and last cell marked as border in that row, as these will be the enclosed cells.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to simulate filling the enclosed space and counting the filled cells
def fill_and_count(grid, N):
    area = 0
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        start_filling = False
        for j in range(1, N+1):
            if grid[i][j] and not start_filling:
                # Starting edge of the enclosed area
                start_filling = True
            elif grid[i][j] and start_filling:
                # Ending edge of the enclosed area
                area += j - start_col - 1
                start_filling = False
            elif start_filling and not grid[i][j]:
                # Potential enclosed cell, update starting column
                start_col = j
    return area

# Read input data from file
with open('zona.in', 'r') as file:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())
    path = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize the grid with False, indicating that no squares have been visited
grid = [[False] * (N + 2) for _ in range(N + 2)]
# Mark borders as visited to simplify boundary checking
for i in range(N+2):
    grid[i][0] = grid[i][N+1] = grid[0][i] = grid[N+1][i] = True

# Variables for current position, visited positions, and steps
x, y = X, Y
visited_positions = {(x, y)}
steps = 0
revisit_found = False

# Direction vectors for NESW
directions = [(0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0)]

# Walk the path
for p in path:
    dx, dy = directions[p-1]
    x += dx
    y += dy
    steps += 1
    if not revisit_found and (x, y) in visited_positions:
        steps_revisited = steps  # Steps before revisiting
        revisit_found = True  # Stop counting steps after revisiting
    visited_positions.add((x, y))
    grid[x][y] = True  # Mark the path border on the grid

# Calculate the area enclosed by the path
if revisit_found:
    area = fill_and_count(grid, N)
else:
    area = 0  # In case the path doesn't revisit any position

# Write output data to file
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{steps_revisited}\n{area}\n")
```

The above solution should now correctly compute both the number of steps taken before the first revisit and the area enclosed by the path. It uses a fill-and-count strategy to calculate the enclosed area, which is suitable for the nature of the problem as the path does not cross itself.

The error occurs because the variable `start_col` is used before it is assigned a value. This variable is meant to track the starting column of the enclosed area during the filling process, but it is not initialized correctly within the loop.

To fix this, we should initialize `start_col` within the loop when we first encounter the starting edge of the enclosed area, and we should reset it whenever we find the ending edge.

Let's correct the `fill_and_count` function and provide the entire corrected solution with this fix:

```python
# Function to simulate filling the enclosed space and counting the filled cells
def fill_and_count(grid, N):
    area = 0
    for i in range(1, N+1):

                    # Ending edge of the enclosed area, count the filled cells
                    area += j - start_col - 1
                    start_filling = False
    return area

# Initialize the grid with False, indicating that no squares have been visited
grid = [[False] * (N + 2) for _ in range(N + 2)]
# Mark borders as visited to simplify boundary checking
for i in range(N+2):
    grid[i][0] = grid[i][N+1] = grid[0][i] = grid[N+1][i] = True

# Variables for current position, visited positions, and steps
x, y = X, Y
visited_positions = {(x, y)}
steps_revisited = 0

# Direction vectors for NESW
directions = [(0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0)]

# Walk the path
for p in path:
    dx, dy = directions[p-1]
    x += dx
    y += dy
    if (x, y) in visited_positions:
        # First revisited point found, stop counting steps
        break
    visited_positions.add((x, y))

# Count the steps before the first revisit
steps_revisited = len(visited_positions)

# Mark the path on the grid and calculate the area enclosed by the path
for p in path:
    dx, dy = directions[p-1]
    x += dx
    y += dy
    grid[x][y] = True
    if (x, y) == (X, Y):
        # Path has returned to the start, stop marking the grid

area = fill_and_count(grid, N)

# Write output data to file
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{steps_revisited}\n{area}\n")
```

The above solution should now work correctly. It counts the number of steps before the first revisit by breaking out of the loop immediately when the first revisited point is found, and it accurately counts the area enclosed by the path. The `fill_and_count` function has been fixed to properly initialize `start_col` and count the enclosed area.

The problem with the previous solution is that it does not correctly account for the revisited point when calculating the number of steps and it incorrectly assumes that the path will always touch the start point again, which is not necessarily true. Additionally, the `fill_and_count` function had some logical flaws in its implementation and did not correctly calculate the enclosed area.

To fix the issues, we'll need to make the following changes:

1. Correctly count the steps before the first revisit. This involves breaking out of the loop immediately when the revisited point is found, not after completing the entire path.

2. To calculate the area, we need to ensure we're including all points within the path boundary. We can implement a flood-fill algorithm (similar to how the "paint bucket" tool works in graphics programs) that starts from a point known to be outside the path and counts every space it can reach that isn't part of the path boundary. Every space visited by the flood-fill algorithm but not part of the path boundary counts towards the enclosed area.

Here's the updated solution:

```python
# Function to perform the flood-fill algorithm
def flood_fill(grid, x, y, N):
    if grid[x][y]:
        return 0
    area = 1
    grid[x][y] = True  # Mark as visited
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    for dx, dy in directions:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
            area += flood_fill(grid, nx, ny, N)
    return area

# Read input data from file
with open('zona.in', 'r') as file:
    X, Y, N, L = map(int, file.readline().split())
    path = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Convert (X, Y) from 1-indexed to 0-indexed
X, Y = X - 1, Y - 1

# Initialize the grid with False, indicating that no squares are part of the path boundary
grid = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]

# Variables for current position and visited positions
x, y = X, Y
visited_positions = {(x, y)}

# Direction vectors for NESW
directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

# Walk the path
for index, p in enumerate(path):
    dx, dy = directions[p-1]
    x += dx
    y += dy
    if (x, y) in visited_positions:
        # First revisited point found, record the steps taken
        steps_revisited = index + 1
        break
    visited_positions.add((x, y))
    grid[x][y] = True  # Mark the path boundary

# Use flood-fill from the top-left corner (0,0) to calculate the enclosed area
area = flood_fill(grid, 0, 0, N) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the starting outside point

# Write output data to file
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{steps_revisited}\n{area}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the number of steps before the first revisit and the area enclosed by the path. It uses a flood-fill algorithm starting from outside the path to count the enclosed area, only filling in spaces that aren't part of the path boundary.
