Ionuţ pleacă în drumeţie într-o porţiune de teren de formă pătratică cu latura de $N$ metri. O hartă a zonei are trasat un caroiaj care împarte zona în $N \cdot N$ pătrate unitate, cu latura de $1$ metru. Astfel harta zonei are aspectul unui tablou pătratic cu $N$ linii şi $N$ coloane. Liniile şi coloanele sunt numerotate de la $1$ la $N$. Elementele tabloului bidimensional corespund pătratelor unitate. Zona poate fi parcursă străbătând oricare dintre laturile pătratelor unitate **cel mult o singură dată**.

~[55bdc2f5c84ca3f4b5a80867350d0328.png]

Ionuţ pleacă din punctul aflat în colţul din dreapta jos al pătratului unitate din linia $X$, coloana $Y$ şi se deplasează făcând **un pas** (parcurgând o latură a unui pătrat unitate) în una din direcţiile $Nord$, $Est$, $Sud$, $Vest$. Pentru a reţine mai uşor traseul foloseşte următoarea codificare pentru cele $4$ direcţii: $1$ pentru deplasarea spre $Nord$, $2$ pentru deplasarea spre $Est$, $3$ pentru deplasarea spre $Sud$, respectiv $4$ pentru deplasarea spre $Vest$. Ajuns într-alt punct (colţ de pătrat unitate), Ionuţ continuă să se deplaseze fără a trece de mai multe ori pe aceeaşi latură a unui pătrat unitate. 

Ionuţ se opreşte în momentul în care ajunge într-un punct prin care a mai trecut. Traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct delimitează o zonă de teren formată din pătrate unitate.

# Cerinţă

Dându-se linia $X$ şi coloana $Y$ corespunzătoare poziţiei de plecare a lui Ionuţ, dimensiunea zonei $N$, lungimea traseului $L$ şi traseul determinaţi:

$a)$ Numărul de paşi parcurşi între prima şi a doua trecere prin punctul de oprire.
$b)$ Numărul de pătrate unitate interioare zonei delimitată de traseul străbătut între cele două treceri prin acelaşi punct.  


# Date de intrare


Pe prima linie a fişierului `zona.in` se află valorile $X$, $Y$, $N$ şi $L$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând coordonatele punctului de plecare, dimensiunea terenului şi lungimea traseului parcurs. Pe următoarea linie se află $L$ valori din mulţimea $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ despărţite prin câte un spaţiu, reprezentând codificarea întregului traseu.


# Date de ieșire


Fişierul `zona.out` va conţine **două** linii, pe prima linie un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $a)$, iar pe linia a doua, un număr natural reprezentând răspunsul la cerinţa $b)$. **Pentru a putea primi punctaje parțiale, fiecare linie trebuie să conțină un număr!**

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < N < 51$
* $0 < X, Y < N$
* $0 < L < 2501$
* Se garantează faptul că traseul trece de două ori prin acelaşi punct şi nu parcurge de două ori aceeaşi latură.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $a)$ se acordă $20\%$ din punctaj.
* Pentru determinarea corectă a numărului de la punctul $b)$ se acordă $80\%$ din punctaj.

The found output is incorrect because the previous implementation had two main issues:

1. It marked the first step as visited twice due to the immediate initialization of the `visited` set with the starting point and failed to record the second visit correctly. This caused the steps between visits to be off by one.
2. The flood fill function was incorrectly implemented. It didn't check for the visited edges appropriately and didn't fill in the internal area as intended.

To fix these issues, I will make sure to:

1. Initialize the `visited` set without the starting point; it will get added naturally in the loop.
2. Correctly implement the flood fill function to identify the internal area enclosed by the path.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Define the movement direction vectors
directions = {
    1: (-1, 0),  # North
    2: (0, 1),   # East
    3: (1, 0),   # South

}

    if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and matrix[x][y] == 0:
        matrix[x][y] = fill_value

            flood_fill(matrix, x + dx, y + dy, fill_value, n)

# Initialize the board
board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

# Adjust start coordinates for 0-based indexing
x -= 1
y -= 1

visited = set()  # Starts empty; the first step will add the starting point
steps_between_visits = 0
first_visit = None

# Start walking the path
for i, move in enumerate(path):
    if first_visit is not None:
        steps_between_visits += 1

    dx, dy = directions[move]
    x, y = x + dx, y + dy

    # Check for the first or second visit
    if (x, y) in visited:
        if first_visit is None:
            first_visit = (x, y)  # Record the first visit
            steps_between_visits = 0  # Reset the step counter after first visit
        else:
            # Stop when the same point is reached again
            break
    else:
        visited.add((x, y))  # Mark new position as visited

# Perform flood fill from the position of the first visit to find the internal area

The found output is incorrect because the flood fill function was not implemented properly to handle the enclosed area detection. Additionally, the way the first and second visits are handled needs to be fixed. Moreover, the flood fill should be performed from an outside point to properly fill the external area, and the internal area can then be calculated by subtracting the external from the total.

Let's correct these issues:

1. We will initiate flood fill from an external point (such as `(0, 0)` which we know is outside) to fill all the regions that are outside the path.
2. We will then subtract the count of filled squares from the total number of squares to get the internal area.
3. Correct the step counting logic to ensure we start counting steps after the first visit to a point.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Define the movement direction vectors
directions = {
    1: (-1, 0),  # North
    2: (0, 1),   # East
    3: (1, 0),   # South
    4: (0, -1)   # West
}

def flood_fill(matrix, x, y, n):

        matrix[x][y] = -1

# Initialize the board and visited points
board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

# Adjust start coordinates for 0-based indexing
x, y = x - 1, y - 1

visited = set()
steps_between_visits = -1  # Initialize to -1 to account for the first step increment

# Start walking the path
for i, move in enumerate(path):
    dx, dy = directions[move]
    x, y = x + dx, y + dy

    # Check if the position is already visited
    if (x, y) in visited:
        steps_between_visits = i  # Record the number of steps taken
        break
    else:
        visited.add((x, y))

# Perform flood fill from an outside point to mark the external area
flood_fill(board, 0, 0, n)

# Count the total number of squares minus the filled external squares to get the internal area
area = sum(row.count(0) for row in board)

The found output is incorrect because the program does not properly handle the steps counting and the internal area calculation. The issues are:

1. The steps between visits should be counted starting from the step after the first visit to the repeated point, but the code is counting from the beginning, including the first step twice.
2. The internal area calculation is incorrect. The previous code attempted to use a flood fill from the outside to mark the external area, but this approach doesn't consider the walls created by walking the path. The correct approach is to use the path to construct the walls and then count the internal squares that are enclosed.

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the solution. I will use an adjacency matrix to represent the walls and then count the internal squares that are not part of the walls or visited during the walk. Since we know the path doesn't cross itself except at the starting/ending point, we can just count the internal squares after completing the walk until the repeated point is reached.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read the data from 'zona.in'

# Adjust start coordinates for 0-based indexing
x, y = start_x - 1, start_y - 1

# Variables to keep track of the first and second visit
first_visit = None
second_visit = None
visited = set([(x, y)])
wall = set()

# Process the path

    dx, dy = directions[move]
    new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy

    # Check if the new position is the start position
    if (new_x, new_y) in visited:
        second_visit = i + 1
        break
    else:
        visited.add((new_x, new_y))
        wall.add((min(x, new_x), min(y, new_y), max(x, new_x), max(y, new_y)))

It seems there is still a problem with the steps counting and the internal area calculation. The step count should only be incremented after encountering the same point for the first time, and the internal area needs to be calculated correctly by ensuring that no squares are counted more than once.

Here is the revised approach, with a corrected step counting and internal area calculation:

1. We will use `visited` to keep track of all the points visited and the step count when they were first visited.
2. When we revisit a point, we can then calculate the number of steps between visits.
3. To calculate the internal area, we will use the `visited` information to mark the path and then count the number of internal squares that aren't part of the path.

Let's implement the revised solution:

```python
# Read the data from 'zona.in'
with open('zona.in', 'r') as file:
    x, y, n, l = map(int, file.readline().split())
    moves = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Adjust start coordinates for 0-based indexing
x, y = x - 1, y - 1

# Variables to keep track of the visited points and first revisit
visited = {(x, y): 0}
first_revisit_idx = None

# Translate moves into coordinate changes
move_offsets = {
    1: (-1, 0),  # North
    2: (0, 1),   # East
    3: (1, 0),   # South
    4: (0, -1),  # West
}

# Walk through the path and record visited points
for i, move in enumerate(moves):
    dx, dy = move_offsets[move]
    x += dx
    y += dy
    if (x, y) in visited and first_revisit_idx is None:
        first_revisit_idx = i
        break  # Stop at the first revisit
    visited[(x, y)] = i + 1  # Record the step index of visiting each point

# Calculate steps between first visit and revisit
steps_between_visits = first_revisit_idx - list(visited.values())[0] + 1

# Initialize the board and mark the visited path
board = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
for (vx, vy), idx in visited.items():
    board[vx][vy] = 1 if idx <= first_revisit_idx else 0

# Count the internal squares
internal_squares = sum(row.count(0) for row in board) - len(visited) + 1 # Subtract the path itself

# Write the results to 'zona.out'
with open('zona.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{steps_between_visits}\n{internal_squares}\n")
```
