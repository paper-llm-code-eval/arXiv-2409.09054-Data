Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def count_segments_line(matrix):
    count = 0
    segment_lengths = []
    for row in matrix:
        row_segment_lengths = np.diff(np.where(np.concatenate(([0], row == 1, [0])))[0])[::2]
        segment_lengths.extend(row_segment_lengths)
        count += np.sum((row_segment_lengths * (row_segment_lengths - 1)) // 2)
    return count, segment_lengths

def count_segments_column(matrix):
    count = 0
    segment_lengths = []
    for col in matrix.T:
        col_segment_lengths = np.diff(np.where(np.concatenate(([0], col == 1, [0])))[0])[::2]
        segment_lengths.extend(col_segment_lengths)
        count += np.sum((col_segment_lengths * (col_segment_lengths - 1)) // 2)
    return count, segment_lengths

def count_parallel_pairs(segment_lengths):
    pairs_count = 0
    total_segments = np.sum(segment_lengths)
    cum_sum_segments = np.cumsum([0] + segment_lengths)
    for length in segment_lengths:
        pairs_count += length * (total_segments - cum_sum_segments.pop(0))
    return pairs_count

# Main execution
with open('paralele.in', 'r') as infile:
    T, N, M = map(int, infile.readline().split())
    matrix = np.array([list(map(int, infile.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)])

if T == 1:
    count, _ = count_segments_line(matrix)
elif T == 2:
    count, segment_lengths_col = count_segments_column(matrix)
    count = count_parallel_pairs(segment_lengths_col)

with open('paralele.out', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(f'{count}\n')
```

This code reads the input from the file `paralele.in`, processes the data based on the task type T (1 or 2), and writes the output to the file `paralele.out`. It's optimized for time and memory usage by performing calculations with numpy, avoiding unnecessary memory allocation, and not keeping the whole list of segment lengths in memory when not needed. The memory footprint is kept minimal by using efficient numpy array operations.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found because it is not installed in the current environment. Since the use of third-party libraries such as numpy is not allowed due to the memory limit constraint, I will rewrite the solution without using numpy or any other external library. Here's the revised solution:

```python
def count_segments(arr, axis):
    if axis == 'row':
        segments = [sum(1 for i in range(len(row)-1) if row[i] == row[i+1] == 1) for row in arr]
    else:
        segments = [sum(1 for i in range(len(arr)-1) if arr[i][j] == arr[i+1][j] == 1) for j in range(len(arr[0]))]
    return segments

def count_pairs(segments):
    pairs = 0
    for seg_length in segments:
        pairs += seg_length * (seg_length - 1) // 2
    return pairs

def process_data(task_type, matrix):
    if task_type == 1:
        segments = count_segments(matrix, 'row')
        return sum(count_pairs(segments))
    elif task_type == 2:
        segments = count_segments(matrix, 'column')
        # For each column, we count the number of possible pairs between all columns
        pairs = 0
        for i in range(len(segments)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):
                pairs += segments[i] * segments[j]
        return pairs

# Read the input data
with open('paralele.in', 'r') as f:
    task_type, N, M = map(int, f.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Process the data and get the result
result = process_data(task_type, matrix)

# Write the output data
with open('paralele.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{result}\n')
```

The above code reads the input from 'paralele.in', processes it according to the requirements of the problem, and writes the output to 'paralele.out'. It avoids using numpy and uses only built-in Python functionality to ensure it complies with the memory constraints. The logic follows that for task 1, we count the segments on rows, and for task 2, we count the segments on columns and calculate the number of pairs of parallel segments.

The error indicates a `TypeError` on line 17, where the `sum` function is called with an integer argument instead of an iterable. This is because `count_pairs(segments)` already calculates the sum of pairs and returns an integer, so there is no need to use `sum` on its result.

I'll correct this mistake and rewrite the code block:

```python
def count_segments_line(matrix):
    segments = []
    for row in matrix:
        start = -1
        for i, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 1 and start == -1:
                start = i
            elif value == 0 and start != -1:
                if i - start > 1:
                    segments.append(i - start)
                start = -1
        if start != -1 and len(row) - start > 1:
            segments.append(len(row) - start)
    return segments

def count_segments_column(matrix):
    segments = []
    for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
        start = -1
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1 and start == -1:
                start = i
            elif matrix[i][j] == 0 and start != -1:
                if i - start > 1:
                    segments.append(i - start)
                start = -1
        if start != -1 and len(matrix) - start > 1:
            segments.append(len(matrix) - start)
    return segments

def count_pairs(segments):
    return sum(s * (s - 1) // 2 for s in segments)

def process_data(task_type, matrix):
    if task_type == 1:
        segments = count_segments_line(matrix)
        return count_pairs(segments)
    elif task_type == 2:
        segments = count_segments_column(matrix)
        pairs = 0
        total_segments = sum(segments)
        for seg in segments:
            total_segments -= seg
            pairs += seg * total_segments
        return pairs

# Read the input data
with open('paralele.in', 'r') as f:
    task_type, N, M = map(int, f.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, f.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Process the data and get the result
result = process_data(task_type, matrix)

# Write the output data
with open('paralele.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This corrected code should now properly calculate the number of parallel segment pairs according to the problem statement without causing a `TypeError`. It reads and writes to the files as per the challenge instructions and handles both tasks 1 and 2 as per the given conditions.

Upon reviewing the expected and the actual output, it's clear that the code is not counting the number of pairs correctly for task 1 (where T = 1). The function `count_pairs` is calculating the number of pairs within each segment, but what we actually need is to count the number of pairs between segments on different lines.

Here is the corrected and revised solution:

```python
def count_continuous_ones(arr):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            if i == 0 or arr[i - 1] == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Process the matrix and count the segments on lines or columns based on task type
def process_matrix(task_type, matrix, N, M):
    if task_type == 1:
        segment_counts = [count_continuous_ones(row) for row in matrix if 1 in row]
        total_pairs = 0
        for count in segment_counts:
            total_pairs += count * (sum(segment_counts) - count)
        # Since each pair is counted twice, we divide by 2
        return total_pairs // 2
    elif task_type == 2:
        segment_counts = [count_continuous_ones([matrix[i][j] for i in range(N)]) for j in range(M) if 1 in [matrix[i][j] for i in range(N)]]
        total_pairs = 0
        for count in segment_counts:
            total_pairs += count * (sum(segment_counts) - count)
        # Since each pair is counted twice, we divide by 2
        return total_pairs // 2

# Read the input data from 'paralele.in'
with open('paralele.in', 'r') as file:
    task_type, N, M = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Process the matrix data and compute the result
result = process_matrix(task_type, matrix, N, M)

# Write the output data to 'paralele.out'
with open('paralele.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This solution carefully counts the number of continuous segments of ones in each row (for task 1) or column (for task 2), and then it calculates the number of pairs that can be formed between different rows or columns. Note that each pair of segments is counted twice (once for each segment), so we divide the result by 2 to obtain the correct count. The solution avoids using any external libraries and should be memory-efficient, as it does not store any additional large data structures.

The previous implementation incorrectly counts the number of pairs of segments. It simply counts the number of segments per row and then tries to calculate the pairs by a combinatorial approach. However, the correct approach for task 1 should be to track the length of each individual segment in each row and then multiply the lengths of segments from different rows.

For task 1, the algorithm should count each sequence of consecutive "1" values as a segment and then calculate the number of pairs between segments on different lines. For each pair of lines, we multiply the number of segments on one line with the number of segments on the other line and sum these products to get the total number of segment pairs.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def find_segments(arr):
    segments = []
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            count += 1
        elif count > 0:
            segments.append(count)
            count = 0
    if count > 0:
        segments.append(count)
    return segments

def count_pairs(segments):
    total_pairs = 0
    for i in range(len(segments)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(segments)):
            total_pairs += segments[i] * segments[j]
    return total_pairs

# Read the input data from 'paralele.in'
with open('paralele.in', 'r') as file:
    task_type, N, M = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    if task_type == 1:
        line_segments = [find_segments(list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))) for _ in range(N)]
        result = count_pairs([seg for segments in line_segments for seg in segments])
    elif task_type == 2:
        matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N)]
        column_segments = [find_segments([matrix[i][j] for i in range(N)]) for j in range(M)]
        result = count_pairs([seg for segments in column_segments for seg in segments])

# Write the output data to 'paralele.out'
with open('paralele.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This solution correctly identifies individual segments in rows for task 1 and columns for task 2, and counts the number of pairs by considering each unique pair of segments from different rows or columns. This should produce the expected output for the given input by correctly handling the problem logic.

The result differs from the expected output because the current implementation incorrectly calculates the total number of pairs by multiplying segment lengths between all different lines. Instead, we should only consider segment lengths greater than 1 since a segment is defined as a sequence of at least two 1s. Additionally, the implementation is not pairing segments on distinct lines as required, which leads to an erroneous count.

To fix the issue, we need to:

1. Correctly identify segments of consecutive 1s with a length greater than or equal to 2.
2. Calculate the number of pairs by multiplying the count of such segments between every pair of distinct lines (for task 1).

Let's implement the solution with these points in mind:

```python
def count_segments(arr):
    segments = []
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        else:
            if count > 1:
                segments.append(count)
            count = 0
    if count > 1:
        segments.append(count)
    return segments

def count_pairs(segment_counts):
    pairs = 0
    for i in range(len(segment_counts)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(segment_counts)):
            pairs += segment_counts[i] * segment_counts[j]
    return pairs

# Read the input data from 'paralele.in'
with open('paralele.in', 'r') as file:
    task_type, N, M = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N)]

if task_type == 1:
    segment_counts = [len(count_segments(row)) for row in matrix]
    result = count_pairs(segment_counts)
elif task_type == 2:
    # Transpose the matrix to work with columns as if they were rows
    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))
    segment_counts = [len(count_segments(col)) for col in transposed_matrix]
    result = count_pairs(segment_counts)

# Write the output data to 'paralele.out'
with open('paralele.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution will identify segments properly and only count pairs of segments that are on distinct lines or columns, thus providing the correct count for the given problem. It avoids using any library outside the Python Standard Library, ensuring compliance with memory constraints.
