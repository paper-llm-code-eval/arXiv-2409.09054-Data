    # Since we can only swap consecutive rows or columns, it's not possible to sort the matrix entirely.
    # Therefore, if the matrix is not a yin-yang matrix initially, there is no number of operations that can make it one.

The error you are encountering is because the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the challenge requires optimizing for both time and memory and suggests using highly efficient libraries like `numpy`, and there is a constraint on the size of the memory footprint, I'll avoid using `numpy` and focus on achieving optimization with standard Python operations.

Given the problem constraints, if the matrix cannot be transformed into a yin-yang matrix by swapping rows or columns alone, we return `-1`. We can check if rows and columns are already sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, we can conclude that it's impossible to achieve a yin-yang matrix with the given operations.

Here is the revised solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Function to check if all rows and columns are non-decreasing
def is_yin_yang(rows, cols, matrix):
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(1, cols):
            if matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j-1]:
                return False
    for j in range(cols):
        for i in range(1, rows):
            if matrix[i][j] < matrix[i-1][j]:
                return False
    return True

# Read the data from the input file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, M = map(int, file_in.readline().split()) # Read the dimensions
    matrix = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Check if the matrix is yin-yang, otherwise, it's not possible to sort with the given operations
result = 0 if is_yin_yang(N, M, matrix) else -1

# Write the result to the output file
with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(result))
```

This code should now run without any external dependencies and within the memory limit, while still efficiently solving the given problem. The code reads from "yinyang.in" and writes the result to "yinyang.out".

Upon reevaluation, the result differences indicate that my initial approach was incorrect. My solution prematurely concluded that if the matrix is not already yin-yang, it is impossible to make it yin-yang with any number of swaps, which is not true according to the problem statement.

The problem allows for swapping adjacent rows or columns to achieve a yin-yang matrix, and the goal is to determine the minimum number of such swaps required. However, the problem is non-trivial and requires a more complex algorithm to solve.

One way to approach this problem is to individually sort rows and columns, counting the minimum number of swaps needed to sort each of them using bubble sort, which translates directly to the row and column swaps described in the problem. If at least one row or one column cannot be sorted by adjacent swaps, we return `-1`.

Let's rewrite the solution with a correct algorithm that counts the swaps needed for sorting rows and columns:

```python
# Function to count minimum adjacent swaps needed to sort a list
def count_swaps(lst):
    swaps = 0
    n = len(lst)
    swapped = True
    while swapped:
        swapped = False
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lst[i - 1] > lst[i]:
                lst[i - 1], lst[i] = lst[i], lst[i - 1]  # Swap
                swaps += 1
                swapped = True
    return swaps

# Read the data from the input file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, M = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Try to sort rows and columns and count the swaps
total_swaps = 0
for i in range(N):
    total_swaps += count_swaps(matrix[i])

# Transpose the matrix to work with columns like rows
matrix_T = list(zip(*matrix))
for j in range(M):
    total_swaps += count_swaps(list(matrix_T[j]))

# If the total_swaps is greater than zero after trying to sort, then it's possible
# to sort the matrix. Otherwise, it's impossible.
result = total_swaps if total_swaps > 0 else -1

# Write the result to the output file
with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(result))
```

This solution should provide the correct minimum number of swaps or `-1` if it's impossible to sort the matrix into a yin-yang matrix by swapping only adjacent rows or columns. The code reads from "yinyang.in" and writes the result to "yinyang.out".

The result differs because the previous algorithm I provided incorrectly assumes that if the matrix is not initially sorted, it cannot be transformed into a yin-yang matrix, which is not always the case. The mistake was to check if the total number of swaps is greater than zero, which is not a valid condition to conclude if the matrix is sortable or not.

In addition, the problem statement indicates that all elements in the matrix A are distinct, which means that a unique sorting order exists for rows and columns. The given matrix is always transformable into a yin-yang matrix through a series of swaps, and it's only a matter of finding the minimum number of swaps required to do so.

To correct the solution, it is necessary to calculate the inversion count for each row and column. An inversion is when A[i] > A[j] for i < j. Since we are only allowed to swap adjacent elements, the inversion count will give us the minimum number of swaps required to sort each row and each column. The sum of these inversion counts across all rows and columns will be the minimum number of swaps required to make the entire matrix yin-yang.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
def count_inversions(arr):
    inversions = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                inversions += 1
    return inversions

# Read the data from the input file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, M = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate the total inversion count for all rows and columns
total_swaps = sum(count_inversions(row) for row in matrix)
matrix_T = list(zip(*matrix))  # Transpose the matrix to iterate over columns
total_swaps += sum(count_inversions(col) for col in matrix_T)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(total_swaps))
```

This code uses the corrected logic to calculate the total number of swaps needed to sort each row and column of the matrix and sum them to find the minimum number of swaps required to convert the matrix into a yin-yang matrix. It then writes the result to "yinyang.out".

The issue with the current approach is that it does not take into account that sorting rows and columns independently could lead to a scenario where the matrix is still not yin-yang, despite all rows and columns being individually sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because sorting rows and columns must happen in a way that is consistent across the entire matrix.

To address this, we need to adjust our algorithm to consider the relationship between rows and columns when performing swaps. One key insight into the problem is that if we sort all rows in ascending order first, then we should only need to perform swaps on columns to achieve the yin-yang configuration. This is because any out-of-order elements in columns can be fixed by swaps without disturbing the sorted order of rows, provided that the original matrix had distinct elements.

Here is the correct solution, which first sorts rows and then only counts inversions in columns:

```python
# Function to count the number of swaps needed to sort each row using bubble sort
def count_row_swaps(matrix):
    row_swaps = 0
    for row in matrix:
        for i in range(len(row)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(row)):
                if row[i] > row[j]:
                    row[i], row[j] = row[j], row[i]
                    row_swaps += 1
    return row_swaps

# Function to count inversions in each column
def count_col_inversions(matrix):
    col_swaps = 0
    for col in range(len(matrix[0])):
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(matrix)):
                if matrix[i][col] > matrix[j][col]:
                    col_swaps += 1
    return col_swaps

# Read the data from the input file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, M = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# First, count the swaps needed to sort each row
row_swaps = count_row_swaps(matrix)

# Then count the inversions needed to sort columns after rows are sorted
col_swaps = count_col_inversions(matrix)

# The total number of swaps needed is the sum of row_swaps and col_swaps
total_swaps = row_swaps + col_swaps

# Write the result to the output file
with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(total_swaps))
```

This solution first sorts all the rows and then counts the number of inversions in each column, which corresponds to the number of swaps needed. The total number of swaps is the sum of swaps needed for sorting rows and fixing columns. This should provide the correct minimum number of swaps needed to transform the given matrix into a yin-yang matrix. The result is written to "yinyang.out".

I apologize for the confusion. The result differs because my previous solutions were not accurately modeling the problem's requirements. Instead of independently sorting rows and columns, we need to consider that a single swap operation may affect both a row and a column simultaneously. The problem requires a more complex approach where we need to determine the correct order of rows and columns first and then calculate the number of swaps to arrange them into that order.

To achieve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the correct order of the rows and columns based on the smallest elements in each row and the leftmost elements in each column.
2. Calculate the number of swaps required to bring the rows and columns into this order. As elements are distinct, we can use their final positions as unique identifiers.

Let's rewrite the solution with the correct approach:

```python
# Function to count the number of swaps needed to order the elements based on their final positions
def count_swaps(final_positions):
    seen = set()
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(len(final_positions)):
        while i not in seen and final_positions[i] != i:
            swaps += 1
            seen.add(i)
            i = final_positions[i]
        seen.add(i)
    return swaps

# Read the data from the input file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, M = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Determine the final positions for rows based on the smallest element in each row
final_row_positions = [min(enumerate(row), key=lambda x: x[1])[0] for row in matrix]
row_swaps = count_swaps(final_row_positions)

# Transpose the matrix to work with columns
transpose_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))
# Determine the final positions for columns based on the first element in each column
final_col_positions = [min(enumerate(col), key=lambda x: x[1])[0] for col in transpose_matrix]
col_swaps = count_swaps(final_col_positions)

# The total number of swaps needed is the sum of row_swaps and col_swaps
total_swaps = row_swaps + col_swaps

# Write the result to the output file
with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(total_swaps))
```

In this solution, we identify the final positions of rows and columns by looking at the smallest elements (for rows) and the first elements (for columns), and then we perform a count of swaps required to get them into these final positions. This approach should accurately reflect the number of swap operations needed to achieve a yin-yang matrix. The result is then written to "yinyang.out".

The result differs because the current approach is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of swaps needed to organize the matrix into a yin-yang matrix. The central issue is that the previous solution does not accurately account for the constraints imposed by the problem, specifically the relationship between sorting rows and columns while maintaining the non-decreasing order property for both.

In the case of the latest input where the matrix is already in yin-yang order, the solution incorrectly calculates swaps, indicating that the logic for determining the final positions and counting swaps is flawed.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to apply a graph-based approach. If we consider each row and column as a node in a graph, the desired final order of these nodes can be obtained by sorting their smallest elements. Swapping rows or columns is essentially the same as finding the minimum number of swaps to order a permutation, which can be represented as cycles in the graph. The number of swaps needed to arrange a cycle of length `k` is `k-1`.

Here's a new approach to the solution:

```python
def find_cycles(permutation):
    visited = [False] * len(permutation)
    cycles = []
    for i in range(len(permutation)):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            current = i
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                cycle.append(current)
                current = permutation[current]
            cycles.append(cycle)
    return cycles

def min_swaps_for_cycles(cycles):
    return sum(len(cycle) - 1 for cycle in cycles if len(cycle) > 1)

# Read the data from the input file
with open('yinyang.in', 'r') as file_in:
    N, M = map(int, file_in.readline().split())
    matrix = [list(map(int, file_in.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Find the correct order (permutation) for rows and columns
row_order = sorted(range(N), key=lambda x: matrix[x][0])
col_order = sorted(range(M), key=lambda x: matrix[0][x])

# Find the cycles in the permutations
row_cycles = find_cycles(row_order)
col_cycles = find_cycles(col_order)

# Calculate the minimum number of swaps needed
min_swaps = min_swaps_for_cycles(row_cycles) + min_swaps_for_cycles(col_cycles)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('yinyang.out', 'w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(str(min_swaps))
```

This solution should correctly identify the cycles in the permutation representing the final sorted order for rows and columns. It then calculates the minimum number of swaps needed based on these cycles. The result is written to "yinyang.out".
