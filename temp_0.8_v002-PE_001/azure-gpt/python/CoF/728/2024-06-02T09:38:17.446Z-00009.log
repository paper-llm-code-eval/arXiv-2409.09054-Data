Vânătorul șef al regelui Arthur a primit însărcinare să vâneze primele rațe ce se întorc din țările calde. Regele fiind un tip cu idei fixe, i-a cerut vânătorului să vâneze rațele albe cu săgeți albe, iar rațele negre cu săgeți negre.

Rațele vin în rânduri (stoluri) din ce în ce mai mari: mai întâi una, apoi două, trei, cinci, opt, treisprezece, ș.a.m.d. Se observă că numărul de rațe dintr-un rând este egal cu numărul de rațe de pe cele două rânduri anterioare. Rațele fiind niște creaturi ordonate zboară în rânduri, în care nu vei putea găsi două rațe de aceeași culoare alăturate, fiecare rând începând cu o rață albă.

Vânătorul știe că dacă a început să doboare o rață, trebuie să le doboare pe toate de pe rândul acesteia, deoarece supraviețuitoarele vor alerta celelalte rațe și ele nu se vor mai întoarce niciodată, iar vânătorul nostru își va pierde slujba.

# Cerință

Știind că vânătorul a primit $ka$ săgeți albe și $kb$ săgeți negre, trebuie să determinați câte rânduri de rațe a doborât și câte săgeți de fiecare tip i-au rămas, știind că el vrea să-și păstreze slujba.

# Date de intrare

De pe primele două linii ale fișierului de intrare `vanatoare.in` se citesc numerele ka și kb (în această ordine).

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `vanatoare.out` va conține:

* pe prima linie numărul de rânduri doborâte
* pe linia a doua numărul de săgeți albe rămase
* pe linia a treia numărul de săgeți negre rămase

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq ka, kb \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$;

    file.write(str(ka_rem) + '\n')
    file.write(str(kb_rem) + '\n')
```

This Python code should solve the given problem efficiently with respect to both time and memory constraints. It reads arrow counts from `vanatoare.in`, calculates the number of hunted rows, and writes the results to `vanatoare.out`. The code does not use `input()` or `print()` and adheres to the memory limit by using numpy for array operations.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` library is not available. However, since the use of `numpy` is not actually necessary for this problem, we can solve it using pure Python without any additional libraries. Let's rewrite the solution without `numpy`.

Below is an updated code block that will work in an environment without `numpy` installed:

```python
# Function to generate the Fibonacci sequence until the requested number of arrows is exceeded
def generate_fib_sequence(max_arrows):
    fib_sequence = [1, 1]
    total_arrows_used = 2
    while True:
        next_fib_number = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
        if total_arrows_used + next_fib_number > max_arrows:
            break
        else:
            fib_sequence.append(next_fib_number)
            total_arrows_used += next_fib_number
    return fib_sequence

# Function to calculate the remaining arrows and the number of rows hunted
def calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb):
    white_fibs = generate_fib_sequence(ka)
    black_fibs = generate_fib_sequence(kb)
    
    # Calculate how many rows can be hunted based on both white and black arrows
    rows_hunted = min(len(white_fibs), len(black_fibs))

    # Calculate the remaining arrows
    white_arrows_used = sum(white_fibs[:rows_hunted])
    black_arrows_used = sum(black_fibs[:rows_hunted] if rows_hunted % 2 == 0 else black_fibs[:rows_hunted - 1])

    # Update the remaining arrows
    ka -= white_arrows_used
    kb -= black_arrows_used

    return rows_hunted, ka, kb

# Read the arrow count from file
with open('vanatoare.in', 'r') as file:
    ka = int(file.readline().strip())
    kb = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the ducks hunted and the remaining arrows
rows_hunted, ka_rem, kb_rem = calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb)

# Write the results to file
with open('vanatoare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(rows_hunted) + '\n')
    file.write(str(ka_rem) + '\n')
    file.write(str(kb_rem) + '\n')
```

This solution complies with the memory limit, does not use `numpy`, and writes the output to the specified file without using `input()` or `print()`. It also adheres to the challenge constraints and should be an efficient implementation that avoids unnecessary memory usage.

After evaluating the discrepancy between the expected and found output, I've identified that the issue is with calculating the black arrows used. The previous implementation incorrectly assumed that the number of black ducks in a row would always be one less than the number of white ducks. However, because each row alternates colors and starts with a white duck, the number of black ducks will be equal to the number of white ducks if the row has an even number of ducks, and one less if the row has an odd number of ducks.

Let's correct the function for calculating the black arrows used. We need to account for the fact that the last row hunted could have the same number of black and white ducks if its size is even, or one less black duck if its size is odd.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the remaining arrows and the number of rows hunted
def calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb):
    rows_hunted = 0
    last_white = 1
    last_black = 0
    current_row = 1

    # While we have enough arrows to hunt the current row
    while ka >= last_white and kb >= last_black:
        # Update the arrow count
        ka -= last_white
        kb -= last_black

        # Update the last two duck counts and the current row size
        last_white, last_black = last_black + 1, last_white
        current_row = last_white + last_black

        # Increment the number of rows hunted
        rows_hunted += 1

        # If the current row size is even, next row will have the same number of black ducks
        # Otherwise, it will have one less
        if current_row % 2 == 0:
            last_black += 1

    return rows_hunted, ka, kb

# Read the arrow count from file
with open('vanatoare.in', 'r') as file:
    ka = int(file.readline().strip())
    kb = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the ducks hunted and the remaining arrows
rows_hunted, ka_rem, kb_rem = calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb)

# Write the results to file
with open('vanatoare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{rows_hunted}\n")
    file.write(f"{ka_rem}\n")
    file.write(f"{kb_rem}\n")
```

This solution should produce the correct output. It takes into account the alternating colors and the pattern of the ducks in the rows. The adjustment to the calculation of the black arrows used should now align with the expected output.

The discrepancy between the expected and the found output indicates that there is a bug in the calculation of arrows remaining after hunting each row of ducks. The issue seems to be in the way we are calculating the arrows used for black ducks.

Let's reassess the logic provided:

1. Each row of ducks begins with a white duck.
2. The number of ducks in each row follows the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...), where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
3. The black ducks will alternate with the white ducks.
4. If the number of ducks in a row is even, there will be an equal number of white and black ducks.
5. If the number of ducks in a row is odd, there will be one more white duck than black ducks.

We need to ensure that the black arrows are not over-counted, especially for odd-numbered rows. Let's correct the logic and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the remaining arrows and the number of rows hunted
def calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb):
    rows_hunted = 0
    prev = 0
    current = 1

    # Hunt rows of ducks until we run out of arrows
    while ka >= current:
        rows_hunted += 1  # We will hunt this row
        ka -= current  # Use white arrows for white ducks

        # Check if there are enough black arrows for black ducks
        if kb >= current - (rows_hunted % 2):
            kb -= current - (rows_hunted % 2)  # Use black arrows for black ducks
        else:
            break  # Not enough black arrows to hunt the next row

        # Calculate the next row size using the Fibonacci sequence
        prev, current = current, prev + current

    return rows_hunted, ka, kb

# Read the arrow count from file
with open('vanatoare.in', 'r') as file:
    ka = int(file.readline().strip())
    kb = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the ducks hunted and the remaining arrows
rows_hunted, ka_rem, kb_rem = calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb)

# Write the results to file
with open('vanatoare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{rows_hunted}\n")
    file.write(f"{ka_rem}\n")
    file.write(f"{kb_rem}\n")
```

This updated solution should now correctly account for the number of black and white ducks in each row, and the arrows used for each. It should also provide the expected output for the given input, resolving the bug in the previous implementation.

It appears there is a misunderstanding in the logic used to determine the number of black arrows remaining. The program is using one less black arrow than it should for rows with an odd number of ducks, but it should use one less only for rows with an even number of ducks since each row starts with a white duck. This is why we end up with one more black arrow (5 instead of 6) than expected at the end.

We need to adjust the logic to correctly calculate the number of black arrows used for each row. For each row, the number of black arrows used should be equal to the total number of ducks minus one if the total number of ducks in the row is odd, and equal to the total number of ducks if the total number of ducks is even. Let's fix the logic accordingly and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of black arrows used for a row
def black_arrows_for_row(row_size):
    # If the row size is odd, there's one less black duck than white ones;
    # If even, the count of black and white ducks is the same.
    return row_size // 2

# Function to calculate the remaining arrows and the number of rows hunted
def calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb):
    rows_hunted = 0
    prev_white = 1  # Previous row had 1 white duck
    cur_white = 1   # Current row has 1 white duck
    arrow_used = 0

    # Hunt rows of ducks until we run out of arrows
    while ka >= cur_white and kb >= arrow_used:
        # Update the number of rows hunted
        rows_hunted += 1

        # Deduct the arrows used for the current row
        ka -= cur_white
        kb -= arrow_used

        # Prepare for the next row
        temp = cur_white
        cur_white += prev_white
        prev_white = temp
        
        # Calculate the number of black arrows to be used for the next row
        arrow_used = black_arrows_for_row(cur_white)

    return rows_hunted, ka, kb

# Read the arrow count from file
with open('vanatoare.in', 'r') as file:
    ka = int(file.readline().strip())
    kb = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the ducks hunted and the remaining arrows
rows_hunted, ka_rem, kb_rem = calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb)

# Write the results to file
with open('vanatoare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{rows_hunted}\n")
    file.write(f"{ka_rem}\n")
    file.write(f"{kb_rem}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now properly calculate the number of black arrows used for each row and maintain the correct number of remaining arrows. It should output the expected results for the given input.

The output is incorrect because the logic for calculating the number of black arrows used for each row is still not correct. The program should correctly alternate between rows starting with a white duck and ending with a black duck (even number of ducks) and rows starting and ending with a white duck (odd number of ducks).

Let's correct the logic using the following approach:
1. Start with the first row having one white duck.
2. For each row, determine the number of white and black ducks:
   - If the row number is even, it will have the same number of black ducks as white ducks.
   - If the row number is odd, it will have one less black duck than white ducks.
3. Subtract the number of white and black arrows used for each row from the total `ka` and `kb`.
4. Repeat the process until there are not enough arrows of either color to hunt an entire row.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the remaining arrows and the number of rows hunted
def calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb):
    # Initialize variables
    rows_hunted = 0
    prev_count = 0
    current_count = 1

    # Hunt rows of ducks until we run out of arrows
    while True:
        # Determine the number of white and black ducks in the current row
        white_ducks = current_count
        black_ducks = current_count - 1 if rows_hunted % 2 == 1 else current_count

        # Check if we have enough arrows to hunt the current row
        if ka >= white_ducks and kb >= black_ducks:
            # Hunt the row and update remaining arrows
            ka -= white_ducks
            kb -= black_ducks

            # Update the count for the number of rows hunted
            rows_hunted += 1

            # Prepare for the next row
            prev_count, current_count = current_count, prev_count + current_count
        else:
            # Not enough arrows left to hunt the next row
            break

    return rows_hunted, ka, kb

# Read the arrow count from file
with open('vanatoare.in', 'r') as file:
    ka = int(file.readline().strip())
    kb = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the ducks hunted and the remaining arrows
rows_hunted, ka_rem, kb_rem = calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb)

# Write the results to file
with open('vanatoare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{rows_hunted}\n")
    file.write(f"{ka_rem}\n")
    file.write(f"{kb_rem}\n")
```

Now, the program should correctly calculate the number of rows hunted and the number of remaining white and black arrows, producing the expected output.

The previous implementations had incorrect logic for managing the count of black ducks and black arrows. Given each row starts with a white duck and ducks alternate in color, for even-indexed rows (considering the first row as index 1), there will be the same number of black ducks as white ducks. For odd-indexed rows, there will be one more white duck than black ducks.

Let's implement a new solution that checks the row index to determine how many black arrows are needed for each row, and uses a Fibonacci sequence approach to count the ducks in the next row:

```python
# Function to calculate the remaining arrows and the number of rows hunted
def calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb):
    rows_hunted = 0  # Number of rows hunted
    white_ducks = 1  # White ducks in the current row
    black_ducks = 0  # Black ducks in the current row
    total_arrows = ka + kb  # Total number of arrows

    while total_arrows >= white_ducks + black_ducks and ka >= white_ducks and kb >= black_ducks:
        # Subtract the arrows used for the current row
        ka -= white_ducks
        kb -= black_ducks
        total_arrows -= (white_ducks + black_ducks)

        # Increase the number of rows hunted
        rows_hunted += 1

        # Calculate the ducks in the next row using the Fibonacci sequence
        next_row_ducks = white_ducks + black_ducks

        # Determine the number of black and white ducks for the next row
        black_ducks = white_ducks if next_row_ducks % 2 == 0 else white_ducks - 1
        white_ducks = next_row_ducks

    return rows_hunted, ka, kb

# Read the arrow count from file
with open('vanatoare.in', 'r') as file:
    ka = int(file.readline().strip())
    kb = int(file.readline().strip())

# Calculate the ducks hunted and the remaining arrows
rows_hunted, ka_rem, kb_rem = calc_ducks_and_arrows(ka, kb)

# Write the results to file
with open('vanatoare.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{rows_hunted}\n")
    file.write(f"{ka_rem}\n")
    file.write(f"{kb_rem}\n")
```

This solution should output the expected results for the given input. The logic ensures that the correct number of white and black arrows are used for each row, taking into account the total number of arrows and the pattern in which the ducks are arranged.
