Cel mai nou proiect imobiliar din capitală este compus din $N$ blocuri-turn, construite unul lângă altul, de-a lungul unui bulevard central și numerotate de la $1$ la $N$. Pentru fiecare turn se cunoaște numărul etajelor din care este compus acesta și se mai știe că nu există două turnuri cu același număr de etaje. Ultimele norme urbanistice definesc **coeficientul de frumusețe** al turnului cu numărul $T$, ca fiind numărul turnurilor din secvența de turnuri care începe cu turnul $S$, se termină cu turnul $D$ și are următoarele proprietăți:
* $1 \leq S \leq T \leq D \leq N$
* numărul etajelor fiecărui turn din secvență, cu excepţia turnului $T$, este mai mic decât numărul de etaje ale turnului $T$
* Dacă $S ≠ 1$ atunci turnul $S-1$ este cel mai apropiat turn din stânga turnului $T$, care are un număr de etaje strict mai mare decât turnul $T$
* Dacă $D ≠ N$ atunci turnul $D+1$ este cel mai apropiat turn din dreapta turnului $T$, care are un număr de etaje strict mai mare decât turnul $T$

**Coeficientul de frumusețe al întregului ansamblu de turnuri** este suma coeficienților de frumusețe avuţi de turnurile componente. Dezvoltatorul proiectului dorește să renunțe la unul dintre turnuri și să construiască în locul acestuia un restaurant subteran, acesta considerându-se un turn cu **zero** etaje. Dezvoltatorul dorește să calculeze coeficientul de frumusețe al ansamblului de turnuri, pentru fiecare posibilă amplasare a restaurantului.

# Cerință

Cunoscând numărul $N$ de turnuri și numărul etajelor fiecăruia, determinați coeficientul de frumusețe al ansamblului de turnuri pentru toate cele $N$ posibilități de amplasare ale restaurantului, pe pozițiile $1$, $2$, ..., $N$.

# Date de intrare


Datele de intrare se citesc din fişierul `turnuri.in`, care are următoarea structură:

* pe prima linie se află numărul natural $N$, reprezentând numărul de turnuri
* pe a doua linie se află $N$ valori naturale nenule, separate prin câte un spațiu, reprezentând numărul etajelor turnurilor

# Date de ieșire


Datele de ieşire se vor scrie în fişierul `turnuri.out`, pe linii separate, astfel: pe linia $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq N$) se găsește un număr natural reprezentând coeficientul de frumusețe al ansamblului dacă restaurantul s-ar construi în locul turnului $i$.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$
* Numărul de etaje ale unui turn este un număr natural între $1$ și $1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$
* Se acordă $10$ puncte din oficiu.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Importing numpy for efficient array manipulation
import numpy as np

# Read data from file

    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    heights = np.array(f.readline().split(), dtype=np.int64)

# Prepare arrays for left and right limits for each tower

right_limits = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.int64)

# Stack for tracking the index of towers
stack = []

# Compute the left limit for each tower
for i in range(N):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    # Index of the previous tower with more floors, or 0 if none
    left_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    stack.append(i)

# Clear the stack for the next computation
stack.clear()

# Compute the right limit for each tower
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    # Index of the next tower with more floors, or N-1 if none
    right_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else N
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the beauty coefficient for the whole ensemble
beauty_coef = np.sum(right_limits - left_limits - 1)

# Calculate and write the beauty coefficient for each possible restaurant position
with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
    for i in range(N):
        # Calculate the beauty coefficient when a restaurant replaces the i-th tower
        # Left limit for the current tower becomes the right limit for the previous one
        if left_limits[i] != -1:
            beauty_coef_current = beauty_coef - (right_limits[i] - i)
            # Increment the beauty if there is a valid tower to the left
            beauty_coef_current += i - left_limits[i] - 1
        else:
            beauty_coef_current = beauty_coef - (right_limits[i] - i)

        # Right limit for the current tower becomes the left limit for the next one
        if right_limits[i] != N:
            beauty_coef_current -= (i - left_limits[i])
            # Increment the beauty if there is a valid tower to the right
            beauty_coef_current += right_limits[i] - i - 1
        else:
            beauty_coef_current -= (i - left_limits[i])

        # Write the current beauty coefficient
        f.write(f'{beauty_coef_current}\n')
```

This solution reads the heights of the towers from `turnuri.in`, computes the left and right limits for each tower using two passes (left-to-right and right-to-left), calculates the initial beauty coefficient of the ensemble, and then iterates through each possible restaurant position, adjusting the beauty coefficient accordingly and writing each result to `turnuri.out`. The code is optimized for both time and memory, attempting to keep the memory usage within the 8MB limit.

The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` indicates that the `numpy` library is not installed or not available in the current execution environment. However, since this is a programming challenge that specifies using efficient libraries like `numpy`, this might be an environment setup issue.

If this is a contest environment where we cannot install external libraries or the environment does not have `numpy` installed, we'll have to rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other external libraries. In this case, I will provide a solution using only the Python standard library, ensuring it adheres to the memory constraints.

Here is the modified solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

# Prepare arrays for left and right limits for each tower
left_limits = [-1] * N
right_limits = [N] * N

# Stack for tracking the index of towers
stack = []

# Compute the left limit for each tower
for i in range(N):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    # Index of the previous tower with more floors, or -1 if none
    left_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    stack.append(i)

# Clear the stack for the next computation
stack.clear()

# Compute the right limit for each tower
for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    # Index of the next tower with more floors, or N if none
    right_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else N
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the beauty coefficient for the whole ensemble
beauty_coef = sum(right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1 for i in range(N))

# Calculate and write the beauty coefficient for each possible restaurant position
with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
    for i in range(N):
        # Calculate the beauty coefficient when a restaurant replaces the i-th tower
        # Left limit for the current tower becomes the right limit for the previous one
        if left_limits[i] != -1:
            beauty_coef_current = beauty_coef - (right_limits[i] - i)
            # Increment the beauty if there is a valid tower to the left
            beauty_coef_current += i - left_limits[i] - 1
        else:
            beauty_coef_current = beauty_coef - (right_limits[i] - i)

        # Right limit for the current tower becomes the left limit for the next one
        if right_limits[i] != N:
            beauty_coef_current -= (i - left_limits[i])
            # Increment the beauty if there is a valid tower to the right
            beauty_coef_current += right_limits[i] - i - 1
        else:
            beauty_coef_current -= (i - left_limits[i])

        # Write the current beauty coefficient
        f.write(f'{beauty_coef_current}\n')
```

This code does not use `numpy` or any other external library. Instead, it uses Python lists and built-in functions to perform the necessary calculations and adhere to the memory and efficiency constraints. The logic remains the same as the previous solution, but it is rewritten to avoid the use of `numpy`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found results indicates an error in the calculation logic. Specifically, it appears there is a mistake in how we adjust the beauty coefficient when simulating the replacement of a tower with a restaurant. When replacing a tower, we need to consider the effect this replacement has on both adjacent towers in terms of finding the nearest tower with a greater number of floors.

Let's correct the logic to properly handle this case:

1. When replacing the `i-th` tower with a restaurant, the nearest taller tower to the left of `i` becomes the new limit for all towers to the right of `i` (up to the previous right limit).
2. Similarly, the nearest taller tower to the right of `i` becomes the new limit for all towers to the left of `i` (up to the previous left limit).

We need to account for these adjustments in the calculation of the beauty coefficient. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

# Prepare arrays for left and right limits for each tower
left_limits = [-1] * N
right_limits = [N] * N

# Stack for tracking the index of towers
stack = []

# Compute the left limit for each tower
for i in range(N):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    # Index of the previous tower with more floors, or -1 if none
    left_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    stack.append(i)

# Clear the stack for the next computation
stack.clear()

# Compute the right limit for each tower
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    # Index of the next tower with more floors, or N if none
    right_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else N
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the beauty coefficient for the whole ensemble
beauty_coef = sum(right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1 for i in range(N))

# Calculate and write the beauty coefficient for each possible restaurant position
with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
    for i in range(N):
        # Adjust the beauty coefficient when a restaurant replaces the i-th tower
        decrement = 0
        increment = 0
        
        # For the tower being removed, decrement its individual contribution
        decrement += right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1
        
        # Adjust the contribution of towers to the left
        if left_limits[i] != -1:
            decrement += i - left_limits[i] - 1
            increment += right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1
        
        # Adjust the contribution of towers to the right
        if right_limits[i] != N:
            decrement += right_limits[i] - i - 1
            increment += right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1
        
        # The beauty coefficient after removing the i-th tower
        beauty_coef_current = beauty_coef - decrement + increment
        
        # Write the current beauty coefficient
        f.write(f'{beauty_coef_current}\n')
```

This corrected solution should now produce the expected output by properly accounting for changes in the left and right limits of the towers adjacent to the replaced tower and adjusting their contributions to the beauty coefficient appropriately.

The results differ from the expected output due to incorrect adjustments in the beauty coefficient calculation after replacing a tower with a restaurant. The previous solution does not correctly calculate the shift in the beauty coefficient when the view is obstructed or opened up by the replacement tower. Let's revisit the logic and correct the solution.

To correct the solution, we need to:

1. Subtract the beauty coefficient contributed by the tower being replaced.
2. Add the beauty coefficient lost by its left and right neighbors if they are obstructed by the next taller tower after the replacement.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def calculate_beauty_coefficients(N, heights):
    # Initialize left and right limits for each tower
    left_limits = [-1] * N
    right_limits = [N] * N
    
    # Stack for tracking the index of towers
    stack = []
    
    # Compute the left limit for each tower
    for i in range(N):
        while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
            stack.pop()
        left_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
        stack.append(i)

    # Clear the stack for the next computation
    stack.clear()

    # Compute the right limit for each tower
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else N
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate the initial beauty coefficient for the whole ensemble
    beauty_coef = sum(right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1 for i in range(N))
    total_beauty = beauty_coef

    # Calculate and return the beauty coefficient for each possible restaurant position
    beauty_coefs = []
    for i in range(N):
        # Calculate the beauty coefficient when a restaurant replaces the i-th tower
        loss = right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1
        gain = 0
        
        # Adjust if there is a valid tower to the left
        if left_limits[i] != -1:
            gain += i - left_limits[i] - 1
        
        # Adjust if there is a valid tower to the right
        if right_limits[i] != N:
            gain += right_limits[i] - i - 1
        
        beauty_coefs.append(total_beauty - loss + gain)
    
    return beauty_coefs

# Read data from file
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as f:
    N = int(f.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, f.readline().split()))

# Calculate the beauty coefficients
beauty_coefs = calculate_beauty_coefficients(N, heights)

# Write the beauty coefficients to the output file
with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as f:
    for coef in beauty_coefs:
        f.write(f'{coef}\n')
```

This solution should now correctly calculate the beauty coefficients according to the rules specified in the problem statement. The approach is to calculate the initial beauty coefficient of the ensemble and then adjust it for each possible restaurant position, taking into account which towers' views are obstructed or opened up by the replacement.

The result still differs from the expected output because the previous solution did not properly handle the changes in the sequence of towers when one tower is replaced with a restaurant. It seems that we are not correctly recalculating the beauty coefficient for affected towers, specifically those in between the replaced tower and the next taller towers to its left and right.

To correct the logic, we need to handle the following cases when a tower at position `i` is replaced with a restaurant:

1. Subsequent towers in the range `(left_limits[i] + 1, i)` will potentially have their right view extended to `right_limits[i]`.
2. Previous towers in the range `(i + 1, right_limits[i] - 1)` will potentially have their left view extended to `left_limits[i]`.

The updated solution should consider these adjustments in the computation of the beauty coefficient:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Prepare arrays for left and right limits for each tower
left_limits = [-1] * N
right_limits = [N] * N

# Stack for tracking the index of towers
stack = []

# Compute the left limit for each tower
for i in range(N):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    left_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    stack.append(i)

# Clear the stack for the next computation
stack.clear()

# Compute the right limit for each tower
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    right_limits[i] = stack[-1] if stack else N
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the beauty coefficient for the whole ensemble
beauty_coef = sum(right_limits[i] - left_limits[i] - 1 for i in range(N))

# Calculate and write the beauty coefficient for each possible restaurant position
with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as outfile:
    for i in range(N):
        # Calculate the beauty coefficient when a restaurant replaces the i-th tower
        current_coef = beauty_coef
        # Account for the towers in range (left_limits[i] + 1, i)
        for j in range(left_limits[i] + 1, i):
            current_coef += min(right_limits[i], right_limits[j]) - right_limits[j] - 1
        
        # Account for the towers in range (i + 1, right_limits[i] - 1)
        for j in range(i + 1, right_limits[i]):
            current_coef += left_limits[j] - max(left_limits[i], left_limits[j]) - 1
        
        # Write the current beauty coefficient
        outfile.write(f'{current_coef}\n')
```

This solution iterates over towers that could potentially have their beauty coefficients affected by the replacement of the `i-th` tower with a restaurant, adjusting the overall beauty coefficient accordingly. This approach should now handle the complexity of the interactions between towers and produce the expected output.

The previous solutions failed to correctly adjust the beauty coefficient when replacing each tower with a restaurant. The necessary adjustments were not properly made for the neighbors of the replaced tower and for all the towers influenced by the new view limits caused by the replacement.

To address this, we need to identify the nearest taller towers on both sides of each tower and calculate how the beauty coefficient changes when a tower is replaced with a restaurant. The key is to observe that when a tower is replaced, it can potentially increase the beauty coefficient of the towers on its left up to the nearest taller tower, and the same for the towers on its right.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Initialize arrays to store the next greater element indices on both sides
left_greater = [-1] * N
right_greater = [N] * N

# Compute indices of the next greater element to the left
stack = []
for i in range(N):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    left_greater[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    stack.append(i)

# Compute indices of the next greater element to the right
stack = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    right_greater[i] = stack[-1] if stack else N
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the initial beauty coefficient
beauty_coef = 0
for i in range(N):
    beauty_coef += (i - left_greater[i]) * (right_greater[i] - i)

# Calculate and write the beauty coefficients for each replacement
with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as outfile:
    for i in range(N):
        # Calculate the change in beauty coefficient when replacing the i-th tower
        left_index = left_greater[i]
        right_index = right_greater[i]
        coef = beauty_coef
        
        # Subtract the contribution of the i-th tower
        coef -= (i - left_index) * (right_index - i)
        
        # Add the contribution of the tower that would become visible to the right of the i-th neighbor
        if left_index != -1:
            coef += (i - left_index) * (right_index - left_index)
        
        # Add the contribution of the tower that would become visible to the left of the i-th neighbor
        if right_index != N:
            coef += (right_index - i) * (right_index - left_index)
        
        # Write the current beauty coefficient
        outfile.write(f'{coef}\n')

This solution should correctly calculate the beauty coefficients for each scenario where a tower is replaced by a restaurant, by considering the contributions of the current tower and the change in visibility for its neighbors.

The previous solution attempts to calculate the new beauty coefficient directly by adjusting for the visibility of towers to the left and right of the tower being replaced. However, it incorrectly calculates contributions by adding the visibility of the left and right taller towers multiple times.

To correct this, we must consider that when a tower is replaced by a restaurant (0 height), the towers to the left will have their right limit potentially increased to the nearest taller tower to the right of the replaced tower, and the towers to the right will have their left limit potentially decreased to the nearest taller tower to the left of the replaced tower.

Let's implement a solution that considers these factors:

```python
# Read data from file
with open('turnuri.in', 'r') as infile:
    N = int(infile.readline().strip())
    heights = list(map(int, infile.readline().split()))

# Initialize arrays to store the next greater element indices on both sides
left_greater = [-1] * N
right_greater = [N] * N

# Compute indices of the next greater element to the left
stack = []
for i in range(N):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    left_greater[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
    stack.append(i)

# Compute indices of the next greater element to the right
stack = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
        stack.pop()
    right_greater[i] = stack[-1] if stack else N
    stack.append(i)

# Calculate the initial beauty coefficient for the entire ensemble
initial_beauty = 0
for i in range(N):
    initial_beauty += (i - left_greater[i]) * (right_greater[i] - i)

# Calculate and write the beauty coefficients for each replacement
with open('turnuri.out', 'w') as outfile:
    for i in range(N):
        # Start with the initial beauty coefficient
        beauty_coef = initial_beauty

        # Subtract the beauty contribution of the replaced tower
        beauty_coef -= (i - left_greater[i]) * (right_greater[i] - i)

        # If there is a taller tower to the left, add the extended visibility for towers on its right
        if left_greater[i] != -1:
            beauty_coef += (i - left_greater[i]) * (right_greater[left_greater[i]] - i)

        # If there is a taller tower to the right, add the extended visibility for towers on its left
        if right_greater[i] != N:
            beauty_coef += (right_greater[i] - i) * (i - left_greater[right_greater[i]])

        # Write the current beauty coefficient
        outfile.write(f'{beauty_coef}\n')
```

In this solution, we calculate the initial beauty coefficient for the entire ensemble. Then, for each tower, we subtract the contribution of the tower being replaced and add the extended visibility contributions for its neighboring towers. This should yield the correct beauty coefficients for each replacement scenario.
