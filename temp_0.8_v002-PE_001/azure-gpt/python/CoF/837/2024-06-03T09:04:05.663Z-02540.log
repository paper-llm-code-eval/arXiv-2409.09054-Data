Andrei se descurcă foarte bine la geometrie și de aceea născocește tot felul de jocuri pe care le testează cu Alexandru, colegul său de bancă. Pentru a pregăti noul joc cu trei niveluri, Andrei desenează pe o foaie de matematică reperul cartezian xOy și mai multe puncte distincte. Fiecare punct desenat are atât abscisa $x$, cât și ordonata $y$, numere întregi.

La primul nivel, Alexandru determină numărul maxim de puncte (dintre cele desenate) aflate pe una dintre axele sistemului cartezian sau pe o dreaptă paralelă cu una dintre cele două axe.

La al doilea nivel, Alexandru consideră toate punctele desenate a căror abscisă $x$ și ordonată $y$ verifică cel puțin una dintre relațiile $x = y$ sau $x + y = 0$ și apoi calculează câte drepte distincte trec prin cel puțin două dintre aceste puncte.

La al treilea nivel, Alexandru numără și șterge punctele din $3$ în $3$ (primul, al $4$-lea, al $7$-lea etc.), începând cu cel mai din stânga punct desenat și continuând către dreapta. Dacă două sau mai multe puncte au aceeași abscisă, el le numără pe acestea de jos în sus (începând de la punctul cu ordonata cea mai mică). Când a ajuns cu număratul la cel mai din dreapta punct continuă cu cel mai din stânga punct rămas.

Alexandru se oprește cu numărarea și ștergerea când rămâne un singur punct desenat pe foaie.

The previous solution relied on using numpy, which is not available in this environment. Let's rewrite the solution using only built-in Python libraries and optimize it to meet the memory constraints. We'll remove the use of numpy and optimize memory usage:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read data from file
with open('puncte.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Step 1: Compute NRP
horizontal_counts = defaultdict(int)
vertical_counts = defaultdict(int)
for x, y in points:
    horizontal_counts[y] += 1
    vertical_counts[x] += 1

max_points = max(max(horizontal_counts.values()), max(vertical_counts.values()))

# Step 2: Compute NRD
line_counts = defaultdict(int)
for x, y in points:
    if x == y or x + y == 0:
        line_counts[(1, 1, -x)] += 1  # Line of the form x = y
        line_counts[(1, -1, x)] += 1  # Line of the form x = -y

# Subtracting one because the line x = -y is counted twice for the origin (0,0)
distinct_lines = max(0, len(line_counts) // 2 - (1 if line_counts[(1, 1, 0)] > 1 else 0))

# Step 3: Compute XP
sorted_points = sorted(set(points), key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))
index_to_remove = 2 % len(sorted_points)
while len(sorted_points) > 1:
    sorted_points.pop(index_to_remove)
    index_to_remove = (index_to_remove + 2) % len(sorted_points)

XP = sorted_points[0][0]

# Write results to file
with open('puncte.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_points}\n{distinct_lines}\n{XP}\n")
```

This solution should work without numpy and keep the memory footprint within the limits. We have used a tuple to represent the coefficients of the lines to ensure that memory usage is kept to a minimum. The sorting and elimination of points in Step 3 have also been adjusted to work with built-in data types.

Upon reviewing the solution and the expected output, it is clear that there are two issues:
1. The determination of distinct lines in step 2 is incorrect.
2. The method for determining the remaining point in step 3 does not match the specified rules.

For step 2, we need to count the number of distinct lines that can be formed by the points that lie either on the line `x = y` or `x = -y`. We can use two sets to track these lines, one for each of the two conditions.

For step 3, we need to simulate the process of counting and deleting points as specified in the problem. We can do this by iterating over the points in the specified order and removing the appropriate points until only one remains.

Let's rewrite the solution taking into account these corrections:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Step 1: Compute NRP
def compute_NRP(points):
    horizontal_counts = defaultdict(int)
    vertical_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        horizontal_counts[y] += 1
        vertical_counts[x] += 1
    return max(max(horizontal_counts.values()), max(vertical_counts.values()))

# Step 2: Compute NRD
def compute_NRD(points):
    lines_xy = set()
    lines_x_neg_y = set()
    for x, y in points:
        if x == y:
            lines_xy.add((1, -1, 0))  # y = x => 1*x - 1*y + 0 = 0
        elif x == -y:
            lines_x_neg_y.add((1, 1, 0))  # y = -x => 1*x + 1*y + 0 = 0
    return len(lines_xy) + len(lines_x_neg_y)

# Step 3: Compute XP
def compute_XP(points):
    sorted_points = sorted(set(points))
    while len(sorted_points) > 1:
        # Remove every third point (0-indexed, so indices 2, 5, 8, etc.)
        indices_to_remove = range(2, len(sorted_points), 3)
        sorted_points = [p for i, p in enumerate(sorted_points) if i not in indices_to_remove]
    return sorted_points[0][0]

# Read data from file
with open('puncte.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Compute NRP, NRD, and XP
NRP = compute_NRP(points)
NRD = compute_NRD(points)
XP = compute_XP(points)

# Write results to file
with open('puncte.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n")
```

This solution addresses the issues from the previous code. For NRD, we use sets to track lines and avoid double-counting the line formed by points on both `x = y` and `x = -y`. For XP, we simulate the removal process precisely as described. This updated solution should give the expected output for the provided example and other cases as well.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed because it exceeded the memory limit or due to an explicit kill command. Since there were no explicit kill commands and the standard output and standard error do not show any error messages, it's likely that the solution exceeded the memory usage limit.

The memory issue might be caused by constructing the large `indices_to_remove` list, which can use a significant amount of memory for large `N`. Additionally, the list comprehension that creates a new list without the removed items can also be memory-intensive. To fix this, we should try to avoid creating big temporary lists and optimize the deletion process to be more memory-efficient.

Let's try a different approach for step 3 to avoid the memory issue. We can iteratively remove every third point by incrementing a counter and using modulo to determine if it's a third point without storing their indices.

Here's the optimized solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Step 1: Compute NRP
def compute_NRP(points):
    horizontal_counts = defaultdict(int)
    vertical_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        horizontal_counts[y] += 1
        vertical_counts[x] += 1
    return max(max(horizontal_counts.values()), max(vertical_counts.values()))

# Step 2: Compute NRD
def compute_NRD(points):
    pos_diagonal = set()
    neg_diagonal = set()
    for x, y in points:
        if x == y:
            pos_diagonal.add(x)
        elif x == -y:
            neg_diagonal.add(x)
    # Each unique x on the diagonal represents a unique line, so count them
    return len(pos_diagonal) + len(neg_diagonal)

# Step 3: Compute XP
def compute_XP(points):
    sorted_points = sorted(set(points))
    index = 0  # Starting index for removal
    while len(sorted_points) > 1:
        # Calculate the next index to remove after each removal
        index = (index + 2) % len(sorted_points)
        sorted_points.pop(index)
        # Adjust the index for the next iteration due to the removal
        index -= 1
        # If the index is negative, wrap it to the end of the list
        if index < 0:
            index += len(sorted_points)
    return sorted_points[0][0]

# Read data from file
with open('puncte.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    points = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]

# Compute NRP, NRD, and XP
NRP = compute_NRP(points)
NRD = compute_NRD(points)
XP = compute_XP(points)

# Write results to file
with open('puncte.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n")
```

This solution avoids creating extra lists and should be more memory-efficient, potentially solving the memory issue that caused the exit code 137.

After reviewing the output, it appears that the logic for computing XP is not correct. The removal process must follow a specific pattern that is not accurately reflected in the current implementation. We need to ensure that after a point is removed, counting picks up from the subsequent point in the sorted list, wrapping around if necessary.

Let's correct the logic for computing XP:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

# Step 1: Compute NRP
def compute_NRP(points):
    vertical_lines = Counter(x for x, y in points)
    horizontal_lines = Counter(y for x, y in points)
    max_points_on_line = max(vertical_lines.values() + horizontal_lines.values())
    return max_points_on_line

# Step 2: Compute NRD
def compute_NRD(points):
    diagonal_count = 0
    anti_diagonal_count = 0
    for x, y in points:
        if x == y:
            diagonal_count += 1
        elif x == -y:
            anti_diagonal_count += 1

    # We can form a line if we have at least two points on it
    diagonal_lines = 1 if diagonal_count >= 2 else 0
    anti_diagonal_lines = 1 if anti_diagonal_count >= 2 else 0
    return diagonal_lines + anti_diagonal_lines

# Step 3: Compute XP
def compute_XP(points):
    sorted_points = sorted(points)
    while len(sorted_points) > 1:
        # Every third point (index 2, 5, ...) will be removed
        removal_indices = {i for i in range(2, len(sorted_points), 3)}
        # Keep only the points that are not removed
        sorted_points = [p for i, p in enumerate(sorted_points) if i not in removal_indices]
        
    return sorted_points[0][0]

# Read data from file
points = []
with open('puncte.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(N):
        points.append(tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())))

# Compute NRP, NRD, and XP
NRP = compute_NRP(points)
NRD = compute_NRD(points)
XP = compute_XP(points)

# Write results to file
with open('puncte.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, the computation of XP properly simulates the removal process as specified. Points are removed in the correct order, and the process continues with the next point immediately after the one that has been removed, wrapping to the beginning of the list as needed. This should fix the issue with computing XP and yield the expected result.

The error is caused by trying to perform addition (`+`) between two `dict_values` objects, which isn't supported in Python. To fix this, we need to combine the values into a single list before calling `max()`.

Let's correct this in the `compute_NRP()` function:

```python
# Step 1: Compute NRP
def compute_NRP(points):
    vertical_lines = Counter(x for x, y in points)
    horizontal_lines = Counter(y for x, y in points)
    max_points_on_line = max(list(vertical_lines.values()) + list(horizontal_lines.values()))
    return max_points_on_line
```

We also need to fix the counting process in step 3. The previous implementation was still not compliant with the problem statement, as it didn't consider the left-to-right and bottom-to-top order specified. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Step 1: Compute NRP
def compute_NRP(points):
    vertical_counts = defaultdict(int)
    horizontal_counts = defaultdict(int)
    
    for x, y in points:
        vertical_counts[x] += 1
        horizontal_counts[y] += 1
    
    max_points = max(max(vertical_counts.values()), max(horizontal_counts.values()))
    return max_points

# Step 2: Compute NRD
def compute_NRD(points):
    pos_diagonal = set()
    neg_diagonal = set()
    
    for x, y in points:
        if x == y:
            pos_diagonal.add(x)
        elif x == -y:
            neg_diagonal.add(x)
    
    return len(pos_diagonal) + len(neg_diagonal)

# Step 3: Compute XP
def compute_XP(points):
    sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))
    while len(sorted_points) > 1:
        index_to_remove = (2 % len(sorted_points))
        while index_to_remove < len(sorted_points):
            sorted_points.pop(index_to_remove)
            index_to_remove += 2
            if index_to_remove >= len(sorted_points):
                index_to_remove -= len(sorted_points)
    
    return sorted_points[0][0]

# Read data from file
points = []
with open('puncte.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(N):
        points.append(tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())))

# Compute NRP, NRD, and XP
NRP = compute_NRP(points)
NRD = compute_NRD(points)
XP = compute_XP(points)

# Write results to file
with open('puncte.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n")
```

In this solution, we use `defaultdict` for counting and storing line occurrences and `Counter` is no longer used. We also ensure that step 3's elimination process is memory-efficient, removing points while iterating through the sorted list based on the specified rules. This should now correctly compute `XP` and adhere to the memory constraints.

Upon reviewing the provided output and expected output, the discrepancy is still present in the `compute_XP` function's logic. The elimination process is not correctly implemented according to the game rules described in the problem statement.

Let's carefully rewrite the `compute_XP` function to better simulate the elimination game as described. We need to ensure that points are counted and removed in the correct order, taking wrapping into account, and that we correctly handle the count after a point is removed.

Here is the corrected implementation, with particular attention to step 3 (compute XP):

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Step 1: Compute NRP
def compute_NRP(points):
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for x, y in points:
        # Count the points on each unique x (vertical line) and y (horizontal line)
        counts[('x', x)] += 1
        counts[('y', y)] += 1
    # The number of points on the most populated line is the max count
    max_points = max(counts.values())
    return max_points

# Step 2: Compute NRD
def compute_NRD(points):
    # Two sets to keep track of points on the two diagonals
    diagonal = set()
    anti_diagonal = set()
    for x, y in points:
        if x == y:
            diagonal.add(x)
        elif x + y == 0:
            anti_diagonal.add(x)
    # Each x in a diagonal set represents a distinct line
    return len(diagonal) + len(anti_diagonal)

# Step 3: Compute XP
def compute_XP(points):
    # Sort the points first by x, then by y
    points.sort(key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))
    while len(points) > 1:
        # Remove every third point starting from the 0th index
        for i in range(2, len(points), 3):
            points.pop(i)
            # After a removal, the indices of subsequent points shift
            # So we need to adjust the index for next removal
            i -= 1
        # Wrap around the removal process
        points = points[i % len(points):] + points[:i % len(points)]
    return points[0][0]

# Read data from file
points = []
with open('puncte.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(N):
        points.append(tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())))

# Compute NRP, NRD, and XP
NRP = compute_NRP(points)
NRD = compute_NRD(points)
XP = compute_XP(points)

# Write results to file
with open('puncte.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{NRP}\n{NRD}\n{XP}\n")
```

This solution should now properly simulate the elimination process by removing every third point and wrapping around as necessary. It should produce the expected output for the given input data and also for other test cases while respecting the memory constraints.
