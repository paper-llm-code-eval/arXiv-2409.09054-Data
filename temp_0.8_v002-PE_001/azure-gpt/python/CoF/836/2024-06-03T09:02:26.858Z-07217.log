Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` indicates that the `numpy` library is not available in the execution environment. Since the challenge requires optimizing both time and memory usage and suggests using highly efficient libraries, it's implied that `numpy` should be available. However, if it's not possible to use `numpy`, we'll need to solve the problem without external libraries.

To fix the program, I will rewrite the solution in plain Python without using `numpy` or any other external libraries. This will ensure compatibility with environments that do not have these libraries installed.

Here's the updated code:

```python
# maxp_solution.py

def compute_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    power = [0] * n
    stack = []

    # Compute the right intervals for each element
    right = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right[i] = n - i - 1 if not stack else stack[-1] - i - 1
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    # Compute the left intervals and total power for each element
    left = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        left[i] = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
        power[i] = (left[i] + 1) * (right[i] + 1)
        stack.append(i)

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute the power array
power = compute_power(arr)

# Find the max power and the count of elements with max power
max_power = max(power)
count_max_power = power.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This code block should now be able to run without external dependencies, adhering to the memory limit and efficiently solving the challenge.

Based on the error message, it looks like the program did not correctly calculate the max power and the count of elements with the max power. The discrepancy suggests that there might be a bug in the `compute_power` function, which calculates the power for each element.

After reviewing the function, it seems I misunderstood the logic for calculating the power of each element. The power of an element is determined by the number of non-empty subsequences where the element is strictly greater than all other elements in those subsequences. This means the power is a product of the number of elements to the left plus itself and the number of elements to the right plus itself where the element in question is the maximum. In the first version of the code, there are mistakes in the way the left and right intervals are being computed.

Let's fix the code by applying a correct algorithm:

```python
# maxp_solution.py

def compute_power(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    power = [0] * n
    stack = []

    # Compute the number of elements to the right for which arr[i] is the maximum
    right = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        count = 1
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            count += right[stack[-1]] + 1
            stack.pop()
        right[i] = count - 1
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    # Compute the number of elements to the left for which arr[i] is the maximum
    left = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        count = 1
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            count += left[stack[-1]] + 1
            stack.pop()
        left[i] = count - 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Compute the total power for each element
    for i in range(n):
        power[i] = (left[i] + 1) * (right[i] + 1)

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute the power array
power = compute_power(arr)

# Find the max power and the count of elements with max power
max_power = max(power)
count_max_power = power.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly compute the number of elements to the left and to the right for which each element is the maximum, and hence the power of each element. It should also generate the expected output given the input data.

The issue seems to be with the calculation of the total power for each element. The previous solution incorrectly assumes that we can simply multiply the left and right counts to get the power, but this results in double-counting some sequences where the element is not the maximum. Each element's power is the number of subsequences in which it is the maximum, so we need to account for the fact that some subsequences may not be unique when we simply multiply.

To correctly calculate the power:

- We need to consider the number of subsequences to the left of the current element where it's the maximum (`left_count`).
- We need to consider the number of subsequences to the right of the current element where it's the maximum (`right_count`).
- The total power is not just the product of `left_count` and `right_count`. Instead, we must add the products of `left_count` with 1 (for each individual subsequence on the right) and `right_count` with 1 (for each individual subsequence on the left) and then subtract the overcounted subsequences where the element is not alone (since we've added them twice).

Let's reimplement the solution with a correct algorithm:

```python
# maxp_solution.py

def compute_power(arr, n):
    power = [0] * n
    stack = []
    left = [0] * n
    right = [0] * n

    # Calculate the number of consecutive elements before the current one
    # that are less than the current element
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        left[i] = i - stack[-1] if stack else i + 1
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    # Calculate the number of consecutive elements after the current one
    # that are less than or equal to the current element
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right[i] = stack[-1] - i if stack else n - i
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate the power for each element
    for i in range(n):
        # The total power is the number of unique subsequences where the element is maximum
        power[i] = left[i] * right[i]

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute the power array
power = compute_power(arr, n)

# Find the max power and the count of elements with max power
max_power = max(power)
count_max_power = power.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now accurately compute the power of each element and yield the expected results.

The previous solution still contains an error in the power calculation. According to the problem statement, the power of an element `arr[i]` is the number of subsequences where `arr[i]` is strictly the greatest element. My previous solution did not correctly address the duplication problem in subsequences when an element appears more than once.

Let's fix the code by correctly calculating the power of each element. This includes the left and right intervals where `arr[i]` is the greatest element. For each element `arr[i]`, we need to consider the nearest greater elements to the left and right to bound the subsequences where `arr[i]` is the maximum.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# maxp_solution.py

def compute_intervals(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize arrays to store the nearest greater element to the left (ngl) and right (ngr)
    ngl = [-1] * n
    ngr = [n] * n

    stack = []
    
    # Find the nearest greater element on the left for each element
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        ngl[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    # Find the nearest greater element on the right for each element
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        ngr[i] = stack[-1] if stack else n
        stack.append(i)

    return ngl, ngr

def compute_power(arr, ngl, ngr, n):
    power = [0] * n

    # Calculate the power of each element
    for i in range(n):
        left = i - ngl[i]
        right = ngr[i] - i
        # Each element's power is the number of subarrays it can form where it's the max
        power[i] = left * right - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude the subarray that only includes the element itself

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the nearest greater elements to the left and right for each element
ngl, ngr = compute_intervals(arr)

# Compute the power array
power = compute_power(arr, ngl, ngr, n)

# Find the max power and the count of elements with max power
max_power = max(power)
count_max_power = power.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This code should now accurately calculate the left and right intervals for each element where it is the maximum, and it should account for the case when an element is equal to itself on the right. It should provide the expected output based on the input data.

The discrepancy between the expected output and the found output suggests that the power calculation has an off-by-one error or a similar issue. Upon closer inspection of the previous solution, I see that there is a mistake in the computation of the power of each element. The subtraction of 1 to exclude the subarray that only includes the element itself is not correct, as we actually want to count that subarray where the element is alone.

To fix the implementation, we should not subtract 1 when computing the power of each element.

Here is the corrected algorithm:

```python
# maxp_solution.py

# Function to compute nearest greater elements to the left and right for each element
def compute_intervals(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    nearest_greater_left = [-1] * n
    nearest_greater_right = [n] * n

    # Stack to keep track of indices while iterating for nearest greater left elements
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            nearest_greater_left[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    # Stack to keep track of indices while iterating for nearest greater right elements
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            nearest_greater_right[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)

    return nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right

# Function to compute the power of each element in the array
def compute_power(arr, nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right):
    n = len(arr)
    power = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        left = i - nearest_greater_left[i]
        right = nearest_greater_right[i] - i
        # Multiplying the possible left and right subarrays where arr[i] is the maximum
        power[i] = left * right

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate nearest greater elements to the left and right for each element
nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right = compute_intervals(arr)

# Compute the power array
power = compute_power(arr, nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right)

The discrepancy in the output indicates a flaw in the logic for computing the power of each element. The previous method incorrectly calculated the number of unique subsequences in which each element is the maximum. Given that duplicated elements (`7` in the provided input) are treated equally, when computing power for an element `arr[i]`, we must ensure that the element to its right is strictly greater, not equal, to count correctly.

To fix this, we must adjust the logic for computing the nearest greater element to the right (`ngr`). It should consider strictly greater elements, not greater than or equal. This will ensure that we count subsequences correctly, especially in cases where an element is repeated.

Here's the revised solution with the corrected logic:

```python
# maxp_solution.py

# Function to compute nearest strictly greater elements to the left and right for each element
def compute_intervals(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    nearest_greater_left = [-1] * n
    nearest_greater_right = [n] * n

    # Stack to keep track of indices while iterating for nearest greater left elements
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            nearest_greater_left[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()

    # Stack to keep track of indices while iterating for nearest strictly greater right elements
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            nearest_greater_right[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)

    return nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right

# Function to compute the power of each element in the array
def compute_power(arr, nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right):
    n = len(arr)
    power = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        # Distance to nearest strictly greater element on the left
        left_span = i if nearest_greater_left[i] == -1 else i - nearest_greater_left[i] - 1
        # Distance to nearest strictly greater element on the right
        right_span = n - 1 - i if nearest_greater_right[i] == n else nearest_greater_right[i] - i - 1
        # Compute the power of the element as the product of spans
        power[i] = (left_span + 1) * (right_span + 1)

    return power

# Read from maxp.in
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate nearest greater elements to the left and strictly greater to the right
nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right = compute_intervals(arr)

# Compute the power array
power = compute_power(arr, nearest_greater_left, nearest_greater_right)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with the maximum power
max_power = max(power)
count_max_power = power.count(max_power)

# Write to maxp.out
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This adjusted solution should now consider strictly greater elements when calculating the power, which should provide the correct count of unique subsequences and the expected output.
