Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 200 \ 000$;
* Elementele șirului sunt numere naturale și au cel mult $6$ cifre
* Se acordă 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea corectă a celei mai mari puteri a unui element din șir și 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea numărului de elemente din şir care au cea mai mare putere.

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[i] > arr[stack[-1]]:
            idx = stack.pop()
            right[idx] = stack[-1] - idx if stack else n - idx
        stack.append(i)
    
    # The power of an element is the product of the number of elements before and after it
    # that are less than or equal to it.
    powers = left * right
    max_power = powers.max()
    count_max_power = np.count_nonzero(powers == max_power)
    
    return max_power, count_max_power

# Read the input data
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    arr = np.array(list(map(int, file.readline().split())), dtype=np.int64)

# Calculate the max power and count of elements with max power
max_power, count_max_power = calculate_power(arr)

# Write the output data
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```
```

This solution uses `numpy` for efficient array operations and computational performance. The `calculate_power` function finds the left and right arrays that count the number of consecutive elements less than the current element on both sides, then calculates the power for each element using a product. The final step is to output the maximum power and the count of elements with that power to `maxp.out`. The solution should meet the challenge requirements, optimizing for both time and memory usage, and respecting the memory limit.

It seems that the environment in which the code is run does not have the `numpy` library installed, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`. Given that the memory constraint suggests a requirement for an efficient solution, the use of `numpy` was intended to optimize memory usage. However, since `numpy` is not available, I will implement a solution that does not rely on external libraries. Here is the revised solution using vanilla Python:

```python
# Calculate the power of an element based on the given sequence
def calculate_power(sequence):
    len_sequence = len(sequence)
    left_counts = [0] * len_sequence
    right_counts = [0] * len_sequence
    stack = []

    # Calculate left counts
    for i in range(len_sequence):
        while stack and sequence[i] > sequence[stack[-1]]:
            stack.pop()
        left_counts[i] = i - stack[-1] if stack else i + 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Reset stack for calculating right counts
    stack = []

    # Calculate right counts
    for i in range(len_sequence - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and sequence[i] >= sequence[stack[-1]]:
            idx = stack.pop()
            right_counts[idx] = stack[-1] - idx if stack else len_sequence - idx
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate powers by multiplying left and right counts for each element
    powers = [left_counts[i] * right_counts[i] for i in range(len_sequence)]
    max_power = max(powers)
    count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

    return max_power, count_max_power

# Read input from 'maxp.in'
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as input_file:
    n = int(input_file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, input_file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power, count_max_power = calculate_power(sequence)

# Write the result to 'maxp.out'
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This version of the solution uses only built-in Python data structures and functionalities, ensuring that the absence of `numpy` or any other external library will not cause any issues. It should also be efficient enough to handle the given constraints, although it may not be as optimized in memory usage as the `numpy`-based solution.

The difference between the expected and found result suggests that there is an issue with how the solution is calculating the count of elements that have the maximum power. It's possible that the issue lies in the logic for calculating the right_counts, particularly with the comparison `sequence[i] >= sequence[stack[-1]]` which might be incorrect as it allows for equality, whereas we only want to consider sequences where the current element is strictly greater than the following elements.

Let's fix the bug in the right counts calculation by changing the condition from `sequence[i] >= sequence[stack[-1]]` to `sequence[i] > sequence[stack[-1]]`. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Calculate the power of an element based on the given sequence
def calculate_power(sequence):
    len_sequence = len(sequence)
    left_counts = [0] * len_sequence
    right_counts = [0] * len_sequence
    stack = []

    # Calculate left counts
    for i in range(len_sequence):
        while stack and sequence[i] > sequence[stack[-1]]:
            stack.pop()
        left_counts[i] = i - stack[-1] if stack else i + 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Reset stack for calculating right counts
    stack = []

    # Calculate right counts
    for i in range(len_sequence - 1, -1, -1):
        # NOTE: Adjust the condition to ensure it's strictly greater
        while stack and sequence[i] > sequence[stack[-1]]:
            idx = stack.pop()
            right_counts[idx] = stack[-1] - idx if stack else len_sequence - idx
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate powers by multiplying left and right counts for each element
    powers = [left_counts[i] * right_counts[i] for i in range(len_sequence)]
    max_power = max(powers)
    count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

    return max_power, count_max_power

# Read input from 'maxp.in'
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as input_file:
    n = int(input_file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, input_file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power, count_max_power = calculate_power(sequence)

# Write the result to 'maxp.out'
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

The corrected condition in the right counts calculation ensures that we accurately count the number of sequences where the current element is the maximum. This change should lead to the correct output matching the expected results.

The discrepancy in the results indicates there is still a bug in the calculation of the powers, specifically concerning the handling of consecutive elements with the same value. In the given input, `7` appears twice consecutively, and the current logic in the right counts calculation does not correctly handle this scenario. When we have consecutive elements with the same value, the element on the left should be considered the maximum for sequences including both elements, as the problem statement does not define the power for equal elements.

To fix this, we need to adjust the code to ensure that for consecutive elements with the same value, only the first one is considered for the right count calculation. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Calculate the power of an element based on the given sequence
def calculate_power(sequence):
    len_sequence = len(sequence)
    left_counts = [0] * len_sequence
    right_counts = [0] * len_sequence
    stack = []

    # Calculate left counts
    for i in range(len_sequence):
        while stack and sequence[i] >= sequence[stack[-1]]:
            stack.pop()
        left_counts[i] = i - stack[-1] if stack else i + 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Reset stack for calculating right counts
    stack = []

    # Calculate right counts
    for i in range(len_sequence - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and sequence[i] > sequence[stack[-1]]:
            idx = stack.pop()
            right_counts[idx] = stack[-1] - idx if stack else len_sequence - idx
        stack.append(i)
    
    # For elements with the same value, only the first one is considered for the right count
    for i in range(len_sequence - 1):
        if sequence[i] == sequence[i + 1]:
            right_counts[i] = 0

    # Calculate powers by multiplying left and right counts for each element
    powers = [left_counts[i] * right_counts[i] for i in range(len_sequence)]
    max_power = max(powers)
    count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

    return max_power, count_max_power

# Read input from 'maxp.in'
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as input_file:
    n = int(input_file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, input_file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power, count_max_power = calculate_power(sequence)

# Write the result to 'maxp.out'
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

This solution zeroes out the right counts for elements that are immediately followed by an element with the same value, ensuring that only the first occurrence of such elements is considered in the power calculation. This should now correctly handle the input scenario and provide the expected output.

Upon re-evaluating the logic, it seems the previous fix to address elements with the same value was incorrect. The problem requires counting the power of each element where it is strictly the maximum in any non-empty subsequence containing it. For consecutive elements with the same value, each should be treated as the maximum in distinct subsequences to the left or right but not both. The error was setting the right_counts of consecutive equal elements to 0, which is incorrect because they can still be the maximum in subsequences to their left.

Let's reimplement the solution with the correct logic:

```python
# Helper function to calculate the number of subsequences to the left of each element
# where it is the maximum.
def calculate_left_counts(sequence):
    stack = []
    left_counts = [0] * len(sequence)

    for i, num in enumerate(sequence):
        count = 1
        while stack and stack[-1][0] < num:
            count += stack.pop()[1]
        left_counts[i] = count
        stack.append((num, count))
    
    return left_counts

# Helper function to calculate the number of subsequences to the right of each element
# where it is the maximum.
def calculate_right_counts(sequence):
    stack = []
    right_counts = [0] * len(sequence)

    for i in range(len(sequence) - 1, -1, -1):
        num = sequence[i]
        count = 1
        while stack and stack[-1][0] <= num:
            count += stack.pop()[1]
        right_counts[i] = count
        stack.append((num, count))
    
    return right_counts

# Calculate the power of each element and find the maximum power and its frequency.
def calculate_power(sequence):
    left_counts = calculate_left_counts(sequence)
    right_counts = calculate_right_counts(sequence)

    powers = [left * right for left, right in zip(left_counts, right_counts)]
    max_power = max(powers)
    count_max_power = powers.count(max_power)

    return max_power, count_max_power

# Read input from 'maxp.in'
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as input_file:
    n = int(input_file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, input_file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power, count_max_power = calculate_power(sequence)

# Write the result to 'maxp.out'
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(f"{max_power}\n{count_max_power}\n")
```

In this solution, `calculate_left_counts` and `calculate_right_counts` are helper functions that compute the number of subsequences to the left and right of each element where it is the maximum. The main function, `calculate_power`, uses these counts to compute the power of each element, identifies the maximum power, and counts how many times this maximum power occurs in the sequence.

This implementation should now correctly calculate the powers and thus provide the expected output for the given input.
