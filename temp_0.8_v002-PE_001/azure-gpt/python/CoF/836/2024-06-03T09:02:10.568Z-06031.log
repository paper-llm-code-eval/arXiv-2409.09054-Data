Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Restricții și precizări

* Elementele șirului sunt numere naturale și au cel mult $6$ cifre
* Se acordă 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea corectă a celei mai mari puteri a unui element din șir și 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea numărului de elemente din şir care au cea mai mare putere.

Given the memory limitations and the `ModuleNotFoundError` for Numpy, I will rewrite the solution without using Numpy or any other external libraries that are not included in the Python Standard Library. This will ensure compatibility and adherence to the memory constraints.

Here is the corrected solution using only built-in Python data structures:

```python
def calculate_power(sequence):
    stack = []
    power = [0] * len(sequence)
    
    # Calculate the left limit for each element where it is the maximum
    for i, num in enumerate(sequence):
        while stack and sequence[stack[-1]] < num:
            stack.pop()
        left_limit = stack[-1] if stack else -1
        stack.append(i)
        power[i] += i - left_limit
    
    stack.clear()
    
    # Calculate the right limit for each element where it is the maximum
    for i in range(len(sequence) - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and sequence[stack[-1]] <= sequence[i]:
            idx = stack.pop()
            power[idx] += idx - i - 1
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Add the right limits for the remaining elements
    while stack:
        idx = stack.pop()
        power[idx] += idx - (len(sequence) if stack else -1) - 1

    # Find the largest power and the count of elements with that power
    max_power = max(power)
    max_power_count = power.count(max_power)
    
    return max_power, max_power_count

# Read from 'maxp.in'
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power, max_power_count = calculate_power(sequence)

# Write to 'maxp.out'
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{max_power_count}\n")
```

This solution avoids using Numpy and instead relies on lists, which should be within the memory constraints for the problem. It also uses the same stack-based algorithm to calculate the power of each element and finally outputs the results to the specified file.

The discrepancy in the results arises from an incorrect calculation of the power of each element in the sequence. The previous algorithm did not correctly account for the number of subarrays in which each element is strictly the largest. The calculation of the left and right limits was incorrect and did not properly determine the number of sequences where each element is the maximum.

Let's reimplement the solution with a correct algorithm. To find the power of each element, we need to know how many subarrays it is the maximum of. To do this, we can use a monotonic stack to keep track of elements and their indices, and calculate the number of subarrays extending to the left and right of each element where it is the maximum.

Here's the updated solution:

```python
def calculate_power(sequence):
    # Monotonic stack holds tuples of (element, index, count)
    stack = []
    power = [0] * len(sequence)
    
    # Calculate the power for each element by finding the number of subarrays
    # for which it is the maximum
    for i, num in enumerate(sequence):
        count = 1
        # Pop elements from the stack while current element is greater
        while stack and stack[-1][0] < num:
            count += stack.pop()[2]
        # If current element equals the top of the stack, merge counts
        if stack and stack[-1][0] == num:
            count += stack[-1][2]
            stack.pop()
        power[i] += count
        stack.append((num, i, count))
    
    # Handle the right side
    stack.clear()
    for i in reversed(range(len(sequence))):
        num = sequence[i]
        count = 1
        while stack and stack[-1][0] <= num:
            count += stack.pop()[2]
        # Subtract 1 as the element itself was counted twice (left and right)
        power[i] += count - 1
        stack.append((num, i, count))
    
    # Find the largest power and the count of elements with that power
    max_power = max(power)
    max_power_count = power.count(max_power)
    
    return max_power, max_power_count

# Read from 'maxp.in'
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power, max_power_count = calculate_power(sequence)

# Write to 'maxp.out'
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{max_power_count}\n")
```

This solution maintains a stack of elements and their associated counts. The counts represent the number of contiguous subsequences extending to the left of the current position where the stack's top element is the maximum. The right side is handled similarly, and the final power is calculated by summing the left and right counts for each element minus one (as the element itself is counted in both). This should give us the correct maximum power and its count for the given sequence.

The previous solution still has an issue with the calculation of the power. It seems that it does not correctly count all valid subarrays for which an element is the maximum. The main challenge is to calculate the number of possible subarrays where each element is the maximum. This requires keeping track of the left and right bounds for each element where it is the greatest.

Let's fix the algorithm. We'll keep a stack to maintain the indices of the elements in decreasing order and use it to find the number of subarrays where each element is the maximum. For each element, we'll calculate the number of subarrays to the left and right that it can extend to, while still being the maximum. The product of these counts (minus one, to avoid double-counting the element itself) will give us the power for each element.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_power(sequence):
    # Stack to maintain elements in decreasing order
    stack = []
    # Arrays to store the left and right extensions for each element
    left_extension = [0] * len(sequence)
    right_extension = [0] * len(sequence)
    
    # Calculate left extensions
    for i, value in enumerate(sequence):
        # Pop smaller elements
        while stack and sequence[stack[-1]] < value:
            stack.pop()
        left_extension[i] = i + 1 if not stack else i - stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
    
    stack.clear()
    
    # Calculate right extensions
    for i in range(len(sequence) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Pop smaller or equal elements since we need strictly greater
        while stack and sequence[stack[-1]] <= sequence[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right_extension[i] = len(sequence) - i if not stack else stack[-1] - i
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Calculate power for each element and find the maximum power
    powers = [left_extension[i] * right_extension[i] for i in range(len(sequence))]
    max_power = max(powers)
    max_power_count = powers.count(max_power)
    
    return max_power, max_power_count

# Read from 'maxp.in'
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    sequence = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power, max_power_count = calculate_max_power(sequence)

# Write to 'maxp.out'
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{max_power_count}\n")
```

This re-implemented solution correctly calculates the left and right extensions for each element, which then allows it to accurately determine the number of subarrays where the element is the maximum. It then calculates the power by multiplying the left and right extensions for each element and finds the maximum power and its count. This corrected solution should now provide the expected output.
