Considerăm un șir de numere $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. O secvență nevidă în acest șir este de forma $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_j$, unde $i \leq j$. De exemplu, pentru $N = 4$ și șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$, secvențele nevide sunt: $2, 2 \ 3, 2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4, 4 \ 3, 3$. Definim puterea unui element $a_i$ ca fiind numărul de secvențe care-l conțin pe $a_i$ și în care $a_i$ este strict mai mare decât celelalte elemente ale fiecăreia dintre respectivele secvențe. Astfel în șirul $2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3$ puterea elementului $a_1$ este $1$ (fiind maxim doar în secvența formată din el însuși), a elementului $a_2$ este $2$ ($a_2$ fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3$ și $3$), a elementului $a_3$ este $6$ (fiind maxim în secvențele $2 \ 3 \ 4, 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 3, 3 \ 4, 3 \ 4 \ 3, 4$ și $4 \ 3$), iar a elementului $a_4$ este $1$.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care determină puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat, precum și numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul `maxp.in` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $N$, iar pe a doua linie, în ordine, numerele naturale $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ separate prin câte un spațiu.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `maxp.out` va conține pe prima linie un număr natural ce reprezintă puterea cea mai mare a unui element din șirul dat și pe a doua linie va conține un număr natural ce reprezintă numărul de elemente din șir care au cea mai mare putere.

# Restricții și precizări

* $2 \leq N \leq 200 \ 000$;
* Elementele șirului sunt numere naturale și au cel mult $6$ cifre
* Se acordă 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea corectă a celei mai mari puteri a unui element din șir și 50% din punctaj pentru determinarea numărului de elemente din şir care au cea mai mare putere.

powers = (left_greater + 1) * (right_greater + 1) - 1

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{power_count}\n")
```

Please note that this solution makes use of the `numpy` library for array operations and assumes that the input file `maxp.in` exists and is properly formatted according to the problem's specifications. Similarly, the output is written to `maxp.out` as requested. The algorithm used is optimized for both time and memory, using a stack-based approach to calculate the number of subsequences efficiently. It avoids the use of `input()` and `print()` in compliance with the constraints provided.

The error indicates that the `numpy` library is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the problem description requires the use of highly efficient libraries and mentions `numpy`, I will assume that we expect it to be present. However, if we cannot use `numpy` due to this issue, we need to rewrite the solution using only the standard libraries available in Python.

While `numpy` is more memory efficient for large arrays than standard Python lists, I will write a solution that minimizes memory usage as much as possible without `numpy`.

Here's the updated solution without `numpy`:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of subsequences where each element is the maximum
def calculate_powers(array):
    N = len(array)
    left_greater = [0] * N
    right_greater = [0] * N

    stack = []
    for i in range(N):
        count = 1
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] <= array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            count += left_greater[index]
            left_greater[index] = count - 1
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()
    for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
        count = 1
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] < array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            count += right_greater[index]
            right_greater[index] = count - 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Clear the stack for elements that never found a greater element to the right
    while stack:
        index = stack.pop()
        right_greater[index] = count - 1

    powers = [(l + 1) * (r + 1) - 1 for l, r in zip(left_greater, right_greater)]
    return powers

# Read data from file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute powers without numpy
powers = calculate_powers(array)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
power_count = powers.count(max_power)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{power_count}\n")
```

Please note that the maximum memory usage is determined by the size of the input array and the auxiliary arrays used for the left and right counts. The size of the input is capped at 200,000 elements, which should be within the ~8MB memory limit. The algorithm used is efficient in terms of time complexity, and by using list comprehensions and the built-in `max` and `count` functions, it avoids unnecessary memory usage.

Upon reviewing the code, I've identified the bug in the last section of the `calculate_powers` function. Specifically, the line `right_greater[index] = count - 1` is incorrect. We need to set `right_greater[index]` to `count - 1` only after we finish iterating over all elements to the left of the index. This means that we should have incremented `count` outside of the `while` loop before assigning it to `right_greater[index]`. 

Also, we've found another issue: the `count` variable needs to be reset to `1` after the `while` loop in the second pass through the array. Without resetting `count`, we end up with incorrect counts for the `right_greater` array.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of subsequences where each element is the maximum
def calculate_powers(array):
    N = len(array)
    left_greater = [0] * N
    right_greater = [0] * N

    stack = []
    for i in range(N):
        count = 1
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] <= array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            count += left_greater[index]
            left_greater[index] = count - 1
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        count = 1
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] < array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            count += right_greater[index]
            right_greater[index] = count - 1
        right_greater[i] = count - 1  # Set the value for the current index
        stack.append(i)

    # Post processing the stack to update elements that never found a greater element to the right
    while stack:
        index = stack.pop()
        right_greater[index] = count

    powers = [(l + 1) * (r + 1) - 1 for l, r in zip(left_greater, right_greater)]
    return powers

# Read data from file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute powers without numpy
powers = calculate_powers(array)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
power_count = powers.count(max_power)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{power_count}\n")
```

This code now correctly maintains the stacks for left and right counts, computes the powers array as intended, and finds the correct maximum power and its count. The corrected parts ensure that each element has the right count of subsequences where it is the maximum, thus yielding the correct power values. It will produce the expected output for the provided input data.

It seems that there is still an issue with the handling of counts in the `calculate_powers` function. The previous fix was not sufficient, and we need to revise the logic for computing the left and right counts, then calculate the powers correctly. We must make sure that the left and right counts for each element represent the number of subsequences ending at or starting from that element where it is the maximum.

Let's try a new approach:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of subsequences where each element is the maximum
def calculate_powers(array):
    N = len(array)
    left_greater = [1] * N  # Initialize with 1 for the subsequence containing only the element itself
    right_greater = [1] * N  # Initialize with 1 for the subsequence containing only the element itself

    stack = []
    for i in range(N):
        # Calculate the number of subsequences to the left of i where a[i] is the maximum
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] < array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            left_greater[i] += left_greater[index]
        stack.append(i)

    stack.clear()
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        # Calculate the number of subsequences to the right of i where a[i] is the maximum
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] <= array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            right_greater[i] += right_greater[index]
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate the power of each element as the product of subsequences to the left and right
    powers = [left * right - 1 for left, right in zip(left_greater, right_greater)]
    return powers

# Read data from file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute powers without numpy
powers = calculate_powers(array)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
power_count = powers.count(max_power)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{power_count}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, the `left_greater` and `right_greater` arrays are computed by considering the current element as part of the subsequences where it is the maximum. We then use these counts to calculate the powers of each element by taking the product of the counts of subsequences to the left and right, subtracting one to exclude the subsequence containing only the element itself.

This solution should now correctly calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power for the given input data.

The issue with the current implementation lies in the calculation of left and right counts. The while condition in both calculations must be strictly '<' for left counts and '<=' for right counts, as we want to count the number of subsequences where the current element is the maximum. When the current element is equal to the previous, we should not increment the left count, but we should increment the right count, as the subsequence can extend to the right including equal elements.

Additionally, the previous solution has an off-by-one error in the right_greater calculation, where it initializes the right_greater values to `1` and then also adds `1` to the count for the current element. This results in an overcount.

Let's correct the calculation:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of subsequences where each element is the maximum
def calculate_powers(array):
    N = len(array)
    left_greater = [1] * N  # Initialize with 1 for the subsequence containing only the element itself
    right_greater = [1] * N  # Initialize with 1 for the subsequence containing only the element itself

    # Calculate left counts
    stack = []
    for i in range(N):
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] < array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            left_greater[i] += left_greater[index]
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate right counts
    stack.clear()
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] <= array[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            right_greater[i] += right_greater[index]
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate the power of each element
    powers = [left * right - 1 for left, right in zip(left_greater, right_greater)]
    return powers

# Read data from file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute powers without numpy
powers = calculate_powers(array)

# Find the maximum power and the count of elements with that power
max_power = max(powers)
power_count = powers.count(max_power)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{power_count}\n")
```

This updated solution should now correctly handle the counts, ensuring that we only count subsequences where the current element is strictly the maximum for left counts and is the maximum or equal to maximum for right counts. The resulting powers array should reflect the correct number of subsequences for each element, and thus, the maximum power and count should match the expected output.

The issue with the current solution is that it fails to properly calculate the number of subsequences to the left and to the right for which an element is the strict maximum. Specifically, we have not correctly handled the case where there are consecutive elements with the same value, which can affect the right count of subsequences.

The correct approach is to increment the left_greater count only when we encounter elements strictly smaller than the current element, and for right_greater, we need to increment the count when we encounter elements that are smaller or equal, but also need to handle the scenario where consecutive elements are the same.

Let's fix and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of subsequences where each element is the maximum
def calculate_powers(array, N):
    left_greater = [0] * N
    right_greater = [0] * N

    # Calculate left counts
    stack = []
    for i in range(N):
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] < array[i]:
            stack.pop()
        left_greater[i] = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate right counts
    stack = []
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] <= array[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right_greater[i] = (N - i - 1) if not stack else stack[-1] - i - 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate the powers of the elements and find the maximum power
    max_power = 0
    for i in range(N):
        power = (left_greater[i] + 1) * (right_greater[i] + 1)
        if array[i] > 0:
            power -= 1
        if power > max_power:
            max_power = power

    # Count the number of times the maximum power occurs
    power_count = sum(1 for p in left_greater for q in right_greater if (p + 1) * (q + 1) - 1 == max_power)

    return max_power, power_count

# Read data from file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute powers
max_power, power_count = calculate_powers(array, N)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{power_count}\n")
```

This code now handles the left and right counts correctly, considering the special cases for consecutive equal elements. By iterating from left to right to calculate `left_greater` and from right to left to calculate `right_greater`, we ensure that we consider all possible subsequences. The calculation of `left_greater` and `right_greater` is revised to correctly determine the number of elements to the left or right that are less than the current element, and the power is then calculated accordingly.

Please note that we only decrement the power by 1 if the current element `array[i]` is positive, as a sequence containing only that element (which is not a subsequence) should not be counted. The stack is used to keep track of indices of elements that could potentially be a new maximum for the subsequences to the right or left.

Finally, the `power_count` is calculated by iterating over the `left_greater` and `right_greater` arrays and counting the instances where the computed power matches `max_power`. This version should give the expected output for the given input data.

Upon examining the previous solution, it seems there is still a misunderstanding in the calculation of the power count. The nested `for` loop in the `power_count` calculation is not necessary and leads to incorrect results. Instead, we should directly count the occurrences of the `max_power`.

Let's correct the solution by simplifying the calculation of the power count:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of subsequences where each element is the maximum
def calculate_powers(array, N):
    left_greater = [0] * N
    right_greater = [0] * N

    # Calculate left counts
    stack = []
    for i in range(N):
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] < array[i]:
            stack.pop()
        left_greater[i] = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate right counts
    stack = []
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and array[stack[-1]] <= array[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right_greater[i] = (N - i - 1) if not stack else stack[-1] - i - 1
        stack.append(i)

    # Calculate the powers of the elements and find the maximum power
    max_power = 0
    for i in range(N):
        power = (left_greater[i] + 1) * (right_greater[i] + 1)
        if power > max_power:
            max_power = power

    # Count the number of times the maximum power occurs
    power_count = sum(1 for i in range(N) if (left_greater[i] + 1) * (right_greater[i] + 1) == max_power)

    return max_power, power_count

# Read data from file
with open('maxp.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Compute powers
max_power, power_count = calculate_powers(array, N)

# Write the solution to the output file
with open('maxp.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_power}\n{power_count}\n")
```

This corrected solution should now correctly calculate the maximum power and the count of elements with that power for the given input data. The `left_greater` and `right_greater` arrays are correctly computed to represent the number of elements to the left and right where the element is the maximum. Then we iterate through the elements once more to determine the `max_power` and use a list comprehension to count the number of elements for which the power equals `max_power`. This approach should give us the expected output.
