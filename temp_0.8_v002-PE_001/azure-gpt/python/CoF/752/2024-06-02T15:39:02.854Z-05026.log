Ionel a primit temă de la profesorul său: să scrie pe hârtie numerele de la 1 la n. Cum numărul n era destul de mare el s-a cam plictisit şi a început să se joace numărând de câte ori a apărut o anumită cifră în numerele ce trebuiau scrise. Cum număratul era o activitate destul de lentă, el a găsit o metodă simplă de a calcula de câte ori a apărut o cifră în toate numerele tipărite.

# Cerință

Scrieţi un program care, citind numărul n şi o cifră nenulă c, afişează numărul de apariţii ale cifrei c în reprezentarea tuturor numerelor de la 1 la n.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului de intrare `cifre.in` se găsesc două numere întregi, $n$ și $c$.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierului de ieșire `cifre.out` se va găsi un singur număr întreg, numărul de apariţii al cifrei $c$ în reprezentarea tuturor numerelor de la $1$ la $n$.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^9$;
* $1 \leq c \leq 9$;

Example:
`cifre.in`
```
15 1
```

`cifre.out`
```
8
```

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```markdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Function to count occurrences of the digit c from 1 to n
def count_digit_occurrences(n, c):
    count = 0
    factor = 1
    while factor <= n:
        higher = n // (factor * 10)
        current = (n // factor) % 10
        lower = n - (n // factor) * factor

        if current > c:
            count += (higher + 1) * factor
        elif current == c:
            count += higher * factor + lower + 1
        else:
            count += higher * factor

        factor *= 10

    return count

# Read input from cifre.in
with open('cifre.in', 'r') as file:
    n, c = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of occurrences
occurrences = count_digit_occurrences(n, c)

# Write the result to cifre.out
with open('cifre.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(occurrences))
```
```

This Python code snippet will read the inputs from `cifre.in`, process the data using a custom function `count_digit_occurrences` that counts the appearance of a specified digit in all numbers from 1 to n, and then write the result to `cifre.out`. The logic of counting digit occurrences is optimized to avoid iterating through each number individually, which would be computationally expensive for larger values of n.

The function `count_digit_occurrences` uses a mathematical approach to count the occurrences of the digit by analyzing each digit's position in the sequence from 1 to n, which is significantly more efficient than brute-force string conversion and counting. It handles each position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) separately and calculates the occurrences based on the higher and lower parts of the number, relative to the current position being analyzed.

This solution should meet the memory limit requirements as it does not store large data structures or arrays in memory. The use of NumPy, as mentioned in the challenge, is not necessary here, as the optimization does not involve array operations that would benefit from NumPy's efficiency.

This is a revised solution that reads from `cifre.in` and writes to `cifre.out`, as required by the problem statement, and does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations. The function `count_digit_occurrences` efficiently calculates the number of times a given digit appears in all numbers from 1 to n.

Certainly, here's the corrected solution, applying the necessary fixes and ensuring that the program reads from `cifre.in` and writes the result to `cifre.out` without using `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations:

```python
# Function to count occurrences of the digit c from 1 to n
def count_digit_occurrences(n, c):
    count = 0
    factor = 1
    while factor <= n:
        higher = n // (factor * 10)
        current = (n // factor) % 10
        lower = n - (n // factor) * factor
        
        if current > c:
            count += (higher + 1) * factor
        elif current == c:
            count += higher * factor + lower + 1
        else:
            count += higher * factor
        
        factor *= 10
    
    return count

# Read input from cifre.in
with open('cifre.in', 'r') as file:
    n, c = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of occurrences
occurrences = count_digit_occurrences(n, c)

# Write the result to cifre.out
with open('cifre.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(occurrences))
```

This code is expected to fulfill the challenge requirements, efficiently calculating the occurrences of the digit `c` in all numbers from `1` to `n` and writing the output to the specified file while adhering to the memory constraints.
