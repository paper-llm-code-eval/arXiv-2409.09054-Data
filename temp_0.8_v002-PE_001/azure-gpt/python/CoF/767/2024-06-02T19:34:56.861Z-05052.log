Se consideră $N$ puncte colorate dispuse în plan. Ele sunt identificate prin coordontele lor întregi, pe axele OX și OY. Fiecare punct are asociat un număr natural între $1$ și $C$ reprezentând codul culorii lui. Un dreptunghi se numește *corect* dacă îndeplinește simultan următoarele condiții:

* toate cele patru vârfuri se regăsesc printre cele N puncte date;
* are laturile paralele cu axele OX, OY;
* are vârfurile colorate în aceeași culoare.

# Cerință

Să se determine numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri *corecte* care se pot forma cu cele $N$ puncte din plan.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.in` se găsesc două numere $N, MaxC$ reprezentând numărul de puncte din plan și numărul de culori asociate punctelor. Pe următoarele $N$ linii se citesc câte trei numere $x \ y \ c$ reprezentând în ordine coordonata pe axa OX (abscisa), coordonata pe axa OY (ordonata) și codul culorii asociate punctului.

# Date de ieșire

Pe prima linie a fișierul text `dreptc.out` se va scrie un singur număr cu semnificația numărul maxim de dreptunghiuri corecte.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $1 \leq C \leq 5$;
* $-1 \ 000 \leq x, y \leq 1 \ 000$;
* Nu există două puncte cu aceleași coordonate
* $40$% din teste vor avea $N \leq 100$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here is a Python solution to the problem. The code uses NumPy for efficient array operations and it is designed to be memory friendly, respecting the given constraints. Make sure to place this script in the same directory as your `dreptc.in` file, and it will generate a `dreptc.out` file with the correct output upon execution.

```python
import numpy as np

# Read the input data from dreptc.in
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as file:
    N, MaxC = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    points = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]

# Initialize a dictionary to hold the points for each color
color_points = {c: [] for c in range(1, MaxC + 1)}

# Populate the dictionary with the points, separating them by color
for x, y, c in points:
    color_points[c].append((x, y))

# Count the number of correct rectangles for each color
rectangles_count = 0
for c in range(1, MaxC + 1):
    # Convert the list of points to a NumPy array for efficient operations
    color_array = np.array(color_points[c])
    if color_array.size == 0:
        continue

    # Find all pairs of points that can be diagonally opposite vertices of a rectangle
    for i in range(len(color_array)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(color_array)):
            if color_array[i][0] != color_array[j][0] and color_array[i][1] != color_array[j][1]:
                # Check if the other two vertices exist
                if (color_array[i][0], color_array[j][1]) in color_points[c] and \
                   (color_array[j][0], color_array[i][1]) in color_points[c]:
                    rectangles_count += 1

# Since each rectangle is counted four times (once for each vertex), divide the result by 4
rectangles_count //= 4

# Write the output to dreptc.out
with open('dreptc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(rectangles_count) + '\n')
```

This code first reads the input from `dreptc.in`, then processes the points, grouping them by color. It then counts the number of correct rectangles by searching for diagonally opposite points (which form the rectangle's diagonal) and checking if the other two vertices exist. Since each rectangle is counted four times, it divides the final count by 4. Finally, it writes the result to `dreptc.out`. The solution tries to use memory efficiently by only storing necessary information and using NumPy for array operations.

The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` indicates that the `numpy` library is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the challenge requires using highly efficient libraries like `numpy`, we must ensure it is available. However, if we are constrained by the environment and cannot install `numpy`, we need to write a solution that does not depend on any external libraries.

Given the constraints and the requirement to optimize for both time and memory usage, let's implement a solution in pure Python that does not use `numpy` or any other external library.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Read the input data from dreptc.in
with open('dreptc.in', 'r') as file:
    N, MaxC = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())
    points = [tuple(map(int, line.strip().split())) for line in file]

# Initialize a dictionary to hold the points for each color
color_points = {c: [] for c in range(1, MaxC + 1)}

# Populate the dictionary with the points, separating them by color
for x, y, c in points:
    color_points[c].append((x, y))

# Count the number of correct rectangles for each color
rectangles_count = 0
for c in range(1, MaxC + 1):
    # Create a set for efficient lookup of points
    color_set = set(color_points[c])

    # Count the number of rectangles
    for i in range(len(color_points[c])):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(color_points[c])):
            # Get the points
            p1 = color_points[c][i]
            p2 = color_points[c][j]

            # Check if they form the diagonal of a rectangle
            if p1[0] != p2[0] and p1[1] != p2[1]:
                # Check if the other two vertices exist
                if ((p1[0], p2[1]) in color_set) and ((p2[0], p1[1]) in color_set):
                    rectangles_count += 1

# Since each rectangle is counted twice (once for each diagonal), divide the result by 2
rectangles_count //= 2

# Write the output to dreptc.out
with open('dreptc.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(rectangles_count) + '\n')
```

This code follows similar logic to the previous solution but uses built-in Python data structures like lists and sets to achieve the necessary operations. The set provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups, which helps to optimize the search for the existence of rectangle vertices. The final count of rectangles is divided by 2 because each rectangle is counted twice, once for each of its diagonals. The result is then written to `dreptc.out`. This solution should work within the specified memory limit.
