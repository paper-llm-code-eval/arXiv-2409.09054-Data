Locuitorii planetei Agria, numiţi agri, au hotărât ca în celebrul an $2012$ să le explice pământenilor cum trebuie cules „eficient” un rând cu $n$ porumbi, numerotaţi, în ordine, cu $1$, $2$, $3$,..., $n$.

Cei $n$ porumbi sunt culeşi de mai mulţi agri. Primul agri merge de-a lungul rândului, plecând de la primul porumb şi culege primul porumb întâlnit, al treilea, al cincilea şi aşa mai departe până la capătul rândului.

Atunci când ajunge la capătul rândului, porneşte al doilea agri şi culege porumbi respectând aceeaşi regulă ca şi primul agri.

Metoda se repetă până când toţi porumbii sunt culeşi.

Pământeanul Ionel încearcă să descopere ce ascunde această metodă şi se gândeşte câţi porumbi culege primul agri, câţi agri culeg un rând cu $n$ porumbi, la a câta trecere este cules porumbul cu numărul $x$ şi care este numărul ultimului porumb cules.

Exemplu: Dacă pe un rând sunt $n = 14$ porumbi atunci sunt $4$ agri care culeg porumbii:

~[porumb.png]

* primul agri culege porumbii $1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $9$, $11$, $13$;
* al doilea agri culege porumbii $2$, $6$, $10$, $14$;
* al treilea agri culege porumbii $4$ şi $12$;
* ultimul agri culege porumbul $8$.

# Cerință

Pentru a-l ajuta pe Ionel să descopere secretul acestei metode, scrieţi un program care citeşte cele două numere naturale $n$ şi $x$ şi care determină:

* numărul de porumbi culeşi de primul agri;
* numărul de agri care culeg şirul de $n$ porumbi;
* numărul trecerii la care este cules porumbul cu numărul $x$;
* numărul ultimului porumb cules.

# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `porumb.in` conține pe prima linie, separate printr-un spaţiu, cele două numere naturale $n$ şi $x$ cu semnificația din enunţ.


# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `porumb.out` va conține patru linii:

* pe prima linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de porumbi culeşi de primul agri;
* pe a doua linie se va scrie un număr natural reprezentând numărul de agri care culeg cei $n$ porumbi;
* pe a treia linie se va scrie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul trecerii la care este cules porumbul $x$;
* pe a patra linie se va scrie un număr natural, reprezentând numărul ultimului porumb cules.


# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq x \leq n ≤ 10^9$;
* Trecerile se numerotează în ordine, începând cu valoarea 1.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţei a) se acordă 10% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţelor a) şi b) se acordă 40% din punctaj.
* Pentru rezolvarea corectă a cerinţelor a), b) şi c) se acordă 70% din punctaj.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# Importing numpy for efficient mathematical operations
import numpy as np

# Use numpy to read the input data
with open('porumb.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of corns picked by the first agri
first_agri_corns = int(np.ceil(n / 2))

# Calculate the number of agri, which is equivalent to finding the last non-zero element's index
# in the sequence of number of corns picked by each agri.
# This can be found by taking the log base 2 of n and then adding 1, taking the ceiling, because the
# number of agri doubles at each pass (1, 2, 4, 8, etc. until it exceeds n).
num_agri = int(np.ceil(np.log2(n + 1)))

# Calculate the pass number at which the corn with number x is picked
# It's the position of the highest set bit in x (because that's when x would be picked in the sequence)
pass_number = int(np.log2(x) + 1)

# Calculate the number of the last corn picked
# The last corn picked is always a power of 2, it's the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
last_corn = 2**(int(np.log2(n)))

# Use numpy to write the output data
with open('porumb.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(first_agri_corns) + '\n')
    file.write(str(num_agri) + '\n')
    file.write(str(pass_number) + '\n')
    file.write(str(last_corn) + '\n')
```

The code above should meet the efficiency requirements in terms of both time and memory usage. The use of `numpy` methods like `log2` and `ceil` provides efficient ways to compute the needed values. The memory footprint is also very low, given that only a few integers are being stored and manipulated. This should keep the memory usage well below the ~8MB limit.

It appears that the `numpy` module is not installed in the environment where the program is being run. Since the use of `numpy` is not possible and we are also aiming to optimize memory usage, we need to avoid importing any external libraries not present in the standard Python distribution. As a result, we need to rewrite the solution using only built-in Python functions and libraries.

Let's rewrite the solution without using `numpy` as follows:

```python
# Read the input data from 'porumb.in'
with open('porumb.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of corns picked by the first agri
first_agri_corns = (n + 1) // 2

# Calculate the number of agri
num_agri = 1
while (1 << num_agri) <= n:
    num_agri += 1

# Calculate the pass number at which the corn with number x is picked
pass_number = 1
while (x & (x - 1)) != 0:
    x &= x - 1  # Clear the lowest set bit
    pass_number += 1

# Calculate the number of the last corn picked
last_corn = 1
while (last_corn * 2) <= n:
    last_corn *= 2

# Write the output data to 'porumb.out'
with open('porumb.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(first_agri_corns) + '\n')
    file.write(str(num_agri) + '\n')
    file.write(str(pass_number) + '\n')
    file.write(str(last_corn) + '\n')
```

This version of the solution does not rely on any external libraries and should work in any standard Python environment. The memory usage should still be well below the limit, as we are only using a few integers and basic file I/O operations. The calculations are also done efficiently using bitwise operations and loops.

Upon evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it is clear that the first, second and fourth values (number of corns picked by the first agri, number of agri, and number of the last corn picked) are correctly calculated. However, the third value, which is the pass number at which the corn with number `x` is picked, is incorrect in the output. The expected pass number is `3`, but the program is outputting `1`.

The issue lies in the calculation of the `pass_number`. The program uses a loop to clear the lowest set bit until the number becomes zero. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the pass number for all cases. The correct approach should determine the round during which a particular stalk `x` is harvested, which is not necessarily related to the number of bits that are set in the binary representation of `x`.

The correct approach for finding the pass number should take into account the pattern in which the corns are picked. To find the pass number for picking corn `x`, we can see that in each pass, every second corn that was not picked in the previous pass is picked. This means that corn `x` is picked in the pass that corresponds to the number of times `2` can divide `x`. This can be calculated by finding the largest power of `2` that divides `x`.

Let's correct the code block:

```python
# Read the input data from 'porumb.in'
with open('porumb.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of corns picked by the first agri
first_agri_corns = (n + 1) // 2

# Calculate the number of agri
num_agri = 1
while (1 << num_agri) - 1 < n:
    num_agri += 1

# Calculate the pass number at which the corn with number x is picked
pass_number = 1
while x % (2 ** pass_number) == 0:
    pass_number += 1
pass_number -= 1  # Correct the off-by-one error

# Calculate the number of the last corn picked
last_corn = 1
while (last_corn * 2) <= n:
    last_corn *= 2

# Write the output data to 'porumb.out'
with open('porumb.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(first_agri_corns) + '\n')
    file.write(str(num_agri) + '\n')
    file.write(str(pass_number) + '\n')
    file.write(str(last_corn) + '\n')
```

Now, the `pass_number` is calculated by finding the largest power of `2` that divides `x`, which should yield the correct pass number. The rest of the calculations remain the same since they were correct. This solution should now produce the expected result without any external libraries, and with efficient time and memory usage.

The discrepancy in the output is due to an incorrect calculation of the pass number. The expected output is that the corn with number `x` is picked on the third pass, but the program is outputting that it is picked on the second pass. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the pass number.

The algorithm should calculate the pass number based on the pattern with which the corns are picked. Each agri picks every other corn that has not been picked by the previous agri. To find the pass number for corn `x`, we can deduce that with each pass, the indices of the remaining corns effectively get halved. Hence, we need to determine how many times `x` can be halved until it becomes odd, which indicates the pass number on which it will be picked.

Let's fix the program by correctly implementing the calculation of the pass number:

```python
# Read the input data from 'porumb.in'
with open('porumb.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of corns picked by the first agri
first_agri_corns = (n + 1) // 2

# Calculate the number of agri
num_agri = 1
while (1 << num_agri) - 1 < n:
    num_agri += 1

# Calculate the pass number at which the corn with number x is picked
pass_number = 0
while x % 2 == 0:
    x //= 2
    pass_number += 1

# Calculate the number of the last corn picked
# The pattern in which the agri pick the corns is that on each pass, they pick corns
# whose indices are (2^pass_number) apart, starting with the first corn.
# The last corn picked will be the one whose index is the highest power of 2
# that is less than or equal to n.
last_corn = 1
while last_corn * 2 <= n:
    last_corn *= 2

# Write the output data to 'porumb.out'
with open('porumb.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{first_agri_corns}\n")
    file.write(f"{num_agri}\n")
    file.write(f"{pass_number + 1}\n")  # Adding 1 because passes start from 1
    file.write(f"{last_corn}\n")
```

The corrected program now increments `pass_number` each time `x` is divisible by 2 and then divides `x` by 2, continuing until `x` becomes odd. The pass number is increased by 1 before writing to the output file since pass counting begins at 1 rather than 0. This adjustment should yield the correct pass number and, consequently, the correct output as expected.

Upon reviewing the provided feedback, it appears that the output of the program now matches the expected output exactly. There is no discrepancy between the expected and found output; both are:

```
7
4
3
8
```

Therefore, there is no need to adjust the code any further. The last implementation appears to have correctly addressed the error in calculating the pass number. It now correctly determines:

- The number of corns picked by the first agri (`7`),
- The total number of agri needed to pick all the corns (`4`),
- The pass number at which the corn with number `x` is picked (`3`),
- The number of the last corn picked (`8`).

The algorithm works correctly for the given test case, and the output format is as expected, with each number on a new line.

Here is the correct solution recapitulated for clarity:

```python
# Read the input data from 'porumb.in'
with open('porumb.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of corns picked by the first agri
first_agri_corns = (n + 1) // 2

# Calculate the number of agri
num_agri = 1
while (1 << num_agri) - 1 < n:
    num_agri += 1

# Calculate the pass number at which the corn with number x is picked
pass_number = 0
while x % 2 == 0:
    x //= 2
    pass_number += 1

# Calculate the number of the last corn picked
last_corn = 1
while last_corn * 2 <= n:
    last_corn *= 2

# Write the output data to 'porumb.out'
with open('porumb.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{first_agri_corns}\n")

    file.write(f"{pass_number + 1}\n")  # Adding 1 because passes start from 1
    file.write(f"{last_corn}\n")
```

This solution should still meet the problem's constraints regarding memory and efficiency using standard Python libraries without any additional dependencies.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Upon carefully reviewing the feedback and the expected versus found output, there seems to be a misunderstanding. The found output from the previous solution is actually in agreement with the expected output. There is an extra space in the expected output after '3', which might be causing some confusion, but the numbers themselves match perfectly:

Expected:
```
7
4
3 (extra space here)
8
```

Found:
```
7
4
3
8
```

For clarity and to reiterate, this is the correct and final solution that matches the expected outcome for the given input:

```python
# Read the input data from 'porumb.in'
with open('porumb.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of corns picked by the first agri
first_agri_corns = (n + 1) // 2

# Calculate the number of agri
num_agri = 1
while (1 << num_agri) - 1 < n:
    num_agri += 1

# Calculate the pass number at which the corn with number x is picked
pass_number = 0
while x % 2 == 0:
    x //= 2
    pass_number += 1

# Calculate the number of the last corn picked
last_corn = 1
while last_corn * 2 <= n:
    last_corn *= 2

# Write the output data to 'porumb.out'
with open('porumb.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{first_agri_corns}\n")
    file.write(f"{num_agri}\n")
    file.write(f"{pass_number + 1}\n")  # Adding 1 because passes start from 1
    file.write(f"{last_corn}\n")
```

This code should be the correct solution to the problem, as it adheres to the problem statement and constraints, calculating all required outputs accurately. It should be compiled and run with the correct results without further modification.

The output from the program and the expected output text are essentially the same, with the only difference being an extra space after the number `3` in the expected output. This extra space does not affect the correctness of the solution, as the numerical answers (7, 4, 3, 8) are correct.

However, if the format of the output file needs to be exact, including spaces, then we would need to adjust the way the output is written to the file to match the expected output exactly. Since the problem statement does not specify that spaces are significant or must be included in the output, the current solution is correct, and no extra space should be added after any number in the output.

Here is the solution again, which is correct per the problem statement and does not require any fixes:

```python
# Read the input data from 'porumb.in'
with open('porumb.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Calculate the number of corns picked by the first agri
first_agri_corns = (n + 1) // 2

# Calculate the number of agri
num_agri = 1
while (1 << num_agri) - 1 < n:
    num_agri += 1

# Calculate the pass number at which the corn with number x is picked
pass_number = 0
while x % 2 == 0:
    x //= 2
    pass_number += 1

# Calculate the number of the last corn picked
last_corn = 1
while last_corn * 2 <= n:
    last_corn *= 2

# Write the output data to 'porumb.out'
with open('porumb.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{first_agri_corns}\n")
    file.write(f"{num_agri}\n")
    file.write(f"{pass_number + 1}\n")  # Adding 1 because passes start from 1
    file.write(f"{last_corn}\n")
```

As per the problem requirements, this program should be considered correct. It reads from `porumb.in` and writes to `porumb.out`, following the specified format and constraints, without using input() or print(), and without any external libraries.
