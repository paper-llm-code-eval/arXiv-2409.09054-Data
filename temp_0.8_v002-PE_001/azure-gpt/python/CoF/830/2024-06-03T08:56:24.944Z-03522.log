O **clepsidră** este un dispozitiv folosit pentru a măsura timpul. Clepsidra este alcatuită din două incinte de sticlă, conectate printr-un tub fin. Una dintre incinte este umplută cu nisip, acesta scurgându-se în cea de-a doua incintă, cu o viteză constantă. Clepsidra poate fi întoarsă, pentru a măsura o altă perioadă de timp.
Arheologii au descoperit un dispozitiv, pe care l-au denumit **clepsidru**, format din $n$ clepsidre identice, suprapuse, numerotate de la $1$ la $n$, prin care nisipul poate circula de la o clepsidră la alta datorită forței gravitaționale.
Studiind acest obiect, arheologii au constatat că:
* dispozitivul poate fi utilizat atât în pozitia $1$, când clepsidrele sunt în ordinea $1, 2,\dots, n$ cu clepsidra $n$ așezată pe sol, cât și în poziția $2$, cand clepsidrele sunt în ordinea $n, n-1, \dots, 1$ cu clepsidra $1$ așezată pe sol;
* viteza de trecere a nisipului de la o incintă la alta, a aceleiași clepsidre, este de **$1$ bob de nisip/secunda**, pentru toate clepsidrele, indiferent de poziție;
* trecerea clepsidrului dintr-o poziție în alta presupune răsturnarea acestuia și reașezarea boabelor de nisip;
* timpul de trecere a boabelor de nisip de la o clepsidră la alta este $0$.

Arheologii studiază comportarea clepsidrului realizând două experimente diferite, dupa cum urmează:

1. Se așează clepsidrul în poziția $1$, se introduc în incinta de sus a clepsidrei $1$ un numar $b$ de boabe de nisip și se determină dupa câte secunde vor ajunge toate boabele de nisip in incinta de jos a ultimei clepsidre;
2. Se așează clepsidrul în poziția $1$, se introduc în incinta de sus a clepsidrei $1$ un numar $b$ de boabe de nisip, apoi se așează clepsidrul în **$k$ stari** consecutive, o stare fiind caracterizată de valorile $S_i$ și $P_i$, ce reprezintă numărul de secunde, respectiv poziția, în care este menținut nemișcat clepsidrul, iar la final se determină numărul de boabe de nisip din incintele fiecărei clepsidre.

Spre exemplu, dacă clepsidrul este format din $n=2$ clepsidre, iar în incinta de sus a primei clepsidre se introduc $b=3$ boabe de nisip, la primul experiment se va obține valoarea $4$. La al doilea experiment se așează clepsidrul în $k=2$ stări, caracterizate prin $S_1=3, P_1=1$; $S_2=1, P_2=2$. Numărul de boabe de nisip din clepsidre va evolua ca în figura ce urmează:

# Cerință

The error message indicates that the numpy module is not installed in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the original challenge mentioned optimizing for both time and memory and suggested using numpy and other highly efficient libraries, it's likely that the execution environment in this particular challenge does not support external libraries like numpy.

To fix the program, I'll rewrite it without using numpy, and instead use standard Python lists, which should be sufficient for the given constraints.

Here's the updated solution:

```python
# Function to simulate the first experiment
def first_experiment(n, b):
    # The time taken is simply the sum of all intervals which is (1+2+3+...+n) + (n-1)
    return int(n*(n+1)/2 + (n-1))

# Function to simulate the second experiment
def second_experiment(n, b, k, states):
    # Creating lists for upper and lower compartments, initially filled with zeros
    upper = [0] * n
    lower = [0] * n
    
    # Initially, fill the upper compartment of the first hourglass with b sand grains
    upper[0] = b

    for seconds, position in states:
        for _ in range(seconds):
            # Transfer sand grains for each second
            for j in range(n):
                if upper[j] > 0:
                    transfer = min(1, upper[j])
                    upper[j] -= transfer
                    lower[j] += transfer

                    # If position is 1, transfer to next hourglass; if 2, to previous
                    if position == 1 and j < n - 1:
                        lower[j] -= transfer
                        upper[j + 1] += transfer
                    elif position == 2 and j > 0:
                        upper[j] -= transfer
                        lower[j - 1] += transfer

    # For the remaining grains, iterate until all the grains reach the bottom
    for j in range(n-1):
        while upper[j] > 0:
            transfer = min(1, upper[j])
            upper[j] -= transfer
            lower[j] += transfer
            upper[j + 1] += transfer
    # Transfer the remaining grains in the last hourglass
    lower[n-1] += upper[n-1]
    upper[n-1] = 0

    # Return the final state of hourglasses
    return list(zip(upper, lower))

# Reading input data
with open('clepsidru.in', 'r') as file:
    n, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    states = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Calculate the results for the two experiments
exp1_result = first_experiment(n, b)
exp2_result = second_experiment(n, b, k, states)

# Writing output data
with open('clepsidru.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{exp1_result}\n')
    for upper, lower in exp2_result:
        file.write(f'{upper} {lower}\n')
```

This solution uses basic Python data structures and should not exceed the memory limit for the problem constraints, while still providing the correct output.

The results differ because the simulation of sand transfer in the second experiment is not correctly handling the transfer of sand between the hourglasses. In particular, the code does not properly simulate the transfer of sand when the clepsydra is in position 2 (inverted). The transfer logic needs to be rethought to ensure that the sand is correctly transferred to the adjacent hourglass, depending on the current position.

A careful review of the logic reveals that I made a mistake in transferring the sand between the upper and lower compartments of the hourglasses. In position 2, the sand should be transferred from the lower compartment of one hourglass to the upper compartment of the next one. Moreover, the transfer should be done in reverse order (from n to 1) when the clepsydra is inverted.

I will now rewrite the solution to fix the bug and ensure the sand is correctly transferred according to the experiment's rules:

```python
# Function to simulate the first experiment
def first_experiment(n, b):
    # The time taken is simply n seconds for each hourglass plus the initial b seconds
    return n + b - 1

# Function to simulate the second experiment
def second_experiment(n, b, k, states):
    # Lists for upper and lower compartments
    upper = [0] * n
    lower = [0] * n
    # Initially, fill the upper compartment of the first hourglass with b sand grains
    upper[0] = b

    # Process each state
    for seconds, position in states:
        while seconds > 0:
            # Transfer sand grain by grain
            if position == 1:
                # Position 1: normal order
                for j in range(n):
                    if upper[j] > 0:
                        # Transfer a grain from upper to lower
                        upper[j] -= 1
                        lower[j] += 1
                        if j < n - 1:
                            # Transfer a grain to the next hourglass
                            lower[j] -= 1
                            upper[j + 1] += 1
            else:
                # Position 2: inverted order
                for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                    if lower[j] > 0:
                        # Transfer a grain from lower to upper
                        lower[j] -= 1
                        upper[j] += 1
                        if j > 0:
                            # Transfer a grain to the 'previous' hourglass
                            upper[j] -= 1
                            lower[j - 1] += 1
            seconds -= 1
    
    # Final state after all states have been processed
    final_state = [(upper[i], lower[i]) for i in range(n)]
    return final_state

# Reading input data
with open('clepsidru.in', 'r') as file:
    n, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    states = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Calculate the results for the two experiments
exp1_result = first_experiment(n, b)
exp2_result = second_experiment(n, b, k, states)

# Writing output data

    file.write(f'{exp1_result}\n')
    for upper, lower in exp2_result:
        file.write(f'{upper} {lower}\n')
```

This updated solution corrects the sand transfer logic to conform to the rules described in the problem statement. It adjusts the grain transfers according to the current position of the clepsydra and processes the states as sequences of grain transfers.

The results differ again because the logic to handle the inversion of the clepsydra is not correctly implemented. When the clepsydra is inverted (position 2), the sand should transfer from the lower compartment of one hourglass to the upper compartment of the previous hourglass, not the next one. Furthermore, the transfer process needs to be careful with the ordering of the updates to the hourglasses so that sand doesn't incorrectly "jump" over hourglasses. 

Let's fix the implementation of the second experiment to properly handle the inversion of the clepsydra.

```python
# Function to simulate the first experiment
def first_experiment(n, b):
    # The time taken is simply n seconds for each hourglass plus the initial b seconds
    return (n - 1) + b

# Function to simulate the second experiment
def second_experiment(n, b, k, states):
    # Lists for upper and lower compartments, initially filled with b at the top of the first
    upper = [0] * n
    lower = [0] * n
    upper[0] = b  # fill the first upper compartment with b sand grains

    # Process each state
    for seconds, position in states:
        for _ in range(seconds):
            if position == 1:  # If position is 1, the grains fall down normally
                for j in reversed(range(n)):  # Start from the bottom
                    if j > 0 and upper[j - 1] > 0:  # Transfer from the upper hourglass to the current
                        transfer_amount = min(1, upper[j - 1])
                        upper[j] += transfer_amount
                        upper[j - 1] -= transfer_amount
                    # Move sand from upper to lower in the current hourglass
                    transfer_amount = min(1, upper[j])
                    upper[j] -= transfer_amount
                    lower[j] += transfer_amount
            else:  # If position is 2, the grains fall up, reversing the direction
                for j in range(n):
                    if j < n - 1 and lower[j + 1] > 0:  # Transfer from lower hourglass to the current
                        transfer_amount = min(1, lower[j + 1])
                        upper[j] += transfer_amount
                        lower[j + 1] -= transfer_amount
                    # Move sand from upper to lower in the current hourglass
                    transfer_amount = min(1, upper[j])
                    upper[j] -= transfer_amount
                    lower[j] += transfer_amount

    # Return the final state of upper and lower compartments for each hourglass
    return list(zip(upper, lower))

# Reading input data
with open('clepsidru.in', 'r') as file:
    n, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    states = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Calculate the results for the two experiments
exp1_result = first_experiment(n, b)
exp2_result = second_experiment(n, b, k, states)

    file.write(f'{exp1_result}\n')
    for upper, lower in exp2_result:
        file.write(f'{upper} {lower}\n')
```

This updated solution corrects the inversion logic by considering the position of the clepsydra. It handles the sand transfer correctly when the clepsydra is in normal and inverted positions, ensuring that the sand is transferred to the correct adjacent hourglass. This should now provide the expected output with the given input data.

The results still differ because the updated solution does not correctly manage the state of the clepsydra when it is inverted (position 2). When it is inverted, the sand should fall from the lower part of an hourglass to the upper part of the next hourglass above it, not the other way around. Additionally, the solution needs to handle the case when the clepsydra is flipped back to position 1 after being in position 2.

Let's fix the implementation of the sand transfer to correctly handle the inversion and reversion of the clepsydra:

```python
# Function to simulate the first experiment
def first_experiment(n, b):
    # The time taken is simply n seconds for each hourglass plus the initial b seconds
    return (n - 1) + b

# Function to simulate the second experiment
def second_experiment(n, b, k, states):
    # Lists for upper and lower compartments, initially filled with b at the top of the first
    upper = [b] + [0] * (n - 1)
    lower = [0] * n

    # Process each state
    for seconds, position in states:
        for _ in range(seconds):
            # When position is 1, the sand falls from upper to the lower of the same hourglass, and then to the upper of the next hourglass
            if position == 1:
                for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):  # Start from the last hourglass
                    # Check if there's sand in the upper part
                    if upper[j] > 0:
                        sand_to_fall = 1
                        upper[j] -= sand_to_fall
                        lower[j] += sand_to_fall
                        # If not the last hourglass, let the sand fall to the next upper hourglass

This solution should now correctly simulate the behavior of the clepsydra when it is turned to both positions and should provide the expected output for the given input data.

The discrepancy in results arises from incorrect handling of the sand transfer logic in the second experiment. The sand transfer needs to account for the following:

1. In position 1 (normal), the sand should move from the upper compartment of an hourglass to its lower compartment. If there's still sand left in the lower compartment, it should move to the upper compartment of the next hourglass (index + 1).
2. In position 2 (inverted), the sand should move from the lower compartment of an hourglass to the upper compartment of the previous hourglass (index - 1). If there's still sand left in the upper compartment, it should move to the lower compartment of the same hourglass.

Let's reimplement the second experiment with correct logic, and use a more step-by-step, iterative approach to make it clearer:

```python
# Function to simulate the second experiment
def second_experiment(n, b, k, states):
    # Initialize the upper and lower compartments of each hourglass
    upper_compartments = [0] * n
    lower_compartments = [0] * n
    # Fill the first hourglass's upper compartment with b sand grains
    upper_compartments[0] = b

    # Iterate through each state
    for seconds, position in states:
        for _ in range(seconds):
            # Simulate the sand transfer for each hourglass
            if position == 1:
                # Transfer sand from upper to lower in the same hourglass
                for i in range(n):
                    if upper_compartments[i] > 0:
                        upper_compartments[i] -= 1
                        lower_compartments[i] += 1
                # Transfer sand from lower of one to upper of the next hourglass
                for i in range(n - 1):
                    if lower_compartments[i] > 0:
                        lower_compartments[i] -= 1
                        upper_compartments[i + 1] += 1
            else:
                # Transfer sand from lower to upper in the same hourglass, in reverse
                for i in reversed(range(n)):
                    if lower_compartments[i] > 0:
                        lower_compartments[i] -= 1
                        upper_compartments[i] += 1
                # Transfer sand from upper of one to lower of the previous hourglass
                for i in range(1, n):
                    if upper_compartments[i] > 0:
                        upper_compartments[i] -= 1
                        lower_compartments[i - 1] += 1

    # Combine the upper and lower compartments into a final list of tuples
    final_state = list(zip(upper_compartments, lower_compartments))
    return final_state

# Reading input data, calculating the results, and writing output data remains the same
# ...

# Reading input data
with open('clepsidru.in', 'r') as file:
    n, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    states = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Calculate the results for the two experiments
exp1_result = first_experiment(n, b)
exp2_result = second_experiment(n, b, k, states)

# Writing output data
with open('clepsidru.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{exp1_result}\n')
    for upper, lower in exp2_result:
        file.write(f'{upper} {lower}\n')
```

In this corrected solution, we ensure that sand grains are transferred one by one correctly following the rules of the experiment for both positions. The sand transferred from the lower compartment to the upper compartment of the previous hourglass (in the inverted position) is done in a separate loop to avoid any interference with the ongoing transfers within the same hourglass. This approach should give the expected output.

The error is caused by the fact that I did not include the definition of the `first_experiment` function in the final code snippet. This was an oversight, and I need to ensure that the definition is present when I rewrite the entire solution. Let's provide the complete, corrected version of the solution that should work as expected:

```python
# Function to simulate the first experiment
def first_experiment(n, b):
    # The time taken is the sum of all intervals (1+2+...+n) with the initial b seconds
    # minus 1 because the last grain does not need to fall through all hourglasses
    return n + (b - 1)

# Function to simulate the second experiment
def second_experiment(n, b, k, states):
    # Initialize the upper and lower compartments of each hourglass
    upper_compartments = [0] * n
    lower_compartments = [0] * n
    # Fill the first hourglass's upper compartment with b sand grains
    upper_compartments[0] = b

    # Iterate through each state
    for seconds, position in states:
        for _ in range(seconds):
            # Simulate the sand transfer for each hourglass
            # Transfer sand from upper to lower in the same hourglass
            for i in range(n):
                if upper_compartments[i] > 0:
                    upper_compartments[i] -= 1
                    lower_compartments[i] += 1
            if position == 1:
                # Transfer sand from lower of one to upper of the next hourglass
                for i in range(n - 1):
                    if lower_compartments[i] > 0:
                        lower_compartments[i] -= 1
                        upper_compartments[i + 1] += 1
            else:
                # Transfer sand from upper of one to lower of the previous hourglass in reverse order
                for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
                    if upper_compartments[i] > 0:
                        upper_compartments[i] -= 1
                        lower_compartments[i - 1] += 1

    # Combine the upper and lower compartments into a final list of tuples
    final_state = list(zip(upper_compartments, lower_compartments))
    return final_state

# Read input data
with open('clepsidru.in', 'r') as file:
    n, b = map(int, file.readline().split())
    k = int(file.readline().strip())
    states = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(k)]

# Calculate the results for the two experiments
exp1_result = first_experiment(n, b)
exp2_result = second_experiment(n, b, k, states)

# Write output data
with open('clepsidru.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f'{exp1_result}\n')
    for upper, lower in exp2_result:
        file.write(f'{upper} {lower}\n')
```

This code includes the correct definition for the `first_experiment` function and the corrected transfer logic in the `second_experiment` function. It should now execute without errors and produce the expected output for the given input data.
