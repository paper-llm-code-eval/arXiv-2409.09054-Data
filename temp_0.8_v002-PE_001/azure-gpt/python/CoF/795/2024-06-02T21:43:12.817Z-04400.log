The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since the program has strict memory limits and is not allowed to use external libraries, the solution should be implemented without `numpy`.

There are several issues with the previous solution. Let's address them one by one.

1. The calculation for the last digit sum is incorrect. We need to calculate the sum of the numbers considering the series' pattern with up to k digits.
2. The successor function is also incorrect. It does not account for the series' cyclic pattern where the digits are rotated.
3. The counting function for terms with the most significant digit equal to 'a' and not containing 'b' is incorrect. We need to consider the series' rotation pattern and not just permutations.

Let's fix these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to compute the last digit of the sum of all series terms with at most k digits
def last_digit_sum(k):
    last_digit = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for start in range(1, 10):
            num_str = ''.join(str((start + i) % 10) for i in range(length))
            last_digit += int(num_str)
    return last_digit % 10

# Function to find the successor of a given term in the series
def find_successor(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    length = len(x_str)
    if length == 1:
        return (x % 9) + 1
    start_digit = int(x_str[0])
    if start_digit == length:
        return int('1' + x_str[:-1])
    return int(x_str[1:] + str(start_digit + 1))

# Function to count the terms with most significant digit equal to a and not containing b
def count_terms(a, b, k):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        if length == 1:
            if a != b:
                count += 1
        else:
            for start in range(1, 10):
                if length > 9 and (a > 1 or b > 1):  # Impossible to have length greater than 9 without repeating digits
                    continue
                if start == a and str(b) not in ''.join(str((start + i) % 10) for i in range(length)):
                    count += 1
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate the three required values
last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
count = count_terms(a, b, k)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{last_digit}\n{successor}\n{count}\n")
```

This revised solution should correctly:

1. Calculate the last digit by summing the numbers according to the series' pattern, taking the sum modulo 10 to get the last digit.
2. Find the successor by rotating the digits and adjusting the starting digit.
3. Count the terms according to the series' rotation pattern, considering only terms that have 'a' as the most significant digit and do not contain 'b'.

Let's correct the issues with the previous solution:

1. The calculation for the last digit sum was incorrect. We should take into account the pattern of the sequence where each term is formed by rotating the previous term.
2. The successor function was slightly incorrect. We need to correctly increment and rotate the digits to match the sequence pattern.
3. The count terms function was correct, but we need to ensure that we're generating the sequence terms correctly for comparison.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Function to compute the last digit of the sum of all series terms with at most k digits
def last_digit_sum(k):
    last_digit = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        # Calculate the sum for each length
        for num in range(1, 10):  # Start from 1 to 9 for each length
            for i in range(length):
                last_digit += (num + i) % 10
    return last_digit % 10

# Function to find the successor of a given term in the series
def find_successor(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    length = len(x_str)
    start_digit = int(x_str[0])
    if start_digit == length:
        # If the first digit is equal to the length, then rotate the series
        return int(x_str[1:] + '1')
    else:
        # Rotate and increment the first digit
        return int(x_str[1:] + str(start_digit + 1))

# Function to count the terms with most significant digit equal to a and not containing b
def count_terms(a, b, k):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        # Generate all terms of the given length and check for the conditions
        for start in range(1, 10):  # Start digit
            if start == a:  # The first digit must be 'a'
                term = ''.join(str((start + i) % 10) for i in range(length))
                if str(b) not in term:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate the three required values
last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
count = count_terms(a, b, k)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{last_digit}\n{successor}\n{count}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly:

1. Calculate the last digit of the sum by following the series' pattern.
2. Find the successor by rotating the digits and incrementing the first digit if it is less than the length of the number.
3. Count the valid terms with 'a' as the most significant digit and without containing 'b'.

The previous solutions had several mistakes in understanding the series pattern and the rules for the successor and sum calculation. Let's correct these mistakes and provide a solution that properly addresses the challenge requirements.

1. The series pattern is cyclic, where the digits are rotated left, and each rotation increases the length of the number when all digits up to the length are present.
2. To find the successor, we should rotate the number and handle the case when the rotation leads to an increase in length.
3. To count the terms with the most significant digit equal to 'a' and not containing 'b', we need to generate all possible terms according to the series rules, then apply the conditions.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
# Function to compute the last digit of the sum of all series terms with at most k digits
def last_digit_sum(k):
    last_digit = 0
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for start in range(1, 10):
            for i in range(length):
                count += 1
                last_digit = (last_digit + (start + i - 1) % 9 + 1) % 10
    return last_digit

# Function to find the successor of a given term in the series
def find_successor(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    length = len(x_str)
    if set(x_str) == {str(i) for i in range(1, length + 1)}:
        return int('1' * (length + 1))
    else:
        new_start = str((int(x_str[0]) % length) + 1)
        return int(x_str[1:] + new_start)

# Function to count the terms with most significant digit equal to a and not containing b
def count_terms(a, b, k):
    count = 0
    # Loop through the lengths up to k
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for start in range(1, 10):
            if start == a or (length == 1 and start == a):
                term = [(start + i - 1) % 9 + 1 for i in range(length)]
                if b not in term:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Read the input from 'sir.in'
with open('sir.in', 'r') as fin:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, fin.readline().split())

# Calculate the three required values
last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
count = count_terms(a, b, k)

# Write the output to 'sir.out'
with open('sir.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{last_digit}\n{successor}\n{count}\n")
```

This solution carefully considers the pattern of the series and applies the logic to find the last digit sum, the successor, and count the terms that meet the given conditions.

The output for the last digit sum is now correct, but the successor function is still incorrect based on the expected output. The series pattern is a cyclic permutation of the digits from 1 to the number's length, and the successor is the next permutation in the sequence. If the number is the last permutation for that length (e.g., `321` for length 3), the successor is the first permutation of the next length (e.g., `1234` for length 4). The count terms function is also producing the correct output, so we will focus on fixing the successor function.

Here is the revised solution with the corrected successor function:

```python
# Helper function to generate the next term in the series based on the current term
def next_in_series(current):
    number_str = str(current)
    length = len(number_str)
    if int(number_str) == int(''.join(str(i) for i in range(length, 0, -1))):  # If it's the last permutation
        return int('1' * (length + 1))  # Go to the next length's first term
    else:
        # Find the next permutation by rotating the digits to the left
        return int(number_str[1:] + number_str[0])

# Function to find the successor of a given term in the series
def find_successor(x):
    return next_in_series(x)

# Function to compute the last digit of the sum of all series terms with at most k digits
def last_digit_sum(k):
    sum_last_digit = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for start_digit in range(1, 10):
            for i in range(length):
                sum_last_digit += (start_digit + i - 1) % 9 + 1
    return sum_last_digit % 10

# Function to count terms with most significant digit 'a' and not containing digit 'b'
def count_terms(a, b, k):
    count = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        for start_digit in range(1, 10):
            term_str = ''.join(str((start_digit + i - 1) % 9 + 1) for i in range(length))
            if term_str[0] == str(a) and str(b) not in term_str:
                count += 1
    return count

# Read input
with open('sir.in', 'r') as file:
    k, x, a, b = map(int, file.readline().strip().split())

# Compute outputs
sum_last_digit = last_digit_sum(k)
successor = find_successor(x)
terms_count = count_terms(a, b, k)

# Write output
with open('sir.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{sum_last_digit}\n{successor}\n{terms_count}\n")
```

This solution should correctly compute the successor of the series and match all the expected outputs.
