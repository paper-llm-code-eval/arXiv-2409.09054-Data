Gigel este un mare pasionat al cifrelor. Orice moment liber şi-l petrece jucându-se cu numere. Jucându-se astfel, într-o zi a scris pe hârtie $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi a observat că printre acestea există două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală. Desigur, Gigel a crezut că este o întâmplare şi a scris alte $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi spre surpriza lui, după un timp a găsit din nou două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală.

# Cerinţă
Date $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre, determinaţi numărul de perechi de submulţimi **disjuncte** de sumă egală care se pot forma cu numere din cele date, precum şi una dintre aceste perechi pentru care suma numerelor din fiecare dintre cele două submulţimi este maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `numere.in` conţine pe prima linie $10$ numere naturale distincte separate prin câte un spaţiu $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_{10}$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `numere.out` conţine trei linii. Pe prima linie se află numărul de perechi de submulţimi de sumă egală şi suma maximă obţinută, separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe linia a doua se află elementele primei submulţimi separate prin câte un spațiu, iar pe linia a treia se află elementele celei de a doua submulţimi separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 99$, pentru $1 \leq i \leq 10$
- $1 \leq k, p \leq 9$
- Ordinea submulţimilor în perechi nu contează.
- Perechea de submulţimi determinată nu este obligatoriu unică.

                if combined_sum > max_sum:

    sums_dict[current_set_sum].append(current_index_set)

# Prepare the output data.
max_subset1 = [numbers[idx] for idx in max_pair[0]]
max_subset2 = [numbers[idx] for idx in max_pair[1]]

# Write the output to the file.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset1)) + "\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset2)) + "\n")
```
This code should solve the problem efficiently by using bitwise operations to iterate through subsets and a dictionary to keep track of the sums we've seen. It avoids unnecessary memory consumption by storing only subset indexes in the dictionary. The output is then written to 'numere.out'.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available in the execution environment. Since the provided code does not actually use `numpy`, we can simply remove the import statement from the code.

Here is the revised solution without the `numpy` import:

```python
# Read the numbers from the file.
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize the sum and count of pairs.
max_sum = 0
count_pairs = 0
max_pair = (set(), set())

# Calculate the total sum of the numbers.
total_sum = sum(numbers)

# We use a dictionary to store the sum and the corresponding subsets indexes.
sums_dict = {}

# Iterate through all possible subsets using bitwise representation.
for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
    current_set_sum = 0
    current_index_set = set()
    
    # Generate the subset and calculate the sum.
    for j in range(len(numbers)):
        if i & (1 << j):
            current_set_sum += numbers[j]
            current_index_set.add(j)
    
    # If the sum is already in the dictionary and the subsets are disjoint, we found a pair.
    if current_set_sum in sums_dict:
        for prev_set in sums_dict[current_set_sum]:
            if current_index_set.isdisjoint(prev_set):
                count_pairs += 1
                combined_sum = current_set_sum * 2
                if combined_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = combined_sum
                    max_pair = (current_index_set, prev_set)
    
    # Add the current subset to the dictionary.
    if current_set_sum not in sums_dict:
        sums_dict[current_set_sum] = []
    sums_dict[current_set_sum].append(current_index_set)

# Prepare the output data.
max_subset1 = [numbers[idx] for idx in max_pair[0]]
max_subset2 = [numbers[idx] for idx in max_pair[1]]

# Write the output to the file.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset1)) + "\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset2)) + "\n")
```

This code should now run correctly in an environment where `numpy` is not installed. It retains the same logic and will produce the correct output in the specified format in 'numere.out'.

The issue with the previous solution is that it's incorrectly calculating the maximum sum. When we identify a pair of subsets with equal sums, the combined sum is counted twice, which is incorrect. We should only count the sum once. Additionally, we should not consider the total sum of all numbers in this context, as it's irrelevant to finding subsets with equal sums.

Furthermore, the expected output shows the subsets in increasing order, so we need to sort the elements of the subsets before writing them to the file. 

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read the numbers from the file.
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize the sum and count of pairs.
max_sum = 0
max_pair = (set(), set())

# We use a dictionary to store the sum and the corresponding subsets indexes.
sums_dict = {}

# Iterate through all possible subsets using bitwise representation.
for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
    current_set_sum = 0
    current_index_set = set()
    
    # Generate the subset and calculate the sum.
    for j in range(len(numbers)):
        if i & (1 << j):
            current_set_sum += numbers[j]
            current_index_set.add(j)
    
    # If the sum is already in the dictionary and the subsets are disjoint, we found a pair.
    if current_set_sum in sums_dict:
        for prev_set in sums_dict[current_set_sum]:
            if current_index_set.isdisjoint(prev_set):
                # Only update max sum and max pair if the current set sum is greater than max_sum.
                if current_set_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = current_set_sum
                    max_pair = (current_index_set, prev_set)
        
        # Add the current subset to the dictionary for future pairing.
        sums_dict[current_set_sum].append(current_index_set)
    else:
        # Add the current subset to the dictionary.
        sums_dict[current_set_sum] = [current_index_set]

# Count the number of pairs after finding the max pair.
count_pairs = sum(len(s) * (len(s) - 1) // 2 for s in sums_dict.values() if len(s) > 1)

# Prepare the output data by ordering the numbers in each subset.
max_subset1 = sorted([numbers[idx] for idx in max_pair[0]])
max_subset2 = sorted([numbers[idx] for idx in max_pair[1]])

# Write the output to the file.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset1)) + "\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset2)) + "\n")
```
In this rewritten solution, we first find the max pair and max sum, and then we count the number of pairs. We also sort the subsets before writing them to the output file to match the expected result. This should now produce the correct output that matches the expected result.

The error in the previous solution is related to the calculation of the number of pairs of subsets with equal sums. The expected output indicates that we should find 65 pairs, but the program is incorrectly calculating 1176 pairs. This suggests that the program is counting every possible combination of subsets in the sums dictionary, which is incorrect. We should only count distinct pairs of subsets, and only once for each pair.

Let's fix the solution. We will also need to update the way we calculate the number of pairs:

```python
# Read the numbers from the file.
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
numbers.sort()

# Initialize the sum and count of pairs.
max_sum = 0
count_pairs = 0
max_pair = (set(), set())

# Use a dictionary to store the sum and corresponding subsets (as frozensets so they are hashable).
sums_dict = {}

# Iterate through all possible subsets using bitwise representation.
for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
    current_set = set()
    current_set_sum = 0
    
    # Generate the subset and calculate the sum.
    for j in range(len(numbers)):
        if i & (1 << j):
            current_set.add(numbers[j])
            current_set_sum += numbers[j]

    # If the sum is already in the dictionary, check for disjoint subsets.
    if current_set_sum in sums_dict:
        for prev_set in sums_dict[current_set_sum]:
            if not current_set.intersection(prev_set):
                count_pairs += 1  # Found a disjoint pair of subsets with the same sum.
                if current_set_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = current_set_sum
                    max_pair = (prev_set, current_set)
    # Add the current subset to the dictionary.
    sums_dict.setdefault(current_set_sum, []).append(frozenset(current_set))

# Prepare the output data.
max_subset1 = sorted(max_pair[0])
max_subset2 = sorted(max_pair[1])

# Write the output to the file.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset1)) + "\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset2)) + "\n")
```

This solution will now correctly calculate the number of distinct pairs of subsets with equal sums. The subsets in the max pair are sorted before writing them to the output file. This should produce the correct output as expected.

The previous solution correctly calculates the number of pairs and the maximum sum. However, it doesn't match the expected output due to the ordering of the numbers in the subsets. The issue is not with the logic but with the output formatting. It seems that the expected output requires the subsets in the maximal pair to be displayed in ascending order, which the program is already doing, but the order of the pairs themselves also seems to matter. The pair with smaller numbers should come first.

To fix this, we can compare the smallest elements in the two maximum subsets and switch them if necessary so that the subset with the smaller minimum comes first in the output.

Let's correct this ordering issue and rewrite the solution accordingly:

```python
# Read the numbers from the file.
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize the sum and count of pairs.
max_sum = 0
count_pairs = 0
max_pair = (set(), set())

# Use a dictionary to store the sum and corresponding subsets (as frozensets so they are hashable).
sums_dict = {}

# Iterate through all possible subsets using bitwise representation.
for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
    current_set = set()
    current_set_sum = 0
    
    # Generate the subset and calculate the sum.
    for j in range(len(numbers)):
        if i & (1 << j):
            current_set.add(numbers[j])
            current_set_sum += numbers[j]

    # If the sum is already in the dictionary, check for disjoint subsets.
    if current_set_sum in sums_dict:
        for prev_set in sums_dict[current_set_sum]:
            if current_set.isdisjoint(prev_set):
                count_pairs += 1  # Found a disjoint pair of subsets with the same sum.
                if current_set_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = current_set_sum
                    max_pair = (prev_set, current_set)
    # Add the current subset to the dictionary.
    sums_dict.setdefault(current_set_sum, []).append(frozenset(current_set))

# Ensure the first subset in the max pair has the smallest minimum element.
if min(max_pair[0]) > min(max_pair[1]):
    max_pair = (max_pair[1], max_pair[0])

# Prepare the output data.
max_subset1 = sorted(max_pair[0])
max_subset2 = sorted(max_pair[1])

# Write the output to the file.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset1)) + "\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset2)) + "\n")
```

Now the program should output the two maximal subsets in the correct order, with the subset containing the smaller numbers coming first. This should match the expected result.

The output is still incorrect because the two subsets are not being sorted within the output file as they should be according to the expected output. The expected output has the subsets listed with their elements in decreasing order, not increasing order as the solution currently does.

Let's correct this and rewrite the solution with the subsets' elements in decreasing order:

```python
# Read the numbers from the file.
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Initialize the sum and count of pairs.
max_sum = 0
count_pairs = 0
max_pair = (set(), set())

# Use a dictionary to store the sum and corresponding subsets (as frozensets so they are hashable).
sums_dict = {}

# Iterate through all possible subsets using bitwise representation.
for i in range(1, 1 << len(numbers)):
    current_set = set()
    current_set_sum = 0
    
    # Generate the subset and calculate the sum.
    for j in range(len(numbers)):
        if i & (1 << j):
            current_set.add(numbers[j])
            current_set_sum += numbers[j]

    # If the sum is already in the dictionary, check for disjoint subsets.
    if current_set_sum in sums_dict:
        for prev_set in sums_dict[current_set_sum]:
            if current_set.isdisjoint(prev_set):
                count_pairs += 1  # Found a disjoint pair of subsets with the same sum.
                if current_set_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = current_set_sum
                    max_pair = (prev_set, current_set)
    # Add the current subset to the dictionary.
    sums_dict.setdefault(current_set_sum, []).append(frozenset(current_set))

# Sort the subsets of the max pair in decreasing order.
max_subset1 = sorted(max_pair[0], reverse=True)
max_subset2 = sorted(max_pair[1], reverse=True)

# Ensure the subset with the larger first element comes first in the output.
if max_subset1[0] < max_subset2[0]:
    max_subset1, max_subset2 = max_subset2, max_subset1

# Write the output to the file.
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count_pairs} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset1)) + "\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_subset2)) + "\n")
```

This version of the solution will output the subsets with elements in the correct decreasing order and make sure that the subset with the larger first element comes first in the output. The solution should now provide the expected result.
