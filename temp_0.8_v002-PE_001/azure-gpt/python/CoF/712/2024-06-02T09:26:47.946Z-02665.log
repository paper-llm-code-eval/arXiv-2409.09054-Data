Gigel este un mare pasionat al cifrelor. Orice moment liber şi-l petrece jucându-se cu numere. Jucându-se astfel, într-o zi a scris pe hârtie $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi a observat că printre acestea există două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală. Desigur, Gigel a crezut că este o întâmplare şi a scris alte $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi spre surpriza lui, după un timp a găsit din nou două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală.

# Cerinţă
Date $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre, determinaţi numărul de perechi de submulţimi **disjuncte** de sumă egală care se pot forma cu numere din cele date, precum şi una dintre aceste perechi pentru care suma numerelor din fiecare dintre cele două submulţimi este maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `numere.in` conţine pe prima linie $10$ numere naturale distincte separate prin câte un spaţiu $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_{10}$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `numere.out` conţine trei linii. Pe prima linie se află numărul de perechi de submulţimi de sumă egală şi suma maximă obţinută, separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe linia a doua se află elementele primei submulţimi separate prin câte un spațiu, iar pe linia a treia se află elementele celei de a doua submulţimi separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 99$, pentru $1 \leq i \leq 10$
- $1 \leq k, p \leq 9$
- Ordinea submulţimilor în perechi nu contează.
- Perechea de submulţimi determinată nu este obligatoriu unică.

`numere.in`

`numere.out`

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = np.array(list(map(int, file.readline().split())), dtype=np.int32)

# Function to generate all unique subset sums with their respective subsets
def gen_subsets(nums):
    length = len(nums)
    subset_sums = {0: []}
    for num in nums:
        new_sums = {}
        for s in subset_sums:
            new_sum = s + num
            if new_sum not in subset_sums: # Avoid duplicates
                new_sums[new_sum] = subset_sums[s] + [num]
        subset_sums.update(new_sums)
    return subset_sums

# Generate subset sums for the given numbers
subset_sums = gen_subsets(numbers)

# Find the number of pairs and the pair with maximum sum
max_sum = 0
max_pair = None
count = 0
seen_sums = set()

for _sum, subset in subset_sums.items():
    if _sum in seen_sums or _sum == 0:
        continue
    other_subset = subset_sums.get(_sum, None)
    if other_subset != None and set(subset).isdisjoint(set(other_subset)):
        seen_sums.add(_sum)
        count += 1
        if _sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = _sum
            max_pair = (subset, other_subset)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
```

This solution reads the numbers from `numere.in`, computes all subset sums and their respective subsets, finds the number of disjunct subset pairs with equal sum and the pair with the maximum sum, and writes the output to `numere.out`. It uses numpy for efficient data manipulation and attempts to be memory efficient by only storing necessary information. 

Please ensure that the input file `numere.in` exists with the proper content before running the script, and the script has write permissions to create `numere.out`.

I apologize for the oversight. Given that numpy is not available, I will implement a solution without any external libraries, using only Python's standard library. Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Function to generate all unique subset sums with their respective subsets
def gen_subsets(nums):
    subset_sums = {0: []}
    for num in nums:
        new_sums = {}
        for s in subset_sums:
            new_sum = s + num
            if new_sum not in subset_sums:  # Avoid duplicates
                new_sums[new_sum] = subset_sums[s] + [num]
        subset_sums.update(new_sums)
    return subset_sums

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate subset sums for the given numbers
subset_sums = gen_subsets(numbers)

# Find the number of pairs and the pair with maximum sum
max_sum = 0
max_pair = None
count = 0
seen_sums = set()

for _sum, subset in subset_sums.items():
    if _sum in seen_sums or _sum == 0:
        continue
    other_subset = subset_sums.get(_sum, None)
    if other_subset is not None and set(subset).isdisjoint(set(other_subset)):
        seen_sums.add(_sum)
        count += 1
        if _sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = _sum
            max_pair = (subset, other_subset)

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
```

This solution should work without external libraries, staying within the limits of Python's standard library and the memory constraints specified. Make sure to run this script in an environment where you have write access to create `numere.out` and where `numere.in` is located with the correct input data.

It appears that the error is caused by the `max_pair` variable being `None`, which suggests that the script did not find any pairs of subsets with an equal sum. This could happen if there are indeed no such pairs in the input data, or if there's an issue with the logic of the script itself.

To fix the error, we must ensure that `max_pair` is not `None` before attempting to access its elements. We should also review the logic that finds the pairs to ensure there are no mistakes.

Here's the revised solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
# Function to generate all unique subset sums with their respective subsets
def gen_subsets(nums):
    subset_sums = {0: []}
    for num in nums:
        new_sums = {}
        for s in subset_sums:
            new_sum = s + num
            if new_sum not in subset_sums:  # Avoid duplicates
                new_sums[new_sum] = subset_sums[s] + [num]
        subset_sums.update(new_sums)
    return subset_sums

# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate subset sums for the given numbers
subset_sums = gen_subsets(numbers)

# Find the number of pairs and the pair with maximum sum
max_sum = 0
max_pair = (None, None)
count = 0
seen_sums = set()

# Check all possible subset sum pairs
for _sum in subset_sums:
    if _sum == 0 or _sum in seen_sums:
        continue
    for other_sum in subset_sums:
        # Check if it's a different subset and if the subsets are disjoint
        if _sum == other_sum and set(subset_sums[_sum]) != set(subset_sums[other_sum]):
            seen_sums.add(_sum)
            count += 1
            if _sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = _sum
                max_pair = (subset_sums[_sum], subset_sums[other_sum])

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
    if max_pair[0] is not None and max_pair[1] is not None:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write('No disjunct subset pairs with equal sum found.\n')
```

This solution includes a modification to check for the case when `max_pair` is `(None, None)`, which indicates that no disjunct subset pairs with equal sum were found. Additionally, the logic for finding the pairs has been revised to correctly handle the comparison between subsets. 

Make sure that `numere.in` is in the same directory as the script and includes the correct input for this code to run successfully.

The found output indicates that the algorithm is not correctly identifying pairs of disjunct subsets with equal sums. The logic to check for subset pairs is flawed. Specifically, comparing `_sum == other_sum` within the same loop is not the correct approach as it will compare all subsets with the same sum, including comparing the same subset with itself. What we really want is to find two different subsets that do not share any elements but have the same sum.

We must revise the algorithm to correctly identify these pairs. One common approach is to use bitmasking to generate all possible subsets and then check for the conditions outlined in the problem statement. Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate all subsets using bitmasking
all_subsets = []
for mask in range(1 << len(numbers)):
    subset = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if mask & (1 << i)]
    all_subsets.append((sum(subset), subset))

# Sort the subsets by their sums to make it easier to find matching sums
all_subsets.sort()

# Find the number of pairs and the pair with maximum sum
max_sum = -1
max_pair = []
count = 0
for i in range(len(all_subsets)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(all_subsets)):
        if all_subsets[i][0] == all_subsets[j][0]:
            # Ensure the subsets are disjoint
            set_i = set(all_subsets[i][1])
            set_j = set(all_subsets[j][1])
            if set_i.isdisjoint(set_j):
                count += 1
                if all_subsets[i][0] > max_sum:
                    max_sum = all_subsets[i][0]
                    max_pair = [all_subsets[i][1], all_subsets[j][1]]

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
    if max_pair:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write('No disjunct subset pairs with equal sum found.\n')
```

This solution uses bitmasking to generate all possible subsets and their sums, sorts them, and then finds matching sums among disjoint subsets. The output is the count of such pairs, the maximum sum found, and one such pair of subsets with the maximum sum. Make sure that `numere.in` is in the same directory as the script and contains the correct input for this code to run successfully.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result lies in the order of the output subsets. The problem statement specifies that the order of submultimens does not matter; hence both outputs should be considered correct. However, the example output provided does show an expected order. If we want to match the exact output, we can sort the subsets before writing them to the file, but as the problem statement says "Ordinea submulţimilor în perechi nu contează." ("The order of the subsets in pairs does not matter."), the output of the current solution is valid.

Nevertheless, if strict ordering is desired in the output, we can ensure that the subset with the smaller first element comes first. Here is the updated code to ensure this ordering.

```python
# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate all subsets using bitmasking
all_subsets = []
for mask in range(1 << len(numbers)):
    subset = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if mask & (1 << i)]
    all_subsets.append((sum(subset), subset))

# Sort the subsets by their sums
all_subsets.sort()

# Find the number of pairs and the pair with maximum sum
max_sum = -1
max_pair = []
count = 0
for i in range(len(all_subsets)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(all_subsets)):
        if all_subsets[i][0] == all_subsets[j][0]:
            # Ensure the subsets are disjoint
            set_i = set(all_subsets[i][1])
            set_j = set(all_subsets[j][1])
            if set_i.isdisjoint(set_j):
                count += 1
                if all_subsets[i][0] > max_sum:
                    max_sum = all_subsets[i][0]
                    max_pair = [sorted(all_subsets[i][1]), sorted(all_subsets[j][1])]

# Sort the pair of subsets by the first element of each subset
max_pair.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
    if max_pair:
        for subset in max_pair:
            file.write(' '.join(map(str, subset)) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write('No disjunct subset pairs with equal sum found.\n')
```

This update ensures that the subsets within the pair are sorted individually and then the pair is sorted based on the first element of each subset. This will give us an output where the subsets are ordered by their first elements, which should match the example output, keeping in mind that the actual problem requirement does not specify a need for any particular ordering.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to the sorting of the individual subsets before comparing their first elements. My previous correction mistakenly sorted the individual subsets, altering their natural order, and then sorted the pairs based on the first element. This is not necessary because we only need to sort the pairs based on the first element of each subset without sorting the subsets themselves.

The problem requires us to print one of the pairs of subsets with the maximum sum. To match the expected output, we need to make sure the lower subset (in terms of the natural order of elements) comes first in the output file.

Here's the updated solution with the correct output ordering:

```python
# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate all subsets using bitmasking
all_subsets = []
for mask in range(1 << len(numbers)):
    subset = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if mask & (1 << i)]
    all_subsets.append((sum(subset), subset))

# Sort the subsets by their sums
all_subsets.sort()

# Find the number of pairs and the pair with maximum sum
max_sum = -1
max_pair = []
count = 0
for i in range(len(all_subsets)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(all_subsets)):
        if all_subsets[i][0] == all_subsets[j][0]:
            # Ensure the subsets are disjoint
            set_i = set(all_subsets[i][1])
            set_j = set(all_subsets[j][1])
            if set_i.isdisjoint(set_j):
                count += 1
                if all_subsets[i][0] > max_sum:
                    max_sum = all_subsets[i][0]
                    # Ensure max_pair[0] is the subset with the smaller first element
                    if all_subsets[i][1][0] < all_subsets[j][1][0]:
                        max_pair = [all_subsets[i][1], all_subsets[j][1]]
                    else:
                        max_pair = [all_subsets[j][1], all_subsets[i][1]]

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
    if max_pair:
        for subset in max_pair:
            file.write(' '.join(map(str, subset)) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write('No disjunct subset pairs with equal sum found.\n')
```

This code should now output the two subsets in the correct order as per the example given, with the lower subset first, without sorting the elements within the subset themselves. Please ensure `numere.in` exists with the proper content before running this script.

The previous solution correctly identified the number of disjunct subset pairs with equal sums and even found the correct pair with the maximum sum. However, it did not ensure that the first subset in the output file has the smallest possible first element, which caused the two subsets to appear in reverse order compared to the expected output.

It seems that the given expected output prefers to list the subset containing the smaller numbers first. We need to adjust our code to ensure that the subset which starts with the smallest number comes first in the output.

Here is the updated solution, which ensures that the subset with the smallest starting number is written first:

```python
# Read input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Generate all subsets using bitmasking
all_subsets = []
for mask in range(1 << len(numbers)):
    subset = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if mask & (1 << i)]
    all_subsets.append((sum(subset), subset))

# Find the number of pairs and the pair with maximum sum
max_sum = -1
max_pair = ([], [])
count = 0
for i in range(len(all_subsets)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(all_subsets)):
        if all_subsets[i][0] == all_subsets[j][0]:
            # Ensure the subsets are disjoint
            set_i = set(all_subsets[i][1])
            set_j = set(all_subsets[j][1])
            if set_i.isdisjoint(set_j):
                count += 1
                if all_subsets[i][0] > max_sum:
                    max_sum = all_subsets[i][0]
                    # Determine the order based on the smallest element in each subset
                    if min(all_subsets[i][1]) < min(all_subsets[j][1]):
                        max_pair = (all_subsets[i][1], all_subsets[j][1])
                    else:
                        max_pair = (all_subsets[j][1], all_subsets[i][1])

# Write output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{count} {max_sum}\n")
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    file.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
```

This solution should now produce the correct order in the output file, with the subset that contains the smallest number listed first. It is important to ensure that `numere.in` is placed appropriately before running this script.
