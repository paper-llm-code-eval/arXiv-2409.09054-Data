Gigel este un mare pasionat al cifrelor. Orice moment liber şi-l petrece jucându-se cu numere. Jucându-se astfel, într-o zi a scris pe hârtie $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi a observat că printre acestea există două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală. Desigur, Gigel a crezut că este o întâmplare şi a scris alte $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre şi spre surpriza lui, după un timp a găsit din nou două submulţimi disjuncte de sumă egală.

# Cerinţă
Date $10$ numere distincte de câte două cifre, determinaţi numărul de perechi de submulţimi **disjuncte** de sumă egală care se pot forma cu numere din cele date, precum şi una dintre aceste perechi pentru care suma numerelor din fiecare dintre cele două submulţimi este maximă.

# Date de intrare
Fişierul de intrare `numere.in` conţine pe prima linie $10$ numere naturale distincte separate prin câte un spaţiu $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_{10}$.

# Date de ieşire
Fişierul de ieşire `numere.out` conţine trei linii. Pe prima linie se află numărul de perechi de submulţimi de sumă egală şi suma maximă obţinută, separate printr-un spaţiu. Pe linia a doua se află elementele primei submulţimi separate prin câte un spațiu, iar pe linia a treia se află elementele celei de a doua submulţimi separate prin câte un spaţiu.

# Restricţii şi precizări
- $10 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 99$, pentru $1 \leq i \leq 10$
- $1 \leq k, p \leq 9$
- Ordinea submulţimilor în perechi nu contează.
- Perechea de submulţimi determinată nu este obligatoriu unică.

`numere.in`
```
60 49 86 78 23 97 69 71 32 10
```

`numere.out`
```

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
# code.py
import numpy as np

# Helper function to find the submultimi
def find_submultimi(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    sums = {0: []}
    max_sum = -np.inf
    max_pair = (None, None)

    # Iterate through all subsets
    for num in arr:
        curr_sums = list(sums.items())
        for sum_val, set_list in curr_sums:
            new_sum = sum_val + num
            new_set = set_list + [num]
            if new_sum not in sums:
                sums[new_sum] = new_set
                # Update max sum and max pair
                if new_sum > max_sum and new_sum in sums:
                    max_sum = new_sum
                    max_pair = (sums[new_sum], sums[max_sum - new_sum])
            else:
                # If this sum can be made by another disjoint subset
                if not set(new_set) & set(sums[new_sum]):
                    max_pair = (new_set, sums[new_sum])
                    max_sum = new_sum

    return len(sums) - 1, max_sum, max_pair

# Read data from input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    numbers = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Find submultimi
pair_count, max_sum, (max_set1, max_set2) = find_submultimi(numbers)

# Write output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{pair_count} {max_sum}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_set1)) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_set2)) + '\n')
```

This code should be saved as `code.py` and executed. Make sure that the input file `numere.in` is in the same directory as `code.py`. After running, `numere.out` will contain the result in the required format. The code uses dynamic programming to store sums of subsets of the input numbers, and it finds the pair of disjoint subsets with the maximum sum. The memory consumption is optimized by storing only sums and their corresponding subsets, and by not generating all subsets explicitly. The time complexity of the solution is roughly O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the input (in this case, 10). This is because the algorithm iterates through each number and for each number, it goes through the current sums to find new sums and their corresponding subsets. However, the number of elements is small enough that this should execute quickly on most modern hardware.

Remember to replace the example content of `numere.in` with the actual input when running the code.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the code is being executed. Since the requirement is to optimize both time and memory usage, and the memory limit is ~8MB, it's better to avoid using `numpy` for this challenge, as it is an additional library that may consume more memory.

We can rewrite the solution using Python's built-in data types and functions, which should be more memory efficient. Here is the entire solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# code.py

# Helper function to find the submultimi
def find_submultimi(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    sums = {0: []}
    max_sum = -float('inf')
    max_pair = (None, None)

    # Iterate through all subsets
    for num in arr:
        curr_sums = list(sums.items())
        for sum_val, set_list in curr_sums:
            new_sum = sum_val + num
            new_set = set_list + [num]
            if new_sum not in sums:
                sums[new_sum] = new_set
                # Update max sum and max pair
                if new_sum > max_sum and new_sum in sums:
                    max_sum = new_sum
                    max_pair = (sums[new_sum], sums[max_sum - new_sum])
            else:
                # If this sum can be made by another disjoint subset
                if not set(new_set) & set(sums[new_sum]):
                    max_pair = (new_set, sums[new_sum])
                    max_sum = new_sum

    return len(sums) - 1, max_sum, max_pair

# Read data from input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    numbers = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Find submultimi
pair_count, max_sum, (max_set1, max_set2) = find_submultimi(numbers)

# Write output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{pair_count} {max_sum}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_set1)) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_set2)) + '\n')
```

This code does not use `numpy` or any other external libraries, sticking to the Python standard library, which should ensure compatibility with environments that don't have `numpy` installed. This should also help stay within the memory limit specified in the problem statement.

The result differs because the code I provided earlier has a logical error in the way it tries to find all possible subsets and their sums. It adds each number to all existing sums and updates or creates entries in the `sums` dictionary. The `sums` dictionary is supposed to hold all possible sums and the subsets that create those sums, but the method used to update `sums` causes it to include all numbers in the final result, which is incorrect.

We need a way to correctly generate all possible subsets, calculate their sums, and then find pairs of subsets with equal sums. We should also ensure that these subsets are disjoint and keep track of the maximum sum.

Here is the corrected solution that implements a proper algorithm to solve the problem:

```python
# code.py

# Helper function to generate all subsets of a given set of numbers
def generate_subsets(numbers, index, current, all_subsets):
    if index == len(numbers):
        if current:
            all_subsets.append(current)
        return
    generate_subsets(numbers, index + 1, current, all_subsets)
    generate_subsets(numbers, index + 1, current + [numbers[index]], all_subsets)

# Read data from input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    numbers = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Generate all subsets of the array of numbers
all_subsets = []
generate_subsets(numbers, 0, [], all_subsets)

# Create a dictionary to store subsets with the same sum
sums_dict = {}
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ()
for subset in all_subsets:
    subset_sum = sum(subset)
    if subset_sum not in sums_dict:
        sums_dict[subset_sum] = [subset]
    else:
        # Check for disjoint subsets with the same sum
        for existing_subset in sums_dict[subset_sum]:
            if not set(subset).intersection(existing_subset):
                if subset_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = subset_sum
                    max_pair = (subset, existing_subset)
        sums_dict[subset_sum].append(subset)

# Calculate the number of pairs of subsets with equal sum
pairs_count = sum(len(s) * (len(s) - 1) // 2 for s in sums_dict.values())

# Write output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{pairs_count} {max_sum}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
```

This solution should create all possible subsets, store them in a dictionary by their sums, and then find all unique pairs of disjoint subsets that have the same sum. It also tracks the maximum sum and the corresponding pair of subsets. The output is then written to the `numere.out` file as specified.

The output is still incorrect because the calculation of the number of pairs of subsets with equal sums is incorrect. The previous code was counting all possible pairs within subsets of the same sum, but we only want to count the pairs of subsets that are disjoint. Additionally, since we're interested in the maximum sum of disjoint subsets, we should not extend this subset as soon as we find a matching sum in `sums_dict`.

Here is the corrected solution that includes a proper count of disjoint subset pairs and the correct retrieval of subsets leading to the maximum sum:

```python
# code.py

from itertools import combinations

# Read data from input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    numbers = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Generate all non-empty subsets of the array of numbers
all_subsets = []
for i in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
    for combo in combinations(numbers, i):
        all_subsets.append(combo)

# Create a dictionary to map sums to subsets
sums_dict = {}

# Process all subsets
for subset in all_subsets:
    subset_sum = sum(subset)
    if subset_sum in sums_dict:
        sums_dict[subset_sum].append(subset)
    else:
        sums_dict[subset_sum] = [subset]

# Find the number of pairs of subsets with equal sum and the maximum sum
pairs_count = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())

for sum_key, subsets in sums_dict.items():
    while len(subsets) > 1:
        s1 = subsets.pop()
        for s2 in subsets:
            if not set(s1).intersection(s2):
                pairs_count += 1
                if sum_key > max_sum:
                    max_sum = sum_key
                    max_pair = (s1, s2)

# Write output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{pairs_count} {max_sum}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
```

This solution correctly generates all non-empty subsets, maps them to their sums, and then identifies all unique pairs of disjoint subsets with the same sum. It counts these pairs correctly and identifies the pair with the maximum sum. The results are then written to the output file `numere.out`. This solution should match the expected output and adhere to the memory constraints of the problem.

The code outputted the correct number of pairs and the correct maximum sum, but the subsets themselves are in reverse order compared to the expected output. However, the problem statement specifies that the "Ordinea submulţimilor în perechi nu contează," which means that the order of the subsets in the pairs does not matter. Therefore, both the expected output and the output from the code are correct as per the problem statement, since the order of the subset pairs can be arbitrary.

The solution should be accepted as correct. However, if you require the subsets in the exact order as the expected output for consistency, we can add a step to sort the subsets before writing them to the output file.

Here's the final version of the solution with sorted subsets:

```python
# code.py

from itertools import combinations

# Read data from input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    numbers = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Generate all non-empty subsets of the array of numbers
all_subsets = []
for i in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
    for combo in combinations(numbers, i):
        all_subsets.append(combo)

# Create a dictionary to map sums to subsets
sums_dict = {}

# Process all subsets
for subset in all_subsets:
    subset_sum = sum(subset)
    if subset_sum in sums_dict:
        sums_dict[subset_sum].append(subset)
    else:
        sums_dict[subset_sum] = [subset]

# Find the number of pairs of subsets with equal sum and the maximum sum
pairs_count = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())

for sum_key, subsets in sums_dict.items():
    while len(subsets) > 1:
        s1 = subsets.pop()
        for s2 in subsets:
            if not set(s1).intersection(s2):
                pairs_count += 1
                if sum_key > max_sum:
                    max_sum = sum_key
                    max_pair = (s1, s2)

# Sort the subsets to match the expected output if necessary
max_pair = tuple(sorted(subset, reverse=True) for subset in max_pair)

# Write output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{pairs_count} {max_sum}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
```

This will ensure that the subsets are sorted in descending order before writing to the file, which should match the expected order in the given example. However, as per the problem statement, this step is not required, and the earlier solution is still valid.

The latest attempt to sort the subsets in descending order before writing to the file was incorrect because it sorted the numbers within each subset, not the subsets themselves.

We need to ensure that the order of the subsets in the output matches the expected output when the maximum sum is reached. Since the problem statement does not require subsets to be sorted in any particular order within themselves, we only need to sort the pairs of subsets such that the one with the smaller first element comes first in the output file.

Let's fix the solution to ensure that the pair with the smaller starting number comes first when writing the subsets that form the maximum sum:

```python
# code.py

from itertools import combinations

# Read data from input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    numbers = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Generate all non-empty subsets of the array of numbers
all_subsets = []
for i in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
    for combo in combinations(numbers, i):
        all_subsets.append(combo)

# Create a dictionary to map sums to subsets
sums_dict = {}

# Process all subsets
for subset in all_subsets:
    subset_sum = sum(subset)
    if subset_sum in sums_dict:
        sums_dict[subset_sum].append(subset)
    else:
        sums_dict[subset_sum] = [subset]

# Find the number of pairs of subsets with equal sum and the maximum sum
pairs_count = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())

for sum_key, subsets in sums_dict.items():
    for i, s1 in enumerate(subsets):
        for s2 in subsets[i+1:]:
            if not set(s1).intersection(s2):
                pairs_count += 1
                if sum_key > max_sum:
                    max_sum = sum_key
                    max_pair = (s1, s2) if s1[0] < s2[0] else (s2, s1)

# Write output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{pairs_count} {max_sum}\n")
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[0])) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, max_pair[1])) + '\n')
```

Now, this code ensures that for the maximum sum, the subset that starts with the smaller number is written first. This should make the output match the expected result, while still adhering to the problem statement's constraints.

The code is working correctly in terms of functionality, finding the correct number of disjoint subset pairs with equal sum (65), and the correct value for the maximum sum (276). However, the issue is with the ordering of the two subsets for the maximum sum pair when writing the output. According to the example expected output, the first subset should start with the larger number. My previous explanation missed this detail.

To make sure the output matches the expected result, we need to adjust the code to order the two subsets of the maximum sum pair such that the subset containing the larger starting number comes first in the output file.

Let's fix the solution to comply with the expected ordering:

```python
# code.py

from itertools import combinations

# Read data from input file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as fin:
    numbers = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Generate all non-empty subsets of the array of numbers
all_subsets = []
for i in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
    for combo in combinations(numbers, i):
        all_subsets.append(combo)

# Create a dictionary to map sums to subsets
sums_dict = {}

# Process all subsets
for subset in all_subsets:
    subset_sum = sum(subset)
    if subset_sum in sums_dict:
        sums_dict[subset_sum].append(subset)
    else:
        sums_dict[subset_sum] = [subset]

# Find the number of pairs of subsets with equal sum and the maximum sum
pairs_count = 0
max_sum = 0
max_pair = ((), ())

for sum_key, subsets in sums_dict.items():
    for i, s1 in enumerate(subsets):
        for s2 in subsets[i+1:]:
            if not set(s1).intersection(s2):
                pairs_count += 1
                if sum_key > max_sum:
                    max_sum = sum_key
                    # Sort so that the subset with the larger first element comes first
                    max_pair = (s1, s2) if s1[0] > s2[0] else (s2, s1)

# Write output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{pairs_count} {max_sum}\n")
    # Sort each subset in descending order before writing to match expected result format
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(max_pair[0], reverse=True))) + '\n')
    fout.write(' '.join(map(str, sorted(max_pair[1], reverse=True))) + '\n')
```

This code ensures that for the maximum sum pair, the subset with the larger first element comes first, and also sorts each subset in descending order to match the expected output format. This should produce an output that matches the expected result.
