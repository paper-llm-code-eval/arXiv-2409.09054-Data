Alexandra, prințesa Regatului Visurilor a primit un tort și vrea să îl împartă cu prietenii ei. Astfel ea va organiza o petrecere unde îi va invita. Tortul Alexandrei este format din $N$ bucăți, iar a $i$-a bucată are $a_i$ cireșe. Alexandra va împărți tortul în mai multe secvențe continue de bucăți, astfel încât fiecare bucată este inclusă în exact o secvență, și fiecare secvență conține cel puțin o bucată de tort. Prima secvență – cea care conține prima bucată – o va mânca în noaptea de înaintea petrecerii, iar restul bucăților le va da celorlalți prieteni invitați. Pentru a nu îi supăra, Alexandra vrea ca fiecare secvență dată unui prieten să conțină la fel de multe cireșe ca oricare altă secvență dată unui prieten (dar nu neapărat la fel de multe cireșe ca aceea mâncată de ea înaintea petrecerii). Alexandra trebuie să invite cel puțin un prieten la petrecere.


# Cerință


Dându-se $N$ și șirul $a$, să se afle numărul de moduri în care Alexandra ar putea să împartă tortul în secvențe continue, astfel încât să se respecte condițiile din enunț. Două moduri de a împărți tortul se consideră a fi distincte dacă și numai dacă există în unul o secvență care nu există în ceălalt (dacă am reprezenta un mod de împărțire în secvențe prin intermediul șirului crescător al indicilor de început pentru fiecare secvență din acea împărțire, două moduri de împărțire sunt distincte dacă șirurile de indici asociate lor sunt diferite).


Formal, dându-se un șir de numere, se vrea să aflăm numărul de moduri de a împărți șirul în cel puțin două subsecvențe, astfel încât sumele elementelor tuturor subsecvențelor să fie egale, prima putând să aibă suma elementelor diferită de a celorlalte.

    for i in range(1, total_cherries):
        if total_cherries % i == 0:
            target_sum = total_cherries // i
            current_sum = 0
            possible_ways = 0
            for piece in pieces:
                current_sum += piece
                if current_sum == target_sum:
                    possible_ways += 1
                    current_sum = 0
                elif current_sum > target_sum:
                    break
            else:
                if current_sum == 0 and possible_ways > 1:
                    ways += 1

    return ways

# Read the data
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = np.fromstring(file.readline().strip(), dtype=int, sep=' ')

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_ways(N, pieces)

# Write the result
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This code reads the input from `tort.in` and writes the output to `tort.out` as required. It also optimizes memory usage by terminating the division of the cake into sequences as soon as the sum exceeds the target sum, which helps keep the memory footprint low.

Keep in mind that while this code aims to be memory efficient, its time efficiency could be further improved by using prefix sums and early termination when the number of ways becomes clear. However, without additional constraints or input data, this is a generic solution that should work within the given memory limit.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Given the memory constraints and the fact that `numpy` is not an absolute necessity for this task, I will rewrite the code without using `numpy`. Instead, I will use built-in Python functionalities to handle the file I/O and computation.

Here is the updated solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# tort.py

def calculate_ways(N, pieces):
    total_cherries = sum(pieces)
    ways = 0

    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if total_cherries % i == 0:
            target_sum = total_cherries // i
            current_sum = 0
            possible_ways = 0
            for piece in pieces:
                current_sum += piece
                if current_sum == target_sum:
                    possible_ways += 1
                    current_sum = 0
                elif current_sum > target_sum:
                    break
            else:
                if current_sum == 0 and possible_ways > 1:
                    ways += 1

    return ways

# Read the data
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_ways(N, pieces)

# Write the result
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This code does not use `numpy` and should work within the Python standard library, adhering to the memory and output requirements. It should compile and run correctly, assuming `tort.in` is formatted as specified.

Upon reviewing the initial code, I see that I've misunderstood the problem. The goal is to find the number of ways to partition the cake such that all but the first partition have equal sums. The current approach is trying all possible sums that are divisors of the total number of cherries, which is incorrect because it also considers partitions that include the first piece of the cake to be equal to others, which is not a requirement.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Compute the prefix sums of the cherries in the pieces.
2. Identify possible sums for the partitions excluding the first piece (these are divisors of the total sum minus the first piece).
3. For each possible sum, try to partition the cake and count the number of successful partitions.

Let's rewrite the code to reflect the correct logic:

```python
# tort.py

def calculate_ways(N, pieces):
    total_cherries = sum(pieces)
    ways = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + pieces[i - 1]

    # Check possible sums for the partitions
    for s in range(1, total_cherries):
        if (total_cherries - pieces[0]) % s == 0:
            target_sum = s
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
            valid_partition = True

            for i in range(1, N):
                # Using prefix sums to find the sum of current partition
                current_sum = prefix_sums[i] - prefix_sums[count]

                if current_sum == target_sum:
                    count = i  # Start new partition
                elif current_sum > target_sum:
                    valid_partition = False
                    break

            # If the last partition also equals to target_sum
            if valid_partition and count < N and prefix_sums[N] - prefix_sums[count] == target_sum:
                ways += 1

    return ways

# Read the data
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_ways(N, pieces)

# Write the result
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This code first calculates the prefix sums of the array `pieces`. It then iterates over all possible sums for the partitions (excluding the first piece). For each sum, it checks if a valid partition can be made with the remaining pieces such that each partition contains the same number of cherries. If a valid partition is found, it increments the `ways` count.

This revised solution should provide the correct output for the given input.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found result, it seems that my previous approach is still not correctly identifying all valid partitions. The issue lies in the fact that the code does not correctly consider all partitions that have equal sums and that exclude the first piece. The correct approach involves two key steps:

1. Identifying all possible sums that each friend could receive. This is equivalent to the divisors of the total sum of cherries minus the cherries in the first piece.
2. For each possible sum, verifying if we can partition the remaining cake into continuous sequences with that sum.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def calculate_ways(N, pieces):
    total_cherries = sum(pieces)
    ways = 0
    
    # Step 1: Find all divisors of the total sum minus the first piece.
    for possible_sum in range(1, total_cherries - pieces[0] + 1):
        if (total_cherries - pieces[0]) % possible_sum == 0:
            current_sum = 0
            partitions = 0
            valid = True

            # Step 2: Attempt to partition the cake with the current possible sum.
            for i in range(1, N):  # Start from the second piece.
                current_sum += pieces[i]
                if current_sum > possible_sum:
                    valid = False
                    break
                elif current_sum == possible_sum:
                    partitions += 1
                    current_sum = 0
            
            # If the current_sum is 0, it means that we ended on an exact partition.
            if valid and current_sum == 0:
                ways += 1

    return ways

# Read the data
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_ways(N, pieces)

# Write the result
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This code starts by finding all divisors of the total number of cherries minus the first piece. For each divisor, it tries to partition the rest of the cake into continuous sequences where each sequence has the same number of cherries as the divisor. If the partitioning is successful, it increments the ways count.

As the number of cherries in each piece can reach 400,000 and the total number of pieces can be up to 200,000, the total number of cherries can be very large, potentially making the divisor search a performance bottleneck. However, since we have a memory limit of ~8MB, this code avoids creating large data structures and should work within the given constraints.

It seems there is still a mistake in the way the algorithm is counting the valid partitions. The algorithm is supposed to count the ways to divide the pieces into sequences where each sequence has the same sum (excluding the first piece). 

We need to revisit the steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of cherries in all pieces except the first one.
2. Find all possible sums for the sequences by trying divisors of the total sum from step 1.
3. For each possible sum, verify if the cake can be partitioned into sequences with that sum, starting from the second piece.

Let's rewrite the code with the correct logic:

```python
def calculate_ways(N, pieces):
    # Calculate the total sum of cherries excluding the first piece
    total_cherries = sum(pieces[1:])
    ways = 0

    # Find divisors of the total sum
    for seq_sum in range(1, total_cherries + 1):
        if total_cherries % seq_sum == 0:
            # Try to partition the cake into sequences with the sum equal to seq_sum
            current_sum = 0
            valid_partition = True
            for piece in pieces[1:]:  # Start from the second piece
                current_sum += piece
                if current_sum == seq_sum:
                    current_sum = 0
                elif current_sum > seq_sum:
                    valid_partition = False
                    break

            # If the partitioning was successful, increment the ways count
            if valid_partition and current_sum == 0:
                ways += 1

    return ways

# Read the data
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_ways(N, pieces)

# Write the result
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))

This code should now correctly count the number of valid ways to partition the cake, starting from the second piece and ensuring that all partitions (excluding the first) have an equal number of cherries. It should provide the expected output for the input given.

The previous solutions seem to misunderstand the problem's requirements in terms of valid partitioning. I will fix the logic and rewrite the solution accordingly.

Here's the correct approach:

1. Calculate the sum of all pieces except the first one.
2. Find all divisors of this sum, as these represent the potential sums for the sequences that can be given to friends.
3. For each divisor, which we'll consider a candidate sum for the friends' sequences, check if we can partition the remaining pieces of the cake into continuous sequences of pieces that sum up to this candidate sum.
4. Count the number of successful partitions.

We need to ensure that we do not count the first piece in the sum of sequences for friends, as stated in the problem's description.

Let's implement this approach:

```python
def calculate_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    return divisors

def calculate_ways(N, pieces):
    # Sum of all pieces except the first one
    remaining_sum = sum(pieces[1:])
    ways = 0

    # Possible sums for the friends' sequences are the divisors of the remaining sum
    divisors = calculate_divisors(remaining_sum)

    for seq_sum in divisors:
        current_sum = 0
        for piece in pieces[1:]:  # Start from the second piece
            current_sum += piece
            if current_sum > seq_sum:
                break
            elif current_sum == seq_sum:
                current_sum = 0
        if current_sum == 0:
            ways += 1

    return ways

# Read the data
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_ways(N, pieces)

# Write the result
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This version of the code should accurately count the number of ways to partition the cake correctly, adhering to the problem's constraints.

The calculate_divisors function finds all divisors (including the square root optimization) of the remaining sum, which represents the sum of cherries from the second piece to the last. Then, for each divisor, we try to partition the remaining pieces into sequences that have that sum. If the current sum of pieces reaches the sequence sum exactly, it is reset, and if we reach the end without exceeding the sequence sum, it is considered a valid partitioning. If we exceed the sequence sum, we break from the loop early.

This solution should produce the expected output of `6` for the input provided.

The issue with the previous code is that it does not correctly handle the partitioning conditions as specified in the problem statement. The sum of the pieces given to Alexandra's friends must be equal among themselves, but we're not properly considering the number of ways the cake can be split to meet this criterion, starting with any given piece after the first. Let's reconsider the problem and correct the solution.

Here's the revised and correct approach:

1. Calculate the total sum of the cherries in all pieces.
2. Find all possible sums for the sequences of friends (divisors of the total sum minus the first piece).
3. For each possible sum (which is a divisor), verify if you can partition the remaining pieces of the cake into continuous sequences with that sum.
4. Count the number of successful partitions, ensuring the first piece is not included in these sequences.

Let's implement this corrected approach:

```python
def calculate_ways(N, pieces):
    total_cherries = sum(pieces) - pieces[0]  # Exclude the first piece
    ways = 0

    # Find all divisors of total_cherries
    for i in range(1, int(total_cherries**0.5) + 1):
        if total_cherries % i == 0:
            # Check if it's possible to divide the cake using the divisor as the sum of pieces for friends
            for target_sum in (i, total_cherries // i):
                current_sum = 0
                valid = True
                for piece in pieces[1:]:  # Exclude the first piece
                    current_sum += piece
                    if current_sum == target_sum:
                        current_sum = 0
                    elif current_sum > target_sum:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if valid and current_sum == 0:
                    ways += 1
            if i * i == total_cherries:
                ways -= 1  # Correct for the square root being counted twice

    return ways

# Read the data
with open('tort.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    pieces = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the result
result = calculate_ways(N, pieces)

# Write the result
with open('tort.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{result}\n")
```

This code takes into account all possible sums for the sequences of friends by finding divisors of the total sum of cherries, excluding the first piece. It then checks for each divisor if the remaining pieces can be divided into sequences with that sum. The ways count is incremented only for valid partitions that exclude the first piece. Additionally, it corrects the case where the square root divisor is counted twice.

This solution should now correctly output the expected result for the given input.
