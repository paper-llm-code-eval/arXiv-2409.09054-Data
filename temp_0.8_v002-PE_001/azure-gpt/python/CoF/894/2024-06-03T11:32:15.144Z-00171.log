Se consideră răsturnatul unui număr natural valoarea obținută prin parcurgerea cifrelor acestuia de la dreapta la stânga. De exemplu, răsturnatul numărului $245$ este $542$. Un număr este palindrom dacă este egal cu răsturnatul său. De exemplu $121$ este palindrom, iar numărul $21$ nu este palindrom.

Se consideră **inițial șirul** numerelor naturale $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$

Din acest șir se elimină numerele divizibile cu $10$ și, după fiecare număr care **NU** este palindrom, se inserează răsturnatul său. **Noul șir** astfel obținut va fi $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 21, 13, 31, \dots$

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să citească:

1. un număr natural $n$ și să afișeze al $n$-lea număr eliminat din șirul inițial;
2. un număr natural $x$ și să afișeze următoarele trei numere: $n_1$ – numărul de apariții în noul șir ale numărului obținut din $x$ prin eliminarea ultimei sale cifre; $n_2$ – numărul de apariții în noul șir ale numărului obținut din $x$ prin eliminarea ultimelor sale două cifre; $n_3$ – numărul de apariții în noul șir ale numărului obținut din $x$ prin eliminarea ultimelor sale trei cifre.
3. un număr natural $k$ și să afișeze numărul valorilor de $k$ cifre din noul șir.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `numere.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$, care poate fi $1, 2$ sau $3$.
Pe linia a doua se găsește numărul natural $n$, dacă $C=1$, sau numărul natural $x$, dacă $C=2$ sau numărul natural $k$, dacă $C=3$, numerele având semnificația din enunț.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $1$, se va rezolva numai cerința $1$. În acest caz, în fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` se va scrie al $n$-lea număr eliminat.
Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $2$, se va rezolva numai cerința $2$. În acest caz, în fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` se vor scrie trei numere, $n_1, n_2, n_3$, cu semnificația din enunț, în această ordine, separate prin câte spațiu.
Dacă valoarea lui $C$ este $3$, se va rezolva numai cerința $3$. În acest caz, fișierul de ieșire `numere.out` va conține numărul valorilor de $k$ cifre din noul șir.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def n_removed(n):
    return n + (n - 1) // 9

def count_appearances(x):

    multiplier = 1
    # Calculate the number of appearances for each truncated version of x.
    for i in range(3):
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        if not is_palindrome(current):
            appearances[i] += multiplier
        multiplier *= 2
    return appearances[::-1]  # Reverse to match the order n1, n2, n3

def k_digits_count(k):
    # Count the numbers with k digits in the new sequence.
    if k == 1:
        return 9  # 1 to 9
    count = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1))
    count -= (10 ** (k - 1)) // 10  # Remove numbers divisible by 10
    # Every non-palindrome number contributes twice to the count.
    non_palindrome_count = count - sum(1 for i in range(1, 10 ** k) if is_palindrome(i))
    return count + non_palindrome_count

# Read the input
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    C = int(lines[0].strip())
    value = int(lines[1].strip())

# Process the input based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    result = n_removed(value)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_appearances(value)
elif C == 3:
    result = k_digits_count(value)

# Write the output
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 2:
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, result)) + '\n')
    else:
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution tries to work efficiently without creating large lists or arrays that could potentially exhaust the memory limit. However, the function `k_digits_count` could be optimized further for large values of `k` by avoiding the loop and using a formula to calculate the number of palindromes of `k` digits, which I didn't include here due to its complexity.

The error message indicates that the numpy module is not available. Since we cannot use external libraries (as numpy) due to the environment limitations and since the memory constraint is also tight, we will need to avoid using numpy and write the solution using only the standard library.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def n_removed(n):
    return n + (n - 1) // 9

def count_appearances(x):
    appearances = [0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(3):
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        if not is_palindrome(current):
            appearances[2 - i] += 1
        appearances[2 - i] *= 2
    appearances[0] //= 2
    appearances[1] //= 2
    appearances[2] //= 2
    return appearances

def count_palindromes(k):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(k-1), 10**k):
        if is_palindrome(i) and i % 10 != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def k_digits_count(k):
    if k == 1:
        return 9  # Single-digit numbers (all are non-palindromes and non-divisible by 10)
    total_count = 9 * (10**(k-1) - 10**(k-2))  # Total minus those ending with 0
    palindrome_count = count_palindromes(k)
    return total_count + (total_count - palindrome_count)

# Read the input from file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    value = int(file.readline().strip())

# Process the input based on the value of C and write the output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        result = n_removed(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
    elif C == 2:
        n1, n2, n3 = count_appearances(value)
        file.write(f'{n1} {n2} {n3}\n')
    elif C == 3:
        result = k_digits_count(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This revised solution doesn't use `numpy` and respects the memory limit by avoiding the creation of large data structures. The `count_palindromes` function is necessary to compute the number of palindromes of `k` digits, which are not duplicated in the new sequence. Please note that the functions for palindrome checking and the main logic have been adjusted to use only standard Python libraries.

The issue appears to be with the logic in the `n_removed` function. The function is intended to return the nth number eliminated from the initial sequence, which should be the nth multiple of 10. However, the calculation used in the function is incorrect.

Let's correct this. The nth number removed (which is divisible by 10) can be calculated as `n * 10`, because for every 10 numbers, one number (the one that is divisible by 10) is removed.

Here is the revised `n_removed` function and the full updated solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def n_removed(n):
    # The nth number removed is simply the nth multiple of 10.
    return n * 10

def count_appearances(x):
    appearances = [0, 0, 0]
    factor = 1  # To count the number of times the removal happens, which doubles each time
    for i in range(3):
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        if not is_palindrome(current) and current % 10 != 0:
            appearances[2 - i] += factor
        factor *= 2  # Each non-palindrome (except those ending with 0) is followed by its reverse
    return appearances

def k_digits_count(k):
    # For 1-digit numbers, there are 9 possibilities (1 through 9)
    if k == 1:
        return 9  
    # Calculate the count of k-digit numbers considering that numbers ending
    # with 0 are not included and each non-palindrome number is doubled
    total_count = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1))
    count_ending_with_zero = 10 ** (k - 2)
    non_palindrome_count = sum(1 for i in range(10**(k-1), 10**k) if not is_palindrome(i) and i % 10 != 0)
    return total_count - count_ending_with_zero + non_palindrome_count

# Read the input from file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    value = int(file.readline().strip())

# Process the input based on the value of C and write the output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        result = n_removed(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
    elif C == 2:
        n1, n2, n3 = count_appearances(value)
        file.write(f'{n1} {n2} {n3}\n')
    elif C == 3:
        result = k_digits_count(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should produce the correct result for `C = 1` as it now correctly multiplies `n` by 10 to determine the nth number that is removed. The other functions (`count_appearances` and `k_digits_count`) work under the assumption that the sequence is built without considering numbers divisible by 10, and that after each non-palindrome number (that is not divisible by 10), its reverse is inserted in the sequence.

The error in the previous solution is in the `n_removed` function. The logic for calculating the nth removed number is incorrect. The nth number eliminated is not `n * 10`, because as numbers are eliminated, the positions of subsequent eliminations shift.

To calculate the nth eliminated number correctly, we must consider that the numbers ending in 0 are removed, and thus, for every 10 numbers, one is removed. The nth number eliminated would be the nth number that ends with a 0. Since we start counting from 0, the correct formula would be `(n - 1) * 10`.

Let's fix the code with the correct logic for `n_removed` function:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def n_removed(n):
    # The nth number removed is the (n-1)th number ending with 0
    return (n - 1) * 10

def count_appearances(x):
    appearances = [0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(3):
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        if not is_palindrome(current) and current % 10 != 0:
            appearances[2 - i] += 1
    # Each non-palindrome number except those ending with 0 is followed by its reverse
    return [2 * n for n in appearances]

def k_digits_count(k):
    if k == 1:
        return 9  # Single-digit numbers (all are non-palindromes and non-divisible by 10)
    # Calculate the count of k-digit numbers not ending with 0 and double non-palindromes
    non_zeros = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1)) - (10 ** (k - 2))
    non_palindromes = sum(1 for i in range(10**(k-1), 10**k) if not is_palindrome(i) and i % 10 != 0)
    return non_zeros + non_palindromes

# Read the input from file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    value = int(file.readline().strip())

# Process the input based on the value of C and write the output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        result = n_removed(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
    elif C == 2:
        n1, n2, n3 = count_appearances(value)
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, n1, n2, n3)) + '\n')
    elif C == 3:
        result = k_digits_count(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

The `n_removed` function now reflects the correct calculation for the nth number eliminated, which should match the expected output. This solution should now work correctly for the given example with `C = 1` and `n = 2`. The other parts of the solution remain the same as they correctly handle the input for when `C` is 2 and 3.

The error is due to the incorrect usage of the `map` function when trying to join `n1, n2, n3`. These are integers, not iterables, so we cannot pass them directly to `map`. Instead, we need to create a tuple or a list with these values and then map `str` over that collection.

Here's the corrected code block for writing the output when `C == 2`:

```python
...
# Process the input based on the value of C and write the output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        result = n_removed(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
    elif C == 2:
        n1, n2, n3 = count_appearances(value)
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, [n1, n2, n3])) + '\n')
    elif C == 3:
        result = k_digits_count(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

By wrapping `n1, n2, n3` in a list, we create an iterable that `map` can iterate over, converting each integer to a string which can then be joined with spaces. The complete and corrected solution is as follows:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def n_removed(n):
    # The nth number removed is the (n-1)th number ending with 0
    return (n - 1) * 10

def count_appearances(x):
    appearances = [0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(3):
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        if not is_palindrome(current) and current % 10 != 0:
            appearances[2 - i] += 1
    # Each non-palindrome number except those ending with 0 is followed by its reverse
    return [2 * n for n in appearances]

def k_digits_count(k):
    if k == 1:
        return 9  # Single-digit numbers (all are non-palindromes and non-divisible by 10)
    # Calculate the count of k-digit numbers not ending with 0 and double non-palindromes
    non_zeros = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1)) - (10 ** (k - 2))
    non_palindromes = sum(1 for i in range(10**(k-1), 10**k) if not is_palindrome(i) and i % 10 != 0)
    return non_zeros + non_palindromes

# Read the input from file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    value = int(file.readline().strip())

# Process the input based on the value of C and write the output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        result = n_removed(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
    elif C == 2:
        n1, n2, n3 = count_appearances(value)
        file.write(' '.join(map(str, [n1, n2, n3])) + '\n')
    elif C == 3:
        result = k_digits_count(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This corrected version should not produce any errors and should provide the correct output for all cases of `C`.

The discrepancy in the expected and found output for `C=2` indicates that the logic used to count the appearances (`count_appearances`) of truncated versions of `x` in the modified sequence is flawed. The function should be checking how many times each truncated version of `x` would appear in the new sequence. However, we must account for the fact that the appearance of each truncated version is not simply twice the previous one due to the presence of palindromes and numbers divisible by 10 which are not followed by their reverse.

To fix the `count_appearances` function, we need to revise the logic to properly account for the structure of the new sequence where numbers that are palindromes or divisible by 10 are not followed by their reverse. We also need to handle the lower truncated values by considering the entire range up to `x`.

Let's re-implement the `count_appearances` function:

```python
def count_appearances(x):
    appearances = [0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(3):
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        if current % 10 == 0 or is_palindrome(current):
            # If the number is divisible by 10 or is a palindrome, we don't increment the count
            continue
        else:
            # If the number is not divisible by 10 and not a palindrome,
            # it's followed by its reverse, so we increment the count
            appearances[i] += 1
    return appearances[::-1]  # Reverse to match the order n1, n2, n3

# The rest of the program remains the same.

# Here's the corrected and complete solution:

def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def n_removed(n):
    return (n - 1) * 10

def count_appearances(x):
    appearances = [0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(3):
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        if current % 10 == 0 or is_palindrome(current):
            continue
        else:
            appearances[i] += 1
    return appearances[::-1]

def k_digits_count(k):
    if k == 1:
        return 9
    count = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1))
    for num in range(10 ** (k - 1), 10 ** k):
        if num % 10 != 0:
            if not is_palindrome(num):
                count += 1
    return count

# Read the input from file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    value = int(file.readline().strip())

# Process the input based on the value of C and write the output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        result = n_removed(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
    elif C == 2:
        n1, n2, n3 = count_appearances(value)
        file.write(f'{n1} {n2} {n3}\n')
    elif C == 3:
        result = k_digits_count(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This solution should now correctly count the appearances of each truncated version of `x` in the sequence, considering the special cases for numbers ending in 0 and palindromes.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that the logic in the `count_appearances` function is incorrect. Specifically, the function is not accounting for the pattern of numbers in the new sequence correctly.

The `count_appearances` function should work as follows:

- For `n1`, it should count how many times the number obtained from `x` by removing the last digit appears in the sequence. Since this is the original number without its last digit, it should appear once, unless it is a palindrome or ends with a zero.
- For `n2`, it should count how many times the number obtained from `x` by removing the last two digits appears. This number appears once for each non-palindrome, non-zero-ending number less than it.
- For `n3`, it should count how many times the number obtained from `x` by removing the last three digits appears. This number appears once for each non-palindrome, non-zero-ending number less than it.

Here's how to handle these cases:

- If the truncated number `current` is a palindrome or it ends with zero, it will not be doubled in the sequence.
- If `current` is not a palindrome and does not end with zero, it will be doubled except for the last set of digits from 1 to 9 (since numbers from 1 to 9 are not doubled in the sequence).

Let's implement these corrections:

```python
def count_appearances(x):
    # Initialize the counts for n1, n2, n3
    n1 = n2 = n3 = 0
    # Initialize the multiplier, which will be used to count the appearances
    multiplier = 1
    # Loop through each truncation level
    for i in range(3):
        # Truncate the number
        current = x // (10 ** i)
        # Check for palindrome and ending with zero
        if current % 10 != 0 and not is_palindrome(current):
            # If it's neither, increment the count
            n1 += multiplier
        # Increase the multiplier for the next truncation level, unless it's the last digit
        if i < 2:
            multiplier *= 2
    # n2 and n3 are calculated based on n1 and the multipliers
    n2 = n1 // 2
    n3 = n2 // 2
    return n1, n2, n3

# The rest of the program remains unchanged.

# Here's the corrected and complete solution:

def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def n_removed(n):
    return (n - 1) * 10

def k_digits_count(k):
    if k == 1:
        return 9
    count = 9 * (10 ** (k - 1))
    for num in range(10 ** (k - 1), 10 ** k):
        if num % 10 != 0:
            if not is_palindrome(num):
                count += 1
    return count

# Read the input from file
with open('numere.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    value = int(file.readline().strip())

# Process the input based on the value of C and write the output to file
with open('numere.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        result = n_removed(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
    elif C == 2:
        n1, n2, n3 = count_appearances(value)
        file.write(f'{n1} {n2} {n3}\n')
    elif C == 3:
        result = k_digits_count(value)
        file.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This corrected solution takes into account the special cases for palindromes and numbers ending with zero when counting appearances after truncating digits from `x`. It should now provide the correct output for `C=2` and the given input `1205`.
