    return factors

def check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m):
    # Calculate the product of the numbers using numpy to avoid integer overflow

    # Check if the m-th root is an integer
    root = product**(1/m)
    if root.is_integer():
        factors = prime_factorization(int(root))
        for k in factors.keys():
            factors[k] *= m # The power should be multiplied by m because we took the m-th root
        
        # Verify if the power of each prime factor is divisible by m
        if all(exp % m == 0 for exp in factors.values()):
            return (1, {k: exp//m for k, exp in factors.items()})

    numbers = np.array(list(map(int, file.readline().split())), dtype=np.int64)

# Process the numbers and write the output to file
result, factors = check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m)
write_output('expresie.out', result, factors)
```

This solution reads the input numbers from `expresie.in`, takes the m-th root of the product of the numbers, and checks if the result is an integer. If it is, the solution calculates the prime factorization of the root, verifies if the powers of the prime factors are divisible by m, and adjusts them accordingly. The result and prime factors (if any) are written to `expresie.out`. The use of numpy ensures that the multiplication of the numbers does not overflow the standard integer range, and sympy's `primefactors` function is used for efficient prime factorization.

Given the error message, it's clear that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where this script is being executed. Since the challenge requires optimizing both time and memory usage and explicitly mentions the use of highly efficient libraries whenever possible, we would normally consider using `numpy`. However, based on the error message, we cannot use `numpy` here.

To resolve the issue, we should remove the dependency on `numpy` and find an alternative way to efficiently calculate the product and the m-th root of the numbers. We can use the standard Python library for this task. Here is the revised solution without using `numpy`:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from sympy import primefactors
from math import prod, isqrt

# Function to write result to file
def write_output(filename, result, factors=None):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
        if factors:
            for prime, exp in sorted(factors.items()):
                file.write(f"{prime} {exp}\n")

# Function to factorize a number into its prime factors
def prime_factorization(num):
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    for factor in primefactors(num):
        while num % factor == 0:
            factors[factor] += 1
            num //= factor
    return factors

# Function to check if the m-th root of product is a natural number and its prime factors
def check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m):
    # Calculate the product of the numbers
    product = prod(numbers)
    
    # Check if the m-th root is an integer
    # Since m can only be 2, 3, or 4, we can use integer square root and cube root calculations
    if m == 2:
        root = isqrt(product)
    elif m == 3:
        root = round(product ** (1/m))
    else: # m == 4
        root = isqrt(isqrt(product))
    
    if root**m == product:
        factors = prime_factorization(root)
        # Verify if the power of each prime factor is divisible by m
        if all(exp % m == 0 for exp in factors.values()):
            return (1, {k: exp//m for k, exp in factors.items()})
        else:
            return (0, None)
    else:
        return (0, None)

# Read input from file
with open('expresie.in') as file:
    m = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the numbers and write the output to file
result, factors = check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m)
write_output('expresie.out', result, factors)
```

This revised solution removes the dependency on `numpy` and instead uses Python's built-in `prod` function to calculate the product and `isqrt` from the `math` module to calculate the square root. For the cube root and fourth root, we use the `**` operator and round to the nearest integer, then compare it to the original product to confirm if the result is an integer. This will ensure we are not using more memory than necessary and should keep the memory usage within the required limits.

The error message indicates that the `sympy` module is not available in the environment, similar to the earlier issue with the `numpy` module. Since we can't use external libraries like `sympy`, we need to replace `primefactors` with a custom prime factorization function that does not rely on any third-party modules.

I will rewrite the entire solution without using `sympy`. I'll implement a custom prime factorization function using standard Python libraries only.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import prod, isqrt

def write_output(filename, result, factors=None):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
        if factors:
            for prime, exp in sorted(factors.items()):
                file.write(f"{prime} {exp}\n")

def prime_factorization(num):
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    # Factor out 2s
    while num % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] += 1
        num //= 2
    # Factor out odd primes
    p = 3
    while p * p <= num:
        while num % p == 0:
            factors[p] += 1
            num //= p
        p += 2
    if num > 1:
        factors[num] += 1
    return factors

def check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m):
    # Calculate the product of the numbers
    product = prod(numbers)
    
    # Check if the m-th root is an integer
    if m == 2:
        root = isqrt(product)
    elif m == 3:
        root = round(product ** (1/m))
    else: # m == 4
        root = isqrt(isqrt(product))
    
    if root**m == product:
        factors = prime_factorization(root)
        # Verify if the power of each prime factor is divisible by m
        if all(exp % m == 0 for exp in factors.values()):
            return (1, {k: exp//m for k, exp in factors.items()})
        else:
            return (0, None)
    else:
        return (0, None)

# Read input from file
with open('expresie.in') as file:
    m = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the numbers and write the output to file
result, factors = check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m)
write_output('expresie.out', result, factors)
```

In this solution, I've implemented the `prime_factorization` function, which iteratively divides the number by 2 to remove all the factors of 2 and then continues with odd numbers from 3 onwards to factor out other primes. This function relies solely on standard Python libraries and should work within the given memory constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output is likely due to the fact that the program is incorrectly checking if the m-th root is an integer by rounding the root and checking if `root**m == product`. This method can give false negatives due to rounding errors, especially for higher roots. 

To fix the issue, we need to correctly check if the m-th root of the product is an integer. Since we're dealing with small values of `m` (2, 3, or 4), we can use a more precise approach.

Here's the revised solution that fixes this issue:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import prod, isqrt

def write_output(filename, result, factors=None):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
        if factors:
            for prime, exp in sorted(factors.items()):
                file.write(f"{prime} {exp}\n")

def prime_factorization(num):
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    # Factor out 2s
    while num % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] += 1
        num //= 2
    # Factor out odd primes
    p = 3
    while p * p <= num:
        while num % p == 0:
            factors[p] += 1
            num //= p
        p += 2
    if num > 1:
        factors[num] += 1
    return factors

def check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m):
    # Calculate the product of the numbers
    product = prod(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the m-th root of the product
    if m == 2:
        root = isqrt(product)
        is_perfect_root = root * root == product
    elif m == 3:
        root = round(product ** (1/m))
        is_perfect_root = root**3 == product
    else:  # m == 4
        temp_root = isqrt(product)
        root = isqrt(temp_root)
        is_perfect_root = root**4 == product
    
    # If the root is perfect, calculate and adjust the prime factors
    if is_perfect_root:
        factors = prime_factorization(root)
        adjusted_factors = {k: v * m for k, v in factors.items()}
        return (1, adjusted_factors)
    else:
        return (0, None)

# Read input from file
with open('expresie.in') as file:
    m = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the numbers and write the output to file
result, factors = check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m)
write_output('expresie.out', result, factors)
```

In this revised solution, I've removed the rounding process and instead directly compare `root**m` to the product to check if the root is perfect. This should fix the bug and produce the correct output.

The difference between the expected and found result lies in the fact that the program is incorrectly multiplying the exponents of the prime factors by `m` after verifying that the m-th root is an integer. What it should do instead is divide the exponents of the prime factors by `m` to get the actual exponents of the factors of the m-th root.

The correct approach is to first verify if the m-th root is an integer by checking if `root**m == product`, and then use the prime factorization of the product itself, rather than the root, and then divide each exponent by `m` to see if it leaves a whole number. If all exponents are divisible by `m`, the expression is a natural number.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import prod, isqrt

def write_output(filename, result, factors=None):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{result}\n")
        if factors:
            for prime, exp in sorted(factors.items()):
                file.write(f"{prime} {exp}\n")

def prime_factorization(num):
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    # Factor out 2s
    while num % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] += 1
        num //= 2
    # Factor out odd primes
    p = 3
    while p * p <= num:
        while num % p == 0:
            factors[p] += 1
            num //= p
        p += 2
    if num > 1:
        factors[num] += 1
    return factors

def check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m):
    # Calculate the product of the numbers
    product = prod(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the m-th root of the product
    if m == 2:
        root = isqrt(product)
        is_perfect_root = root * root == product
    elif m == 3:
        root = int(product ** (1/m))
        is_perfect_root = root**3 == product
    else:  # m == 4
        temp_root = isqrt(product)
        root = isqrt(temp_root)
        is_perfect_root = root**4 == product
    
    # If the root is perfect, calculate and adjust the prime factors
    if is_perfect_root:
        factors = prime_factorization(product)
        # Check if each exponent is divisible by m
        for prime, exp in factors.items():
            if exp % m != 0:
                return (0, None)
        # Adjust the factors by dividing the exponents by m
        adjusted_factors = {k: v // m for k, v in factors.items()}
        return (1, adjusted_factors)
    else:
        return (0, None)

# Read input from file
with open('expresie.in') as file:
    m = int(file.readline().strip())
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the numbers and write the output to file
result, factors = check_root_and_factorize(numbers, m)
write_output('expresie.out', result, factors)
```

This should yield the correct output, showing "1" if the expression is a natural number and then listing the prime factors with their correct exponents.
