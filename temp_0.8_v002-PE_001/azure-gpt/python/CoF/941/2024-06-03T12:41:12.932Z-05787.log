Un atelier de fabricat ceasuri cu cuc are nevoie de plăcuțe cu numerele pentru orele pe care trebuie să le așeze pe discul ceasurilor. Aceste numere sunt realizate la o imprimantă.

Din cauza unei erori imprimanta tipărește plăcuțe cu numere naturale, unele mai mari ca $12$. Atelierul poate utiliza doar plăcuțe cu numere cuprinse ı̂ntre $0$ și $12$. Pentru a utiliza aceste numere este nevoie ca ele să fie tăiate ı̂ncepând din partea dreaptă ı̂n grupuri de maximum două cifre, fiecare grup reprezentând valoarea de pe o plăcuță, care să fie o cifră la $0$ la $9$ sau unul dintre numerele $10$, $11$, $12$. Dacă pe o plăcuță se găsește un număr mai mare ca $12$ atunci plăcuța trebuie tăiată, astfel ı̂ncât ı̂n urma tăierii să se obțină numere de cel mult $2$ cifre. Dacă ı̂n numărul de pe o plăcuță cifra zecilor este $0$, atunci la prima tăiere se ia doar cifra unităților, altfel dacă numărul format cu cifra zecilor și unităților este mai mare ca $12$, atunci se taie prima dată cifra unităților, iar dacă numărul format cu cifra zecilor și unităților este $10$, $11$ sau $12$ se taie prima dată numărul format din ultimele două cifre, apoi procedeul se repetă până la tăierea completă a plăcuței. Imprimanta a realizat N plăcuțe. De exemplu dacă plăcuța este $12030$, după tăiere se obțin $0$, $3$, $0$, $12$.

# Cerință
1. Determinați numărul total de apariții ale cifrei $X$ pe plăcuțe ı̂nainte de tăiere.
2. Determinați numărul de tăieturi realizate conform enunțului.

# Date de intrare

Pe prima linie a fișierului `ceas.in` se află valorile $C$, $X$ și $N$ separate prin câte un singur spațiu. Pe linia a doua se află $N$ numere naturale separate prin câte un singur spațiu, având semnificația din enunț. Pentru $C = 1$ se rezolvă doar cerința $1$, iar pentru $C = 2$ se rezolvă doar cerința $2$.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul `ceas.out` conține pe prima linie un singur număr natural care reprezintă valoarea calculată conform cerinței.

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $0 \leq X \leq 9$;
* Valorile din șir sunt numere naturale $\leq 50 \ 000$;
* Pentru testele în care avem $C = 2$ valoarea $X$ este prezentă în fișierul de intrare chiar dacă nu este folosită în rezolvare.
* Pentru teste în valoare de $39$ de puncte avem $C = 1$
* Pentru teste în valoare de $61$ de puncte avem $C = 2$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Below is the Python solution to the challenge. The solution is designed to work efficiently with memory and time constraints.

```python
import numpy as np

def count_appearances(numbers, digit):
    appearances = str(numbers).count(str(digit))
    return appearances

def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        while num > 0:
            if num % 100 <= 12:
                num //= 100
            else:
                num //= 10
            cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Read from 'ceas.in'
with open('ceas.in', 'rt') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    numbers = np.array(file.readline().split(), dtype=int)

# Process the data based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    result = count_appearances(numbers, X)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_cuts(numbers)

# Write the result to 'ceas.out'
with open('ceas.out', 'wt') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution reads data from the file `ceas.in`, and writes the output to `ceas.out` as specified. It uses numpy to store the numbers read from the file efficiently and conducts the required operations based on the value of `C`. It does not use `input()` or `print()`. Please ensure that numpy is installed if you run this code.

The exit code indicates that the `numpy` module is not installed or not found. Since the requirement specifies that we should use highly efficient libraries and optimize both time and memory usage, I had initially opted to use `numpy`.

However, due to the environment restrictions, it looks like we cannot use external libraries. We need to remove the dependency on `numpy` and implement the solution using only the Python Standard Library, which should also help with memory constraints as we won't be loading the entire `numpy` library.

Below is the revised solution without the use of `numpy`:

```python
def count_appearances(numbers, digit):
    appearances = sum(str(num).count(str(digit)) for num in numbers)
    return appearances

def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        while num > 0:
            if num % 100 <= 12:
                num //= 100
            else:
                num //= 10
            cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Read from 'ceas.in'
with open('ceas.in', 'rt') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data based on the value of C
if C == 1:
    result = count_appearances(numbers, X)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_cuts(numbers)

# Write the result to 'ceas.out'
with open('ceas.out', 'wt') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This solution uses only built-in functions and constructs, and should work within the memory constraints, as it processes one number at a time and doesn't store unnecessary data in memory.

The issue with the previous code lies in the cutting logic within the `count_cuts` function. According to the problem statement, a cut can only be made if the resulting number is between 0 and 12, inclusive. The previous code does not consider the case where the leading digit after a cut would be 0, which should not count as a separate cut since we should take only the unit digit in such cases.

We need to modify the cutting logic to account for these rules. Here's the updated `count_cuts` function:

```python
def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        while num > 0:
            # If leading digit is 0 or the last two digits form a number between 1 and 12, cut the last two digits.
            if (num % 100 <= 12 and num % 100 > 0) or (num % 10 == 0):
                num //= 100
            else:  # Otherwise, cut only the last digit.
                num //= 10
            cuts += 1
    return cuts
```

Let's rewrite the entire solution with the necessary fix:

```python
def count_appearances(numbers, digit):
    appearances = sum(str(num).count(str(digit)) for num in numbers)
    return appearances

def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        while num > 0:
            # If leading digit is 0 or the last two digits form a number between 1 and 12, cut the last two digits.
            if (num % 100 <= 12 and num % 100 > 0) or (num % 10 == 0):
                num //= 100
            else:  # Otherwise, cut only the last digit.
                num //= 10
            cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Read from 'ceas.in'
with open('ceas.in', 'rt') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data based on the value of C
result = None
if C == 1:
    result = count_appearances(numbers, X)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_cuts(numbers)

# Write the result to 'ceas.out'
with open('ceas.out', 'wt') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This updated solution should now provide the correct number of cuts for the given input data.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result arises from an incorrect implementation of the cutting logic in the `count_cuts` function. The previous solution did not correctly handle cutting cases when the tens place is 0 and the number is greater than 12. 

When the tens place is 0 and the number is greater than 12, we must cut only the unit's place. Moreover, if the last two digits form a number greater than 12, we again cut only the unit's place. The algorithm must also consider that we should not cut when we reach a single-digit number because that would be a valid number for the clock.

Let's correct the `count_cuts` function:

```python
def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        # Convert number to string for easier manipulation
        num_str = str(num)
        while len(num_str) > 2 or (len(num_str) == 2 and int(num_str) > 12):
            # Check if the last two digits form a valid number for the clock
            if 0 < int(num_str[-2:]) <= 12:
                num_str = num_str[:-2]  # Cut the last two digits
            else:
                num_str = num_str[:-1]  # Cut the last digit
            cuts += 1
        # One additional cut if the remaining number is greater than 12
        if len(num_str) == 2 and int(num_str) > 12:
            cuts += 1
    return cuts
```

Now let's rewrite the entire solution with the fixed `count_cuts` function:

```python
def count_appearances(numbers, digit):
    appearances = sum(str(num).count(str(digit)) for num in numbers)
    return appearances

def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        # Convert number to string for easier manipulation
        num_str = str(num)
        while len(num_str) > 2 or (len(num_str) == 2 and int(num_str) > 12):
            # Check if the last two digits form a valid number for the clock
            if 0 < int(num_str[-2:]) <= 12:
                num_str = num_str[:-2]  # Cut the last two digits
            else:
                num_str = num_str[:-1]  # Cut the last digit
            cuts += 1
        # One additional cut if the remaining number is greater than 12
        if len(num_str) == 2 and int(num_str) > 12:
            cuts += 1
    return cuts

# Read from 'ceas.in'
with open('ceas.in', 'rt') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data based on the value of C
result = None
if C == 1:
    result = count_appearances(numbers, X)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_cuts(numbers)

# Write the result to 'ceas.out'
with open('ceas.out', 'wt') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This updated solution should handle all cases correctly and output the expected result.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to an error in the `count_cuts` function logic. It seems that the check for additional cuts is not correctly handling all cases. Specifically, the check for when the length of `num_str` is 2 and greater than 12 is not needed since these cases are already covered by the while loop.

Let's correct the logic to ensure that we handle the leading 0 cases correctly. If the tens digit is 0 while the number is greater than 100, we should only take the unit digit and not count the 0 as a cut. If the number formed by the last two digits is greater than 12, we should also only take the last digit. Otherwise, if the number is less than or equal to 12, we can take the last two digits as a cut.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        num_str = str(num)
        while len(num_str) > 1:  # There is something to cut
            if len(num_str) == 2 and int(num_str) <= 12 or num_str[0] == '0':
                # If the number is valid or starts with 0, take the whole number or the last digit
                num_str = ''
            elif int(num_str[-2:]) > 12 or num_str[-2] == '0':
                # If the last two digits form a number greater than 12 or if tens is 0, take the last digit
                num_str = num_str[:-1]
            else:
                # Otherwise, take the last two digits
                num_str = num_str[:-2]
            cuts += 1
        # If there's one digit left that is not 0, it's a valid number, so no cut needed
    return cuts

# Read from 'ceas.in'
with open('ceas.in', 'rt') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data based on the value of C
result = None
if C == 1:
    result = count_appearances(numbers, X)  # Function definition unchanged, omitted for brevity
elif C == 2:
    result = count_cuts(numbers)

# Write the result to 'ceas.out'
with open('ceas.out', 'wt') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This code now accurately reflects the cutting logic described in the problem statement and should yield the correct number of cuts for the input data provided.

The issue is that the function `count_appearances` is being called, but its definition is not included in the code provided. This results in a `NameError` because Python cannot find the definition of `count_appearances`.

To fix this, we need to either define the `count_appearances` function if it's needed (which it is when `C == 1`) or remove the call to it if it isn't. Since the function is needed according to the problem statement, let's define it:

Let's redefine the `count_appearances` function and then provide the complete corrected solution:

```python
def count_appearances(numbers, digit):
    appearances = sum(str(num).count(str(digit)) for num in numbers)
    return appearances

def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        num_str = str(num)
        while len(num_str) > 1:  # There is something to cut
            if len(num_str) > 2 or (len(num_str) == 2 and int(num_str) > 12):
                # Cut the last digit if the number is not valid
                num_str = num_str[:-1]
                cuts += 1
            elif len(num_str) == 2 and int(num_str) <= 12:
                # If the last two digits form a valid number, cut them both
                break  # No more cuts needed
        if len(num_str) == 1 and int(num_str) <= 12:
            # If there's one digit left that is a valid number, so no cut needed
            pass
    return cuts

# Read from 'ceas.in'
with open('ceas.in', 'rt') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data based on the value of C
result = None
if C == 1:
    result = count_appearances(numbers, X)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_cuts(numbers)

# Write the result to 'ceas.out'
with open('ceas.out', 'wt') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

Now, with the `count_appearances` function defined, the program should no longer exit with a `NameError`, and it should correctly handle both parts of the problem statement. It reads the input from `ceas.in`, processes the data according to the value of `C`, and writes the output to `ceas.out`.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is again due to an error in the `count_cuts` function logic. We need to ensure that we correctly apply the cutting rules as described in the problem statement. Also, we should ensure that we're not cutting any single digit, as it's already a valid number for the clock. 

The rule is that we should cut from the rightmost digit, and each group cut should result in a number between 0 and 12. We should cut one digit when the rightmost digit is standalone, or we can cut two digits if they form a number between 10 and 12. If the rightmost two digits form a number greater than 12, we should only cut the rightmost digit. 

Let's rewrite the `count_cuts` function with the correct logic:

```python
def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        while num > 12:  # As long as the number is greater than 12, we need to make cuts.
            if num % 100 <= 12 and num % 100 >= 10:
                num //= 100  # If the last two digits are between 10 and 12, cut them both.
            else:
                num //= 10  # Otherwise, cut only the last digit.
            cuts += 1  # Each cut operation increments the counter.
    return cuts
```

Now let's provide the complete corrected solution including the `count_appearances` and `count_cuts` functions:

```python
def count_appearances(numbers, digit):
    appearances = sum(str(num).count(str(digit)) for num in numbers)
    return appearances

def count_cuts(numbers):
    cuts = 0
    for num in numbers:
        while num > 12:  # As long as the number is greater than 12, we need to make cuts.
            if num % 100 <= 12 and num % 100 >= 10:
                num //= 100  # If the last two digits are between 10 and 12, cut them both.
            else:
                num //= 10  # Otherwise, cut only the last digit.
            cuts += 1  # Each cut operation increments the counter.
    return cuts

# Read from 'ceas.in'
with open('ceas.in', 'rt') as file:
    C, X, N = map(int, file.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data based on the value of C
result = None
if C == 1:
    result = count_appearances(numbers, X)
elif C == 2:
    result = count_cuts(numbers)

# Write the result to 'ceas.out'
with open('ceas.out', 'wt') as file:
    file.write(str(result))
```

This updated solution should now accurately calculate the number of cuts required for each number on the clock's disc, according to the rules provided in the problem statement.
