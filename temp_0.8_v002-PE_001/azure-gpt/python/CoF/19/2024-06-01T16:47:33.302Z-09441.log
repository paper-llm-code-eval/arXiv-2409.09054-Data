Se dă un șir de `N` numere întregi notat cu `A`. O *subsecvență* a șirului `A` este un șir $A_i A_{i+1} A_{i+2} … A_j$ cu `1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N`, iar lungimea acestei subsecvențe este egală cu `j – i + 1`. O *operație* constă în alegerea unei subsecvențe din șir și ștergerea acesteia. În cadrul unei operații, **lungimea subsecvenței alese trebuie să fie o putere de`2`**. În cadrul tuturor operațiilor efectuate pe șir, **lungimile subsecvențelor șterse trebuie să fie distincte**.

Pentru fiecare subsecvență din șir considerăm suma elementelor ei. Definim *costul* unui șir ca fiind maximul acestor sume, în cazul în care șirul conține cel puțin un număr pozitiv, altfel costul șirului este egal cu `0`.

Putem aplica o succesiune de operații (eventual niciuna) pe șirul `A`. În urma acestor operații se vor șterge anumite elemente din șir, obținându-se astfel o mulțime de șiruri $M=\{A, A’_1, A’_2, A’_3, ...\}$.

# Cerinţă

Since the error message indicates that `numpy` is not installed and we are constrained by the memory limit, I will rewrite the solution without using the `numpy` library, relying instead on standard Python data structures and functions to ensure the code can execute in an environment without `numpy` or other third-party libraries.

```python
def max_subarray_sum(A):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for a in A:
        current_sum = max(a, current_sum + a)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def calculate_max_cost(N, A):
    # Base case: if all numbers are non-positive, the cost is 0.
    if all(a <= 0 for a in A):
        return 0
    
    max_cost = max_subarray_sum(A)
    # Find powers of 2 less than or equal to N
    powers = [2**i for i in range(N.bit_length()) if 2**i <= N]

    for power in reversed(powers):
        for start in range(N - power + 1):
            end = start + power
            # Calculate cost if we remove the subarray of length power
            removed_sum = sum(A[start:end])
            new_A = A[:start] + A[end:]
            cost_with_removal = max_subarray_sum(new_A)
            max_cost = max(max_cost, cost_with_removal)
            if removed_sum <= 0:

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that there's a flaw in the logic of the initial solution. The solution does not correctly account for the requirement that each subsequence removed must be of a unique power of 2 length, and that the sum of the remaining elements should be maximized.

The initial solution considered removal of subsequences of different lengths for each power of 2, which is incorrect since it does not guarantee that the remaining sequence will have the maximum possible sum. 

To fix the issue, we need to implement an algorithm that finds the maximum sum of any subarray in the original array. Then, we need to iterate over all possible lengths (that are powers of 2) and find the subarray of that length which, when removed, leaves the maximum sum of the remaining elements. We need to track the maximum sum found after each removal operation to ensure we have the maximum possible cost.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the maximum subarray sum
def max_subarray_sum(A):
    max_sum = A[0]
    current_sum = A[0]
    for num in A[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

# Read input from the file
with open('recyclebin.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Initialize the max_cost to the sum of the array or 0 if all elements are negative
max_cost = max(0, max_subarray_sum(A))

# Calculate the maximum cost after removing a subarray of length power of 2
for power in range(N.bit_length()):  # Iterate over powers of 2
    length = 2 ** power
    if length > N:  # If the length exceeds the number of elements, break
        break
    for i in range(N - length + 1):  # Iterate over starting indices of subarrays
        # Sum of subarray that could be removed
        subarray_sum = sum(A[i:i+length])
        # Remaining elements after removing the subarray
        remaining_elements = A[:i] + A[i+length:]
        # Calculate the maximum sum of the remaining elements
        remaining_sum = max_subarray_sum(remaining_elements)
        # Update max_cost if the cost is higher after the removal
        max_cost = max(max_cost, remaining_sum)

# Write the output to the file
with open('recyclebin.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_cost}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, we iterate over all possible subarrays that could be removed (of lengths that are powers of 2) and then calculate the max subarray sum of the remaining array after each removal. We keep track of the maximum cost found after each removal operation.

This solution now fulfills the requirements and should produce the expected output.

The reason for the discrepancy is that the previous solutions did not correctly follow the rules for subsequence removal. Specifically, they allowed for the removal of subsequences with lengths that were not unique powers of 2, and they did not ensure that each removal operation used a distinct power of 2.

To fix this, we need to reconsider the algorithm. We must select subsequences to remove in such a way that the length of each subsequence is a unique power of 2 and maximize the sum of the remaining elements.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_sum = arr[0]
    current_sum = arr[0]
    for num in arr[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

# Function to find the maximum cost of the array after removing subsequences
def calculate_max_cost(N, A):
    # Initialize the max cost to the sum of the array or 0 if all elements are negative
    max_cost = max(0, max_subarray_sum(A))
    possible_lengths = {2**i for i in range(N.bit_length()) if 2**i <= N}
    
    # DP array to keep track of maximum sum after removing subarrays of different lengths
    dp = [0] * (N + 1)
    dp[N] = max_cost
    
    # Iterate over all subsequences of power-of-2 lengths
    for length in sorted(possible_lengths, reverse=True):
        new_dp = dp.copy()
        for i in range(N - length + 1):
            # Calculate the sum of the remaining elements after removing the subarray
            remaining_sum = dp[i + length] + sum(A[i:i + length])
            new_dp[i] = max(new_dp[i], remaining_sum)
        dp = new_dp
    
    max_cost = max(dp)
    
    return max_cost

# Read input from the file
with open('recyclebin.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum cost
max_cost = calculate_max_cost(N, A)

# Write the output to the file
with open('recyclebin.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_cost}\n")
```

This corrected solution follows the rules for subsequence removal strictly. It calculates the maximum sum of the elements that remain after each possible removal of a subsequence whose length is a unique power of 2. The algorithm uses dynamic programming (dp) to determine the maximum sum that can be achieved after removing each subsequence of a possible length. It iterates through all subsequences of power-of-2 lengths and updates the maximum sum after each removal. This should give us the expected result.

It appears that the previous solutions did not correctly implement the rule that once a subsequence of a certain power-of-2 length has been removed, no subsequences of that length can be removed again. Moreover, the algorithm must search for the subsequence of each valid power-of-2 length whose removal maximizes the sum of the remaining elements, while ensuring that these lengths are distinct.

Let's correct the solution by implementing a function that searches for the best subsequence to remove for each power-of-2 length while ensuring the maximum sum of the remaining array:

```python
def calculate_max_cost(A):
    # Initial max cost is the max subarray sum of the entire array
    max_cost = max_subarray_sum(A)

    # For each power of 2, try to remove a subsequence of that length if doing so is beneficial
    power_of_2 = 1
    while power_of_2 <= len(A):
        # Store the best cost after removing a subsequence of the current length
        best_cost_after_removal = 0
        for start in range(len(A) - power_of_2 + 1):
            # Consider the subarray before and after the removed subsequence
            before_removal = A[:start]
            after_removal = A[start + power_of_2:]
            # Calculate the max subarray sum of the combined remaining subarrays
            combined_max_sum = max_subarray_sum(before_removal + after_removal)
            # Update the best cost after removal
            best_cost_after_removal = max(best_cost_after_removal, combined_max_sum)
        # Update the overall max cost if removing this subsequence is beneficial
        max_cost = max(max_cost, best_cost_after_removal)
        power_of_2 *= 2  # Go to the next power of 2

    return max_cost

def max_subarray_sum(A):
    # Function to find the maximum subarray sum
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = A[0]
    for x in A[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

# Read input from the file
with open('recyclebin.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum cost
max_cost = calculate_max_cost(A)

# Write the output to the file
with open('recyclebin.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_cost}\n")
```

In this corrected solution, we iterate over all the possible powers of 2 that can be used as lengths of subsequences to be removed. For each power of 2, we find the best subsequence whose removal yields the highest subarray sum of the remaining elements. We keep track of the best cost after each removal and update the overall max cost accordingly. This solution should now meet the requirements and produce the expected output.

I apologize for the confusion in the previous attempts. The task requires us to consider removing subarrays of length that are powers of 2, and each of these lengths can be used only once. It is a more complex problem because we need to find the optimal sequence of removals such that the sum of the elements of the remaining array is maximized.

The key to solving this problem is understanding that the order of removals can affect the final maximum sum. We will need to consider all possible sequences of subarray removals, where each removal length is a distinct power of 2, and calculate the maximum sum that can be obtained.

Let's try a different approach that checks all possible sequences of subarray removals:

```python
# Function to find the maximum subarray sum for a given list
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

# Recursive function to find the maximum cost of the array considering
# removing subsequences of unique power-of-2 lengths
def find_max_cost(A, used_lengths, start_length=1):
    N = len(A)
    # Base case: if all numbers are non-positive, the cost is 0
    if all(x <= 0 for x in A):
        return 0
    
    max_cost = max_subarray_sum(A)
    # Try all power-of-2 lengths starting from start_length
    length = start_length
    while length <= N:
        if length not in used_lengths:
            # Try removing all subsequences of the current length
            for start in range(N - length + 1):
                # Calculate cost after removing the current subsequence
                new_A = A[:start] + A[start + length:]
                # Ensure we do not use the same length again
                new_used_lengths = used_lengths.union({length})
                # Recursively find the max cost for the new array
                cost_with_removal = find_max_cost(new_A, new_used_lengths, length * 2)
                max_cost = max(max_cost, cost_with_removal)
        length *= 2
    
    return max_cost

# Read input from the file
with open('recyclebin.in', 'r') as file:
    N = int(file.readline().strip())
    A = list(map(int, file.readline().strip().split()))

# Calculate the maximum cost
max_cost = find_max_cost(A, set())

# Write the output to the file
with open('recyclebin.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{max_cost}\n")
```

In this solution, we have a recursive function `find_max_cost` that attempts to remove all possible subsequences of unique power-of-2 lengths and calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained after each removal. We keep track of which lengths have been used to ensure that we only use each power-of-2 length once. The recursion explores all different paths of subsequence removal, calculating the sum of the remaining elements after each removal, and ultimately returns the maximum sum found.

This solution should correctly handle the complexity of the problem and produce the expected output within the memory limits.
