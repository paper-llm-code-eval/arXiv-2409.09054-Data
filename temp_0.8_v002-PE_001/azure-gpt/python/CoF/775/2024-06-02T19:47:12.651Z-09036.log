În podul casei, Andrei a găsit coperta unei cărţi vechi de-a bunicului său, şi împrăştiate prin mai multe cutii, paginile rupte din această carte. El se gândeşte că i-ar face o mare bucurie bunicului dacă ar reface cartea şi ar prinde paginile acesteia în copertă.

După ce a strâns laolaltă toate paginile găsite, Andrei îşi dă seama că acestea nu sunt puse în ordine şi o parte dintre ele s-au pierdut. Astfel, se hotărăşte să prindă împreună cu o agrafă paginile ce ar trebui aranjate una după alta în carte.

Cunoscând numărul fiecărei pagini din carte, găsite de Andrei, determinaţi care este numărul de agrafe de care are nevoie Andrei şi care este cel mai mare număr de pagini ce au fost prinse împreună cu o agrafă.

# Cerință

Să se scrie un program care să determine numărul de agrafe necesare pentru paginile cărţii şi cel mai mare număr de pagini ce au fost prinse împreună cu o agrafă.

# Date de intrare

Fişierul de intrare `pagini.in` conţine pe prima linie numărul $n$ de pagini, iar pe următoarele $n$ linii câte un singur număr natural nenul, reprezentând numărul unei pagini din carte.

# Date de ieșire

Fişierul de ieşire `pagini.out` va conţine

- pe prima linie un singur număr reprezentând numărul de agrafe
- pe a doua linie un singur număr reprezentând cel mai mare număr de pagini ce au fost prinse împreună cu o agrafă. 

# Restricții și precizări

* $1 \leq n \leq 100 \ 000$;
* Valorile din vector sunt cel mult egale cu $10^6$

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def solve_pages(pages):
    pages.sort()  # Sort the pages
    num_pages = pages.size
    max_consecutive = 1
    num_staples = 1
    current_consecutive = 1

    for i in range(1, num_pages):
        if pages[i] == pages[i-1] + 1:  # Consecutive pages
            current_consecutive += 1
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
        else:
            num_staples += 1
            current_consecutive = 1

    return num_staples, max_consecutive

# Reading the input file
with open('pagini.in', 'r') as file:
    n = int(file.readline().strip())
    pages = np.array([int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)], dtype=np.int32)

# Solving the problem
num_staples, max_consecutive = solve_pages(pages)

# Writing the output file
with open('pagini.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{num_staples}\n{max_consecutive}\n")
```

I used numpy for efficient array storage to ensure low memory footprint and fast sorting. The dtype `np.int32` is chosen to minimize memory usage, considering the constraints of the problem. My solution reads the data from `pagini.in`, processes it to determine the number of staples required and the largest number of consecutive pages, then writes the results to `pagini.out`.

It seems that the environment where the solution is being run does not have the `numpy` module installed. Since using external libraries like `numpy` is not possible under these circumstances, I need to rewrite the solution without using `numpy` or any other non-standard Python library.

Here is a revised solution that only uses built-in Python data structures and functions to minimize memory usage:

```python
def read_pages(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pages = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    return pages

def write_output(file_path, num_staples, max_consecutive):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_staples}\n{max_consecutive}\n")

def solve_pages(pages):
    pages.sort()
    num_staples = 1
    max_consecutive = 1
    current_consecutive = 1

    for i in range(1, len(pages)):
        if pages[i] == pages[i - 1] + 1:
            current_consecutive += 1
        else:
            num_staples += 1
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
            current_consecutive = 1
    max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)  # Update for the last run

    return num_staples, max_consecutive

# Execute the solution
pages = read_pages('pagini.in')
num_staples, max_consecutive = solve_pages(pages)
write_output('pagini.out', num_staples, max_consecutive)
```

The above solution reads the input from `pagini.in`, processes the data to compute the required information, and then writes the output to `pagini.out`, all without using any external libraries. This solution should be very efficient in terms of both time and memory, fulfilling the requirements of the challenge.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result is due to incorrect handling of consecutive page sequences. The current implementation is incorrectly incrementing the `num_staples` counter every time it encounters a non-consecutive page number, without checking if the page numbers are actually part of a separate sequence.

This can be fixed by keeping track of the previously encountered page number and only incrementing the `num_staples` counter if the current page number is not the immediate next page of the previous one.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def read_pages(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pages = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    return pages

def write_output(file_path, num_staples, max_consecutive):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_staples}\n{max_consecutive}\n")

def solve_pages(pages):
    pages.sort()
    num_staples = 0
    max_consecutive = 0
    current_consecutive = 0
    prev_page = None

    for page in pages:
        if prev_page is None or page != prev_page + 1:
            num_staples += 1
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
            current_consecutive = 1
        else:
            current_consecutive += 1
        prev_page = page
    max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)  # Update for the last run

    return num_staples, max_consecutive

# Execute the solution
pages = read_pages('pagini.in')
num_staples, max_consecutive = solve_pages(pages)
write_output('pagini.out', num_staples, max_consecutive)
```

This implementation ensures that `num_staples` is incremented only when a new sequence of pages is encountered, and `max_consecutive` is updated to reflect the largest sequence of consecutive pages. It should now produce the expected output for the given input data.

Upon reviewing the previous solution and the expected output, I see that the logic to determine when a new staple is needed is incorrect. It should increment `num_staples` when the difference between the current page and the previous page is greater than 1, signifying that there's a break in the sequence of consecutive pages. Let's correct the implementation accordingly:

```python
def solve_pages(pages):
    pages.sort()
    num_staples = 1  # Start with one staple because we have at least one page
    max_consecutive = 1  # At least one page means a sequence of one
    current_consecutive = 1  # Current sequence also starts at one

    for i in range(1, len(pages)):
        if pages[i] == pages[i - 1] + 1:
            current_consecutive += 1  # Increment current consecutive count
        else:
            num_staples += 1  # Need a new staple for a non-consecutive page
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)  # Update max consecutive if needed
            current_consecutive = 1  # Reset the current consecutive count
    
    # Update max_consecutive for the last sequence
    max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)

    return num_staples, max_consecutive

# File operations are unchanged
def read_pages(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pages = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    return pages

def write_output(file_path, num_staples, max_consecutive):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_staples}\n{max_consecutive}\n")

# Execute the solution
pages = read_pages('pagini.in')
num_staples, max_consecutive = solve_pages(pages)
write_output('pagini.out', num_staples, max_consecutive)
```

This version of the solution should now properly increment `num_staples` only when encountering a non-consecutive page and thus produce the correct output. It should give 3 staples for the sequences (2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13), (21, 25, 26, 27) and (40), with the largest sequence being (21, 25, 26, 27) which is 4 pages long.

I apologize for the oversight. Upon further review, it seems that the previous solution did not correctly handle the check for non-consecutive pages. It incremented the `num_staples` counter whenever it encountered a page that was not immediately consecutive to the previous one, without accounting for the possibility that the pages might still be part of a consecutive series after sorting.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def read_pages(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pages = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    return pages

def write_output(file_path, num_staples, max_consecutive):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_staples}\n{max_consecutive}\n")

def solve_pages(pages):
    pages.sort()
    num_staples = 1
    max_consecutive = 1
    current_consecutive = 1

    for i in range(1, len(pages)):
        if pages[i] == pages[i - 1] + 1:
            current_consecutive += 1
        elif pages[i] != pages[i - 1]:  # Only increment if it's not a duplicate
            num_staples += 1
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
            current_consecutive = 1
    max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)  # Check last sequence

    return num_staples, max_consecutive

# Execute the solution
pages = read_pages('pagini.in')
num_staples, max_consecutive = solve_pages(pages)
write_output('pagini.out', num_staples, max_consecutive)
```

This corrected solution now checks if the current page is not just non-consecutive with the previous page (`pages[i] != pages[i - 1] + 1`), but also not a duplicate of the previous page (`pages[i] != pages[i - 1]`) before incrementing the `num_staples` counter. This ensures that consecutive sequences are captured correctly and that the `num_staples` counter reflects the correct number of stapled sequences after sorting the pages. This solution should now provide the expected output for the given input.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's address the issue again carefully.

The error in the previous solution appears to be in the handling of consecutive and non-consecutive page numbers. The logic should be:
1. Sort all pages to ensure they are in ascending order.
2. Iterate through the sorted page numbers and compare each page with the next one.
3. If the next page is consecutive (current page + 1), continue the sequence.
4. If the next page is not consecutive, end the current sequence, update the counters, and start a new sequence.
5. Throughout the iteration, keep track of the maximum length of consecutive pages and the number of staples (sequences) needed.

Let's correct the code with these rules in mind:

```python
def solve_pages(pages):
    pages.sort()
    num_staples = 0
    max_consecutive = 0
    current_consecutive = 0
    prev_page = None

    for page in pages:
        if prev_page is not None:
            if page == prev_page + 1:
                current_consecutive += 1
            else:
                num_staples += 1
                max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
                current_consecutive = 1
        else:
            # This is the first page, start a new sequence
            num_staples = 1
            current_consecutive = 1
        prev_page = page

    # Check the last sequence after the loop ends
    max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)

    return num_staples, max_consecutive

# Read the input data
pages = read_pages('pagini.in')

# Solve the problem
num_staples, max_consecutive = solve_pages(pages)

# Write the output data
write_output('pagini.out', num_staples, max_consecutive)
```

This revised solution implements the correct logic for counting consecutive page sequences and non-consecutive page breaks. It should now produce the correct output according to the rules outlined above. Testing this solution with the provided input data should yield the expected result.

The error indicates that the `read_pages` function is not defined, which is due to my oversight in not including the functions `read_pages` and `write_output` in the last solution provided. Let's correct this by implementing the missing functions and integrating them into the full solution:

```python
def read_pages(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        n = int(file.readline().strip())
        pages = [int(file.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]
    return pages

def write_output(file_path, num_staples, max_consecutive):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{num_staples}\n{max_consecutive}\n")

def solve_pages(pages):
    pages.sort()
    num_staples = 1  # Start with one staple because we have at least one page
    max_consecutive = 1  # At least one page means a sequence of one
    current_consecutive = 1  # Current sequence also starts at one

    for i in range(1, len(pages)):
        if pages[i] == pages[i - 1] + 1:
            current_consecutive += 1  # Increment current consecutive count
        elif pages[i] > pages[i - 1] + 1:  # Only increment if pages are not consecutive
            num_staples += 1  # Need a new staple for a non-consecutive page
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)  # Update max consecutive if needed
            current_consecutive = 1  # Reset the current consecutive count
    
    # Update max_consecutive for the last sequence
    max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)

    return num_staples, max_consecutive

# Execute the solution
pages = read_pages('pagini.in')
num_staples, max_consecutive = solve_pages(pages)
write_output('pagini.out', num_staples, max_consecutive)
```

The `read_pages` function reads the input file and returns a list of page numbers. The `write_output` function writes the result to the output file. The `solve_pages` function computes the number of staples required and the maximum number of consecutive pages. This time, I've included checks to ensure that only non-consecutive pages (greater than the previous page number by more than 1) result in an increment of the `num_staples` counter.

This solution should now work correctly and produce the expected output.
