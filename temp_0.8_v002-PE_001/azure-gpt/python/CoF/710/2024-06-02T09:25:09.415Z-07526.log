Principala misiune a unei expediții stiintifice este de a studia evoluția vieții pe o planetă nou descoperită. În urma studiilor efectuate, cercetătorii au asociat fiecărui organism viu descoperit pe acea planetă un cod caracteristic. Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

De asemenea, cercetătorii au observat că pentru orice organism viu de pe planetă, codurile caracteristice ale strămoșilor săi pe scara evoluției se pot obține prin ștergerea unor cifre din codul caracteristic al organismului respectiv, iar un organism este cu atât mai evoluat cu cât codul său caracteristic are o valoare mai mare.

# Cerință

Date fiind codurile caracteristice ale două organisme vii diferite, scrieți un program care să determine codul caracteristic al celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lor.


# Date de intrare


Fișierul de intrare `cod.in` conține:

* $n$ - codul caracteristic al primului organism
* $m$ - codul caracteristic al celui de-al doilea organism

# Date de ieșire


Fișierul de ieșire `cod.out` conține pe prima linie:

* $p$ – codul celui mai evoluat strămoș comun al lui $n$ si $m$

# Restricții și precizări

* Codul caracteristic este un număr natural de maximum $200$ de cifre zecimale nenule.

Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def find_common_ancestor(code1, code2):
    len1, len2 = len(code1), len(code2)
    
    # Create a 2D table to store the length of the longest common subsequence
    # of code1[0..i] and code2[0..j]
    dp = np.zeros((len1 + 1, len2 + 1), dtype=int)
    
    # Fill dp table
    for i in range(1, len1 + 1):
        for j in range(1, len2 + 1):
            if code1[i - 1] == code2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    # Reconstruct the code of the common ancestor from the dp table
    i, j = len1, len2
    common_ancestor_code = []
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if code1[i - 1] == code2[j - 1]:
            common_ancestor_code.append(code1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    
    return ''.join(reversed(common_ancestor_code))

# Read from 'cod.in'
with open('cod.in', 'r') as file:
    n = file.readline().strip()
    m = file.readline().strip()

# Find the common ancestor code
common_ancestor = find_common_ancestor(n, m)

# Write to 'cod.out'
with open('cod.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(common_ancestor + '\n')
```

This code solves the problem by finding the longest common subsequence between the two given codes, which can be done efficiently using dynamic programming and then reconstructing the common ancestor code by backtracking through the dynamic programming table. The use of numpy helps to efficiently create and manipulate the dynamic programming table within the memory constraints.

It seems that the numpy library is not available in the environment where this program is executed. To fix the issue, I will rewrite the solution without using numpy, relying only on standard Python libraries which are generally available. We can use a standard list of lists to create the 2D array for the dynamic programming table.

Here's the updated solution:

```python
def find_common_ancestor(code1, code2):
    len1, len2 = len(code1), len(code2)

    # Create a 2D table to store the length of the longest common subsequence
    # of code1[0..i] and code2[0..j]
    dp = [[0] * (len2 + 1) for _ in range(len1 + 1)]

    # Fill dp table
    for i in range(1, len1 + 1):
        for j in range(1, len2 + 1):
            if code1[i - 1] == code2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Reconstruct the code of the common ancestor from the dp table
    i, j = len1, len2
    common_ancestor_code = []
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if code1[i - 1] == code2[j - 1]:
            common_ancestor_code.append(code1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    return ''.join(reversed(common_ancestor_code))

# Read from 'cod.in'
with open('cod.in', 'r') as file:
    n = file.readline().strip()
    m = file.readline().strip()

# Find the common ancestor code
common_ancestor = find_common_ancestor(n, m)

# Write to 'cod.out'
with open('cod.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(common_ancestor + '\n')
```

This solution should work within the memory and environment constraints specified, as it does not depend on external libraries such as numpy. The dynamic programming approach remains the same, but we use a list of lists to implement the 2D array needed for the algorithm.

The output of the program differs from the expected output because the solution implemented is finding the longest common subsequence of the two given codes, but it does not guarantee that this subsequence represents the most significant digits that form the largest possible common ancestor code. We need to adjust the approach to ensure that the common ancestor code we find is the largest possible value, not just any longest common subsequence.

To do this, we need to modify the code to prefer digits that are larger and appear earlier in both strings whenever possible. Instead of using a dynamic programming approach, we need to traverse both strings from left to right and build the largest possible number by always taking the larger digit that is present in both strings.

Here’s the corrected solution:

```python
def find_common_ancestor(code1, code2):
    i = j = 0
    common_ancestor_code = []

    while i < len(code1) and j < len(code2):
        # Find the next matching digit that is the same in both codes
        while i < len(code1) and (j == len(code2) or code1[i] != code2[j]):
            i += 1

        # If match is found, add it to the ancestor code
        if i < len(code1) and j < len(code2) and code1[i] == code2[j]:
            common_ancestor_code.append(code1[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1

    return ''.join(common_ancestor_code)

# Read from 'cod.in'
with open('cod.in', 'r') as file:
    n = file.readline().strip()
    m = file.readline().strip()

# Find the common ancestor code
common_ancestor = find_common_ancestor(n, m)

# Write to 'cod.out'
with open('cod.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(common_ancestor + '\n')
```

This solution iterates through both codes and builds the common ancestor code by matching digits from left to right, which ensures that we get the largest possible common ancestor code. It no longer uses a dynamic programming approach, so the memory usage will also be lower.

The issue with the previous solution is that it only checks for the first occurrence of the matching digit in the second code (`code2[j]`) starting from the current position `j`, and immediately proceeds with the next digits, which can lead to missing longer subsequences if a matching digit appears later in both codes.

Given that we want to find the largest possible value for the common ancestor code, we need to choose the digits from both codes that provide maximum value while preserving the relative order in both codes. This can be achieved by using a greedy approach with two pointers.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Read from 'cod.in'
with open('cod.in', 'r') as file:
    n = file.readline().strip()
    m = file.readline().strip()

# Find common ancestor code using a greedy approach
def find_common_ancestor(code1, code2):
    i, j = 0, 0
    ancestor_code = []
    while i < len(code1) and j < len(code2):
        # Find the smaller next index of the current code1[i] in code2 starting from j
        next_index_in_code2 = code2.find(code1[i], j)

        if next_index_in_code2 != -1:
            ancestor_code.append(code1[i])
            j = next_index_in_code2 + 1  # Move j to the next position after the found character
        i += 1
        
    return ''.join(ancestor_code)

common_ancestor = find_common_ancestor(n, m)

# Write to 'cod.out'
with open('cod.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(common_ancestor + '\n')
```

In this corrected version, we use the `find` method to search for the next occurrence of the current `code1[i]` digit in `code2` starting from the current `j`. If found, we add the digit to the common ancestor code and update the pointer `j` to look for the next digit after the one we just found. This ensures that we are always building the highest value ancestor code by the given rules.
