Un elev a desenat un set format din mai multe pătrate care conțin numere naturale nenule, distincte, consecutive, dispuse în număr egal pe laturi. Pe latura fiecărui pătrat sunt scrise un număr impar de valori. În fiecare pătrat, numerele sunt scrise în ordine crescătoare parcurgând laturile sale, începând din colțul stânga-jos, în sensul invers al acelor de ceasornic. Elevul a numerotat pătratele cu $1$, $2$, $3$ etc. , în ordinea strict crescătoare a numărului de valori conținute de fiecare. Diferența dintre cel mai mic număr din pătratul $P$ ($1$ < $P$) și cel mai mare număr din pătratul $P - 1$ este egală cu $1$. Primele **patru** pătrate sunt:

Astfel, primul pătrat conține numerele naturale distincte consecutive de la $1$ la $8$, dispuse câte **trei** pe fiecare latură a pătratului. Al doilea pătrat conține următoarele $16$ numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte cinci pe fiecare latură. Al treilea pătrat conține următoarele $24$ de numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte șapte pe fiecare latură.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since we are optimizing for both time and memory and are under a strict memory limit, it is better to avoid using `numpy` altogether and instead use only the standard library.

Let's rewrite the solution without `numpy`.

```python

    # Therefore, the number of values K in square M is:
    # K = (side length * 4) - 4 = (2M - 1) * 4 - 4
    return (2 * M - 1) * 4 - 4

    # of the number of values contained in the squares up to T. This is because
    # the square number T starts at the number (T^2 - T + 1).
    # We use integer arithmetic to solve for T using the quadratic formula.
    # Since we want the smallest T, we only consider the positive root.

    # Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation
    discriminant = 1 + (N - 1)

    x = n
    y = (x + 1) // 2

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that there is a mistake in the formula used to calculate the number of values (K) contained in the square numbered M. Upon reviewing the initial explanation, I realized that the formula provided was incorrect, and we need to fix the calculation.

The correct formula for calculating the number of values contained in square M is as follows:

Each side of the square numbered M contains 2M - 1 values (since it's an odd number). There are four sides, but since each of the four corners is counted on two sides, we subtract 4 to avoid double-counting. Therefore, the total number of values K in square M is:

K = 4 * (2M - 1) - 4

Now let's rewrite the correct solution.

```python
# Function to calculate the number of values contained in square M
def find_values_in_square(M):
    # Each side of square M has 2M - 1 values (since it has to be an odd number)
    # There are 4 sides and we subtract 4 to avoid double counting the corners
    return 4 * (2 * M - 1) - 4

# Function to calculate the square number T that contains the number N on one of its sides
def find_square_containing_number(N):
    # We start from 1 since the first square starts at number 1
    T = 1
    # The first square has 8 numbers, so we start counting from 9 for the second square
    current_number = 9
    while current_number <= N:
        # The side length of the next square is 2 more than the previous one
        T += 1
        # Calculate how many numbers are in the new square
        numbers_in_square = 4 * (2 * T - 1) - 4
        # Update the current number to the last number of the current square
        current_number += numbers_in_square
    return T

# Function to compute the integer square root of a number
def isqrt(n):
    x = n
    y = (x + 1) // 2
    while y < x:
        x = y
        y = (x + n // x) // 2
    return x

# Read the input data
with open('patrate.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    if C == 1:
        M = int(file.readline().strip())
    elif C == 2:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Compute the output and write it to a file
with open('patrate.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        K = find_values_in_square(M)
        file.write(f'{K}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        # Use a different approach since the previous approach was not correct
        T = find_square_containing_number(N)
        file.write(f'{T}\n')
``` 

This corrected version should provide the correct result for both task 1 and task 2 of the challenge.

It seems there is still a mistake in the calculation of K. The expected output for M=3 is 24, but the code is incorrectly outputting 16. This suggests that the formula used in the function find_values_in_square(M) is not correct. 

Let's revisit the problem and redefine the correct logic:

- The first square has 3 numbers on each side, making it 8 numbers in total (since the corner number is shared by two sides).
- The second square will have 5 numbers on each side, making it 16 numbers in total.
- The third square will have 7 numbers on each side, making it 24 numbers in total.
- So, the pattern is that the \(n\)-th square has \(4n+4(n-1)\) numbers in total, which simplifies to \(8n\).

This means that the number of values in square M (K) should be calculated as \(8 \times M\).

Now let's fix the function and rewrite the solution accordingly.

```python
# Function to calculate the number of values contained in square M
def find_values_in_square(M):
    # The pattern identified is that the nth square contains 8n numbers.
    return 8 * M

# Function to calculate the square number T that contains the number N on one of its sides
def find_square_containing_number(N):
    # We can find the square number by dividing N by 8 and rounding up.
    # This works because each square contains 8 numbers more than the previous one.
    # We subtract 1 before dividing because the sequence starts at 1, not 0.
    T = (N - 1) // 8 + 1
    return T

# Read the input data from the file patrate.in
with open('patrate.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    if C == 1:
        M = int(file.readline().strip())
    elif C == 2:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Write the output to the file patrate.out
with open('patrate.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        # Task 1: Find the number of values in square M
        K = find_values_in_square(M)
        file.write(f'{K}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        # Task 2: Find the square number that contains N on one of its sides
        T = find_square_containing_number(N)
        file.write(f'{T}\n')
```

This new implementation should now provide the correct output for both cases. The logic has been simplified, and formulas have been corrected to correctly calculate the number of values in square M and to find the square number that contains N.

The discrepancy in output for the input data provided suggests that the logic used in the `find_square_containing_number(N)` function is incorrect. The problem specifies that each square is sequentially filled with consecutive natural numbers along its perimeter, with each subsequent square having an odd number of values on each side, starting from 3 for the first square, 5 for the second, and so on. Each square contains exactly 8 more values than the previous one.

Since the provided logic does not yield the expected output, let's re-evaluate and craft a new solution. The correct approach to finding the square number T that contains the number N is as follows:

1. We need to find the total count of numbers up to and including the square that contains N. This total count \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \( S = 8 + 16 + 24 + ... + 8T = 8(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + T) \)

2. The sum of the first \( T \) natural numbers is \( \frac{T(T + 1)}{2} \), so the equation becomes:
   \( S = 8 \times \frac{T(T + 1)}{2} \)

3. We need to find the smallest integer \( T \) such that \( S \geq N \).

4. We can reverse the formula to solve for \( T \) given \( N \) by rearranging the terms and solving the quadratic inequality.

After adjusting the logic, let's rewrite the `find_square_containing_number(N)` function and the entire solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of values contained in square M
def find_values_in_square(M):
    # Based on the sequence provided, each square M has 8M values in total
    return 8 * M

# Function to calculate the square number T that contains the number N on one of its sides
def find_square_containing_number(N):
    # Counter for the number of squares
    T = 0
    # Counter for the total count of numbers
    total_count = 0
    # Increment T until the total count surpasses N
    while total_count < N:
        T += 1
        total_count += 8 * T
    return T

# Read the input data from the file patrate.in
with open('patrate.in', 'r') as file:
    C = int(file.readline().strip())
    if C == 1:
        M = int(file.readline().strip())
    elif C == 2:
        N = int(file.readline().strip())

# Write the output to the file patrate.out
with open('patrate.out', 'w') as file:
    if C == 1:
        # Task 1: Find the number of values in square M
        K = find_values_in_square(M)
        file.write(f'{K}\n')
    elif C == 2:
        # Task 2: Find the square number that contains N on one of its sides
        T = find_square_containing_number(N)
        file.write(f'{T}\n')
```

This implementation no longer uses the incorrect division logic and instead calculates the total number count in sequence until it surpasses N, effectively determining the square \( T \) that contains \( N \).
