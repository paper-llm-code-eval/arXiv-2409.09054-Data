Un elev a desenat un set format din mai multe pătrate care conțin numere naturale nenule, distincte, consecutive, dispuse în număr egal pe laturi. Pe latura fiecărui pătrat sunt scrise un număr impar de valori. În fiecare pătrat, numerele sunt scrise în ordine crescătoare parcurgând laturile sale, începând din colțul stânga-jos, în sensul invers al acelor de ceasornic. Elevul a numerotat pătratele cu $1$, $2$, $3$ etc. , în ordinea strict crescătoare a numărului de valori conținute de fiecare. Diferența dintre cel mai mic număr din pătratul $P$ ($1$ < $P$) și cel mai mare număr din pătratul $P - 1$ este egală cu $1$. Primele **patru** pătrate sunt:

~[patrate.png]

Astfel, primul pătrat conține numerele naturale distincte consecutive de la $1$ la $8$, dispuse câte **trei** pe fiecare latură a pătratului. Al doilea pătrat conține următoarele $16$ numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte cinci pe fiecare latură. Al treilea pătrat conține următoarele $24$ de numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte șapte pe fiecare latură. Al patrulea pătrat conține următoarele $32$ de numere naturale distincte consecutive, dispuse câte nouă pe fiecare latură etc.

# Cerință

2. citește un număr natural $N$ și determină numărul $T$ al pătratului care conține numărul $N$ pe una dintre laturi.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `patrate.in` conține pe prima linie un număr natural $C$ reprezentând cerința din problemă care trebuie rezolvată ($1$ sau $2$). Dacă $C = 1$, atunci fișierul conține pe a doua linie numărul natural $M$. Dacă $C = 2$, atunci fișierul conține pe a doua linie numărul natural $N$.

# Date de ieșire

Dacă $C = 1$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `patrate.out` conține pe prima linie numărul $K$, reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $1$ a problemei. Dacă $C = 2$, atunci fișierul de ieșire `patrate.out` conține pe prima linie numărul natural $T$, reprezentând răspunsul la cerința $2$.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not found, which means it is not installed in the environment where the code is being run. For the given problem, however, `numpy` is not strictly necessary, and we can write a solution without it to fit within the memory constraints and environment limitations. Let's refactor the solution without using `numpy`.

        total_values = 4 * side_length - 4  # Calculate total values for the new square

Upon evaluating the discrepancy, it's apparent that the provided solution for calculating `K` given `M` is incorrect. The logic that calculates `K` should consider that each subsequent square has an increasing number of values based on the square’s perimeter. Specifically, square `M` has a side length of `2M-1` values, and the number of values is the perimeter minus the 4 corners which are counted only once.

We must implement this logic correctly to match the expected results. Let's correct the function `find_K` to properly calculate the number of values `K` for square `M`.

```python
# Function to calculate K given M, correctly accounting for the arithmetic progression
def find_K(M):
    # The first square (M=1) has 8 values (3 on each side, excluding the last corner counted twice)
    # From the second square (M=2) onwards, each square adds an additional 2 values to each side
    # Therefore, each square has (2M - 1) values on each side, excluding the last corner counted twice
    # Hence, K = 4 * (side length) - 4
    side_length = (2 * M - 1)
    return 4 * side_length - 4

# Function to calculate T given N, optimized for memory usage
def find_T(N):
    # Side length increases by 2 for each square (3, 5, 7, ...)
    # Start with side length 1 (which would correspond to an invalid 0th square)
    side_length = 1
    current_max = 0

    # Loop until we find the square containing the value N
    # The maximum value in any square will be side_length^2 since we are adding side_length - 1 values to all four sides
    # from the previous square's maximum value
    while current_max < N:
        side_length += 2  # Increment the side length to get to the next square
        current_max = side_length**2  # Update the maximum value for the new square

    # The square number is the side length divided by 2, rounded up, since side_length = 2M - 1
    return (side_length + 1) // 2

# Read the input from 'patrate.in'
with open('patrate.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    problem_type = int(lines[0].strip())
    number = int(lines[1].strip())

# Solve the problem based on the input type and write the output to 'patrate.out'
with open('patrate.out', 'w') as file:
    if problem_type == 1:
        result = find_K(number)
    elif problem_type == 2:
        result = find_T(number)
    file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This corrected solution should produce the correct output for the input given and adhere to the problem's constraints, including those for time and memory efficiency.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result comes from an error in the calculation of `K` in the `find_K` function. The expected output indicates that the third square should have 24 values, but the output from the function is 16, which is incorrect.

The correct calculation for `K`, given a square number `M`, is to find the total number of values contained within that square. As each side of square `M` has `2M+1` values (since each square has an odd number of values per side), the total number of values `K` for square `M` is `(2M+1) * 4 - 4`. The `-4` accounts for not double-counting the four corners.

Let's correct the function `find_K` and rewrite the solution.

```python
# Function to calculate K given M, correctly accounting for the arithmetic progression
def find_K(M):
    # Each side of square M has (2M+1) values, so total values are 4 sides times the number of values per side minus 4 (corners are counted once)
    return (2 * M + 1) * 4 - 4

# Function to calculate T given N, optimized for memory usage
def find_T(N):
    # To find which square contains N, notice that the largest number in square M is (2M+1)^2, which is the square of the side length
    # We need to find M such that (2M-1)^2 < N <= (2M+1)^2
    # We can start with M=1 and increment until we find the correct M
    M = 1
    while (2 * M + 1)**2 < N:
        M += 1
    return M

# Read the input from 'patrate.in'
with open('patrate.in', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    problem_type = int(lines[0].strip())
    number = int(lines[1].strip())

# Solve the problem based on the input type and write the output to 'patrate.out'
with open('patrate.out', 'w') as file:
    if problem_type == 1:
        result = find_K(number)
    elif problem_type == 2:
        result = find_T(number)
    file.write(f'{result}\n')
```

This corrected solution should now give the correct output for the given input and any other inputs within the problem's constraints.
