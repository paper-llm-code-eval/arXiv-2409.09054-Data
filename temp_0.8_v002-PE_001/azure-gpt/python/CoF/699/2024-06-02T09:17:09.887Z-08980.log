Se consideră harta universului ca fiind o matrice cu $250$ de linii şi $250$ de coloane. În fiecare celulă se găseşte o aşa numită poartă stelară, iar în anumite celule se găsesc echipaje ale porţii stelare. La o deplasare, un echipaj se poate deplasa din locul în care se află în oricare alt loc în care se găseşte o a doua poartă, în cazul nostru în orice altă poziţie din matrice. Nu se permite situarea simultană a mai mult de un echipaj într-o celulă. La un moment dat un singur echipaj se poate deplasa de la o poartă stelară la alta.

# Cerință

Dându-se un număr $p$ de echipaje, pentru fiecare echipaj fiind precizate poziţia iniţială şi poziţia finală, determinaţi numărul minim de deplasări necesare pentru ca toate echipajele să ajungă din poziţia iniţială în cea finală.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `poarta.in` are următorul format:
- pe prima linie se află numărul natural $p$ reprezentând numărul echipaje.
- pe următoarele $p$ linii se află câte 4 numere naturale, primele două reprezentând coordonatele poziţiei iniţiale a unui echipaj (linie respectiv coloană), următoarele două reprezentând coordonatele poziţiei finale a aceluiaşi echipaj (linie respectiv coloană).

# Date de ieşire
Pe prima linie a fişierului de ieșire `poarta.out` se scrie un singur număr reprezentând numărul minim de deplasări necesar.

# Restricții și precizări
- $1 < p < 5\ 000$
- Coordonatele poziţiilor iniţiale şi finale ale echipajelor sunt numere naturale din intervalul $[1, 250]$.
- **Atenție la cazurile când poziția inițială este identică cu cea finală!**
- Poziţiile iniţiale ale celor $p$ echipaje sunt distincte două câte două.
- Poziţiile finale ale celor $p$ echipaje sunt distincte două câte două.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

# Read from the input file
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    initial_positions = np.zeros((p, 2), dtype=int)
    final_positions = np.zeros((p, 2), dtype=int)
    
    for i in range(p):
        line = file.readline().split()
        initial_positions[i] = [int(line[0]), int(line[1])]
        final_positions[i] = [int(line[2]), int(line[3])]

# Optimize the number of movements
# Since each crew can teleport to any gate directly, the minimum number of moves is equal to the number of crews
# that do not start at their final positions.
num_moves = np.sum(np.any(initial_positions != final_positions, axis=1))

# Write to the output file
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_moves))
```

This Python code should find the minimal number of moves required for all crews to reach their final positions. Note that the code is using NumPy for efficient memory usage and is expecting that coordinates in the input are within the valid range and satisfy the constraints given. The solution reads from 'poarta.in' and writes the result to 'poarta.out'.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. This could be because the environment where the code is being executed doesn't have the `numpy` module installed, or because this is a restricted environment that doesn't allow for external libraries like `numpy`.

Since the environment doesn't support `numpy`, we will need to use built-in Python data structures and algorithms to solve the problem efficiently while still considering memory usage.

Here's a revised solution that only uses built-in Python features:

```python
# Helper function to read the crew positions from the file
def read_positions(file, p):
    positions = []
    for _ in range(p):
        line = file.readline().split()
        positions.append(tuple(map(int, line[:2])))
    return positions

# Read from the input file
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    initial_positions_set = set(read_positions(file, p))
    final_positions_set = set(read_positions(file, p))

# Optimize the number of movements
# Since each crew can teleport to any gate directly, the minimum number of moves is equal to the number of crews
# that do not start at their final positions.
num_moves = sum(1 for position in initial_positions_set if position not in final_positions_set)

# Write to the output file
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_moves))
```

This solution reads the initial and final positions as sets of tuples (to conserve memory and allow for fast lookup) and calculates the minimum number of moves by counting how many initial positions are not already at their final positions. No `numpy` is used, so this should run in a Python environment without any extra libraries installed.

The error in the previous solution is due to reading the final positions into the same set as the initial positions, which is incorrect. We need to keep track of both the initial and final positions separately to calculate the number of moves correctly.

The number of moves required is not simply the number of crews not starting at their final positions, since some crews may already be at their desired final position. We must also consider that an initial position of one crew might be the final position of another crew, which requires a move to vacate that position.

Let's reimplement the solution correctly:

```python
# Helper function to read the crew positions from the file
def read_positions(file, p):
    positions = []
    for _ in range(p):
        line = file.readline().split()
        positions.append(tuple(map(int, line)))
    return positions

# Read from the input file
with open('poarta.in', 'r') as file:
    p = int(file.readline().strip())
    crews = read_positions(file, p)

# Calculate the number of moves required
num_moves = 0
# Use a dictionary to keep track of desired final positions
final_positions = {}
for i in range(p):
    initial, final = crews[i][:2], crews[i][2:]
    # If initial is not final position, increment.
    if initial != final:
        num_moves += 1
        final_positions[final] = final_positions.get(final, 0) + 1
        if initial in final_positions and final_positions[initial] > 0:
            # If initial position is someone's final position, decrement that count
            final_positions[initial] -= 1
            num_moves -= 1

# Write to the output file
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_moves))
```

In this solution, we use a dictionary to keep track of how many crews want to end up in each position. We iterate through each crew, and if a crew's initial position is not their final position, we increment the number of moves. If a crew's initial position matches another crew's final position, we decrement the number of moves since they can swap positions.

This implementation should correctly calculate the minimal number of moves required and fit within the memory constraints, using only built-in Python structures.

Upon re-evaluating the logic, I see that my previous solution does not handle the cases where multiple swaps are needed correctly. The problem is that we need to consider each crew's movement as an independent event and not just a simple swap. The correct minimum number of moves in this case is essentially the number of crews that need to move, minus the number of cycles that exist in the permutation of crews to their final positions. When a cycle exists, all crews in that cycle can be moved with one less move than the number of crews in the cycle.

To handle this, I will implement a solution that creates a permutation cycle from the initial and final positions and calculates the number of moves required.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Function to parse the input file into a list of moves
def parse_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    return p, moves

# Function to count the permutation cycles in the list of moves
def count_cycles(p, moves):
    # Create a mapping from initial to final positions
    move_map = {initial: final for initial, final in moves}
    visited = set()
    cycles = 0
    
    for initial in move_map:
        # If we've already visited this position, continue
        if initial in visited:
            continue
        
        # If the initial position is the same as the final, it doesn't count as a cycle
        if move_map[initial] == initial:
            visited.add(initial)
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, start a new cycle
        current = initial
        while current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            current = move_map[current]
        
        cycles += 1
    
    return cycles

# Function to calculate the number of moves
def calculate_moves(p, cycles):
    # The total number of moves is the number of crews that need to move,
    # minus the number of cycles
    return p - cycles

# Read the input data
p, moves = parse_input('poarta.in')

# Count the cycles
cycles = count_cycles(p, moves)

# Calculate the number of moves
num_moves = calculate_moves(p, cycles)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_moves))
```

This solution reads the initial and final positions, counts the number of cycles in the permutation, and calculates the number of moves by subtracting the number of cycles from the number of crews that need to move. This accounts for the fact that within a cycle, all crews except one can be moved to their final position with a single move per crew.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` caused by trying to unpack more values than expected. The code is expecting tuples with two elements, but the input actually contains tuples with four elements (initial line, initial column, final line, final column).

The solution is to fix the unpacking by handling all four elements when creating the `move_map`. We will use pairs (line, column) to represent positions.

Here's the fixed solution:

```python
# Function to parse the input file into a list of moves
def parse_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    return p, moves

# Function to count the permutation cycles in the list of moves
def count_cycles(p, moves):
    # Create a mapping from initial to final positions
    move_map = {initial: final for initial, _, final in moves}
    visited = set()
    cycles = 0
    
    for initial in move_map:
        # If we've already visited this position, continue
        if initial in visited:
            continue
        
        # If the initial position is the same as the final, it doesn't count as a cycle
        if move_map[initial] == initial:
            visited.add(initial)
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, start a new cycle
        current = initial
        while current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            current = move_map[current]
        
        cycles += 1
    
    return cycles

# Function to calculate the number of moves
def calculate_moves(p, cycles):
    # The total number of moves is the number of crews that need to move,
    # minus the number of cycles
    return p - cycles

# Read the input data
p, moves = parse_input('poarta.in')

# Count the cycles
cycles = count_cycles(p, moves)

# Calculate the number of moves
num_moves = calculate_moves(p, cycles)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_moves))
```

In the `parse_input` function, I modified the `moves` list to store tuples with four elements. Then, in the `count_cycles` function, I adjusted the dictionary comprehension to create a mapping from initial positions to final positions, each represented as a pair (line, column). The rest of the code remains the same and should now run without errors, correctly unpacking the four-element tuples and calculating the moves.

The error occurred because the dictionary comprehension in the `count_cycles` function is trying to unpack each move tuple into three variables, but each tuple actually contains four elements. To represent the initial and final positions as pairs (line, column), we should unpack the tuples correctly into four variables and then use the pairs in the dictionary.

Let's fix the errors and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to parse the input file into a list of moves
def parse_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    return p, moves

# Function to count the permutation cycles in the list of moves
def count_cycles(p, moves):
    # Create a mapping from initial to final positions
    move_map = {initial: final for initial, final in 
                ((move[:2], move[2:]) for move in moves)}
    visited = set()
    cycles = 0
    
    for initial in move_map:
        # If we've already visited this position, continue
        if initial in visited:
            continue
        
        # If the initial position is the same as the final, it doesn't count as a cycle
        if move_map[initial] == initial:
            visited.add(initial)
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, start a new cycle
        current = initial
        while current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            current = move_map[current]
        
        cycles += 1
    
    return cycles

# Function to calculate the number of moves
def calculate_moves(p, cycles):
    # The total number of moves is the number of crews that need to move,
    # minus the number of cycles
    return p - cycles

# Read the input data
p, moves = parse_input('poarta.in')

# Count the cycles
cycles = count_cycles(p, moves)

# Calculate the number of moves
num_moves = calculate_moves(p, cycles)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_moves))
```

Now, the `count_cycles` function correctly creates a `move_map` with initial and final positions as pairs. It then counts the cycles as before, which will give us the correct number of moves.

This adjusted code should now accurately compute the minimum number of moves by considering the cycles in the permutation of crews to their final positions.

The error message indicates a `KeyError`, which implies that the `current` key is not found within the `move_map` dictionary. This happens because the code is assuming that every initial position will be a key in `move_map`, which is not the case. If the final position of one crew is not an initial position of another crew, this error will occur.

To fix this, I will revise the code to ensure that we only iterate over initial positions that are also keys in the `move_map`. Furthermore, I will refine the implementation of the cycle detection algorithm to properly handle standalone points and cycles.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fixes:

```python
# Function to parse the input file into a list of moves
def parse_input(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        p = int(file.readline().strip())
        moves = [tuple(map(int, file.readline().split())) for _ in range(p)]
    return p, moves

# Function to count the permutation cycles in the list of moves
def count_cycles(p, moves):
    # Create a mapping from initial to final positions
    move_map = {initial: final for initial, final in ((move[:2], move[2:]) for move in moves)}
    visited = set()
    cycles = 0
    
    for initial in move_map.keys():
        # If we've already visited this position, continue
        if initial in visited:
            continue

        # Track the current path and check for cycles
        path = set()
        current = initial
        while current not in path:
            path.add(current)
            current = move_map.get(current, current)
        
        visited.update(path)
        # Only count as a cycle if we ended where we started and it's not a single point
        if current == initial and len(path) > 1:
            cycles += 1
    
    return cycles

# Function to calculate the number of moves
def calculate_moves(p, cycles):
    # The total number of moves is the number of crews that need to move,
    # minus the number of cycles
    return p - cycles + len(cycles)  # Add the length of each cycle to account for each move within the cycle

# Read the input data
p, moves = parse_input('poarta.in')

# Count the cycles
cycles = count_cycles(p, moves)

# Calculate the number of moves
num_moves = calculate_moves(p, cycles)

# Write the result to the output file
with open('poarta.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(num_moves))
```

In this fixed implementation, we use `move_map.get(current, current)` to get the next position in the cycle or stay at the current position if it's not in the `move_map`. This ensures that we don't get a `KeyError` when a final position is not an initial position of another crew. We then only count a sequence as a cycle if we return to the starting point and the path contains more than one point. Lastly, when calculating the number of moves, we subtract the number of cycles but add back the length of each cycle to account for all the moves within the cycle.
