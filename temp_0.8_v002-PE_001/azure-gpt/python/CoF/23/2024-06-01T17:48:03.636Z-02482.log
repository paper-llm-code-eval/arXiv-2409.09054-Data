Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.
* Pentru teste in valoare de `18` puncte datele de intrare sunt cunoscute. Mai precis:
Testul 0 : `n = 91, e = 90`
Testul 1 : `n = 30, e = 435`
Testul 2 : `n = 7, e = 16`
* Pentru alte teste in valoare de `15` puncte `n≤9`.

Explanation:
- This solution starts by reading the number of buckets `n` and the required effort `e` from the input file `galeti.in`.
- It initializes a NumPy array `water_volumes` to track the volume of water in each bucket. All buckets except the first one are set to contain 1 liter of water.
- The `operations` list will store the sequence of pours. Each pour is represented by a tuple `(from_bucket, to_bucket)` using 1-based indexing, as required in the output.
- The function `pour(from_bucket, to_bucket)` models the pour operation, updates the effort spent, and modifies the `water_volumes` array accordingly.
- The main logic is to iterate from the last bucket to the second one, pouring water into the closest non-empty bucket to the left until the total effort spent matches `e`.
- If the effort spent exceeds `e`, it's not possible to achieve the exact effort, and the `operations` list is cleared.
- The sequence of pours is written to the output file `galeti.out`.
- This algorithm is efficient in terms of time complexity, performing operations in linear time relative to the number of buckets.

```

This revised solution takes into account the restrictions mentioned. It does not use `input()` or `print()` functions and works efficiently using a greedy approach. The key idea is to pour from the rightmost non-empty bucket to its immediate left non-empty bucket until the desired effort is reached. If the exact effort cannot be achieved, it outputs no operations. This solution is sensitive to memory usage and is designed to handle large input sizes within the constraints specified.

```

This Python code reads from a file named `galeti.in` and writes to a file named `galeti.out`, as per the requirements. It initializes a list to keep track of water in each bucket, with the first bucket starting empty. The variable `e` is used to keep track of the remaining effort after each pouring operation. The code iterates backward from the last bucket and performs pours while ensuring that the remaining effort does not drop below zero. If the exact effort `e` is not achieved, it records an "impossible" operation in the operations list. The results are then written to `galeti.out`.

```python
# Solution using binomial coefficients and combinatorics

# Read the input data from 'galeti.in'
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the array to store the water volume in each bucket
# We will store the buckets in reverse order for easier calculations
buckets = [0] * (n + 1)
buckets[n] = n  # Since we are going to empty the last bucket completely

# List to store the operations
operations = []

# Calculate the sequence of pours
# Start from the last bucket and proceed to pour water into the leftmost non-empty bucket
# The effort for each operation is the index of the bucket since each contains 1 litre of water initially
i = n
while i > 1 and e >= i:
    e -= i
    buckets[i] = 0  # Empty the bucket
    i -= 1          # Move to the next bucket to the left
    operations.append((n - i + 1, n))  # Record the operation, adjusting for 1-based indexing

# Now we need to distribute the remaining effort across the buckets
for j in range(i, 0, -1):
    while e >= j:
        e -= j
        operations.append((n - j + 1, n - i + 1))  # Record the operation
        i -= 1  # The water is effectively moved to the next left bucket

# Write the output data to 'galeti.out'
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    for operation in operations:
        file.write(f"{operation[0]} {operation[1]}\n")
```
```

In this updated solution, we start by reading the input from the file `galeti.in`. We then initialize an array `buckets` that tracks the water in each bucket, which we fill in reverse order to keep track of the remaining water easily. The main loop pours water from the rightmost non-empty bucket to the leftmost non-empty bucket until the effort `e` is less than the index of the bucket we're pouring from. We record each operation in the `operations` list.

After the main loop, if any effort `e` remains, we distribute it across the buckets from right to left. Finally, we write the operations to the file `galeti.out`. We ensure not to exceed the memory limit by using a list of integers and writing directly to the file without using excessive memory.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is the updated solution to the problem, which correctly reads from `galeti.in` and writes to `galeti.out` without using `input()` or `print()`.

```markdown
```python
# Efficient solution for the buckets problem using combinatorics
# Uses a greedy approach to determine the sequence of pours

def solve_buckets_problem(n, e):
    operations = []
    current_sum = 0  

    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        while current_sum + i <= e:
            operations.append((i, 1))
            current_sum += i
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                if j not in [op[0] for op in operations]:
                    operations.append((j, i))
                    break
    
    return operations if current_sum == e else []

# Read the input data from 'galeti.in'
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n, e = map(int, file_in.readline().split())

# Solve the problem
operations = solve_buckets_problem(n, e)

# Write the output data to 'galeti.out'
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for op in operations:
        file_out.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
```
```

This solution defines a function `solve_buckets_problem` which takes the number of buckets `n` and the target effort `e`, and then computes the sequence of pours needed. It uses a greedy algorithm to fill the first bucket by repeatedly pouring the rightmost non-empty bucket into it until the effort matches `e`. If the final sum of effort does not match `e`, it returns an empty list indicating that there is no solution under the given constraints.

The solution avoids storing the entire state of all buckets, which might exceed the memory limit, by only storing the sequence of pours. This is more memory-efficient and should keep the solution within the 8MB memory limit. The sequence of pours is directly written to the output file `galeti.out` as required.

def find_pours(n, e):
    # Initialize an array representing all buckets filled with 1 litre
    # except the first one, which is our target bucket for the water
    buckets = np.ones(n)

        while j > 0 and buckets[j] == 0:
            j -= 1

        # Perform the operation
        if total_effort + i <= e:  # Make sure not to exceed the desired effort
            buckets[j] += buckets[i]
            buckets[i] = 0
            total_effort += i
            operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))  # Record the operation (1-indexed)

    # If the exact effort e is not matched, no solution is possible
    if total_effort != e:
        return None

    return operations

# Read from 'galeti.in'
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as input_file:
    n, e = map(int, input_file.readline().split())

# Find the pouring operations
pouring_operations = find_pours(n, e)

# Write to 'galeti.out'
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as output_file:
    if pouring_operations is not None:
        for op in pouring_operations:
            output_file.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
    else:
        # If there is no solution, write an impossible case to the file (or leave it empty)
        output_file.write("impossible\n")
```
```

This improved solution reads the number of buckets `n` and the required effort `e` from 'galeti.in'. It then uses a numpy array to represent the buckets, which is more memory-efficient than a standard Python list for large numbers of elements. The `find_pours` function calculates the sequence of pouring operations without exceeding the memory limit and writes the results to 'galeti.out'. If no solution is possible, the code writes "impossible" to the output file, which is not explicitly required by the problem but provides clear feedback.

I apologize for the oversight. Here is the corrected solution that adheres to the problem constraints:

```markdown
```python
# Solution using a greedy algorithm to find the sequence of pours

def generate_sequence(n, e):
    # Create a list to store the amount of water in each bucket
    buckets = [1] * n
    buckets[0] = 0
    
    # This list will store the operations
    operations = []
    
    # We start by trying to pour from the last bucket and move leftwards
    for i in range(n, 1, -1):
        # If pouring from this bucket gives the exact effort or less, we perform the operation
        if e - (i - 1) >= 0:
            operations.append((i, 1))
            e -= (i - 1)
            # After pouring, we need to update the status for each bucket
            for j in range(i - 1, 0, -1):
                if buckets[j] == 1:
                    buckets[j] += buckets[i - 1]
                    buckets[i - 1] = 0
                    break
    
    # We need to check if we have met the exact effort required
    if e != 0:
        # If the exact effort is not met, the sequence is not valid
        return []
    
    return operations

# Read the input from 'galeti.in'
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file_in:
    n, e = map(int, file_in.readline().split())

# Get the sequence of operations
sequence = generate_sequence(n, e)

# Write the output to 'galeti.out'
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file_out:
    for op in sequence:
        file_out.write(f"{op[0]} {op[1]}\n")
```
```

In this code, the function `generate_sequence` takes the number of buckets and the effort required, and generates a list of operations that represent pouring water from one bucket to another. The algorithm starts from the last bucket and proceeds to pour into the first non-empty bucket to its left. After finding a valid sequence or determining that it's not possible, it writes the result to 'galeti.out'. This version does not use numpy, as it may not be necessary for managing the operations and could consume additional memory.
