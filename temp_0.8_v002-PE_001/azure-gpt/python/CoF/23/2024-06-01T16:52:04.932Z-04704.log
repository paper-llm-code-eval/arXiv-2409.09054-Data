Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.
* Pentru teste in valoare de `18` puncte datele de intrare sunt cunoscute. Mai precis:
Testul 0 : `n = 91, e = 90`
Testul 1 : `n = 30, e = 435`
Testul 2 : `n = 7, e = 16`
* Pentru alte teste in valoare de `15` puncte `n≤9`.

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python

# Read input data from file

# Main solving loop

        current_effort = e
        efforts.append((rightmost + 1, leftmost + 1))
        break

# If we couldn't achieve the exact effort, there's no solution
if current_effort != e:

# Write output data to file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as f:
    for eff in efforts:

```

Explanation:
- Read the input from `galeti.in`.
- Initialize the buckets array with 1s to represent the initial liter of water in each bucket.
- The `pour` function performs the action of pouring water from the right bucket to the left bucket and records the effort.
- The main loop attempts to pour water starting from the rightmost bucket that has water and is not the first bucket. The loop stops when all water is in the first bucket or when the exact required effort is reached.
- If the exact effort can't be reached, write "Impossible" in the output.
- Write the sequence of pours to `galeti.out`.

The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `numpy` is not available in the execution environment. Since the challenge specifies using highly efficient libraries whenever possible, but also considering the memory constraints, it might be better to solve this challenge without relying on external libraries, such as `numpy`. We can achieve this by using lists and careful memory management.

Let's rewrite the solution without `numpy`:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as f:
    n, e = map(int, f.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
buckets = [1] * n
efforts = []
current_effort = 0

# Function to perform the pouring according to the rules
def pour(i, j):
    global current_effort
    effort = buckets[i]
    buckets[j] += effort
    buckets[i] = 0
    current_effort += effort
    efforts.append((i + 1, j + 1))

# Main solving loop
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    if current_effort + buckets[i] <= e:
        pour(i, 0)
    else:
        pour(i, i - 1)
        break

# Continue pouring from the last non-empty bucket to the first one
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if buckets[i] > 0:
        pour(i, 0)

# Check if the exact effort has been achieved
if current_effort != e:
    efforts = [("Impossible",)]

# Write output data to file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as f:
    for eff in efforts:
        if eff == ("Impossible",):
            f.write("Impossible\n")
        else:
            f.write(f'{eff[0]} {eff[1]}\n')
```

This code follows the same logic but uses a list to store the current volume of each bucket and avoids using `numpy`. Now the solution should be compatible with any Python environment that doesn't have external libraries installed. It reads from `galeti.in`, performs the required operations while keeping track of the total effort, and writes the solution to `galeti.out`.

The provided solution does not handle the case where we need to make intermediate pours to achieve the exact required effort `e`. In the example provided with `4 4`, the following pours need to be made:

1. Pour from bucket 2 to bucket 1 (effort 1, total effort 1)
2. Pour from bucket 4 to bucket 3 (effort 1, total effort 2)
3. Pour from bucket 3 to bucket 1 (effort 2, total effort 4)

The solution did not consider that it might be necessary to pour from non-adjacent buckets to non-empty buckets to achieve the exact effort `e`. The solution only considered pouring into the first bucket or pouring from one bucket to its immediate left neighbor, which is not always the case for achieving the exact effort.

Let's rewrite the solution to consider these scenarios:

```python
# Define a function to perform the pouring operation
def pour(from_bucket, to_bucket, volume):
    # Pour volume from from_bucket to to_bucket
    global current_effort
    current_effort += volume
    efforts.append(f"{from_bucket + 1} {to_bucket + 1}\n")

# Read input data from file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
buckets = [1] * n  # Each bucket starts with 1 liter
current_effort = 0
efforts = []

# Perform the pours to move all water to the first bucket while tracking effort
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    if current_effort + (2 ** (i - 1)) > e:
        # If pouring all from bucket[i] to bucket[0] exceeds the effort,
        # pour into the next bucket to the left instead
        pour(i, i - 1, buckets[i])
    else:
        # Pour water to the first bucket, doubling its content repeatedly
        # as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number of pours
        for j in range(i):
            if buckets[j] > 0:
                pour(i, j, buckets[i])
                break

# Check if the exact effort has been achieved
if current_effort != e:
    efforts = ["Impossible\n"]

# Write output data to file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(efforts)
```

This updated solution uses a greedy approach. It starts from the rightmost bucket and attempts to double the contents of the buckets to the left whenever possible while ensuring the total effort does not exceed `e`. If pouring into the first bucket would exceed the effort, we pour into the nearest non-empty bucket to the left. This way, we keep the effort as close to `e` as possible without exceeding it. If, after all pours, the total effort equals `e`, we write the sequence of pours to `galeti.out`; otherwise, we write "Impossible".

The results differ because the implementation does not correctly account for the strategy needed to achieve the exact required effort, `e`. In the provided example, it is not sufficient to simply double the contents of buckets or always pour into the nearest non-empty bucket to the left. There needs to be a more strategic approach to ensure the exact effort `e` is met.

Let's correct the implementation to handle the example case and follow the rules:

1. Pour water from a bucket `i` to a bucket `j` only if all buckets between them are empty.
2. The effort is given by the amount of water in the bucket being poured.

To achieve the exact effort `e`, we need to reverse-engineer the process starting from the final state (all water in the first bucket) and working backward to determine which pours would result in the correct effort.

Rewrite the solution:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
pours = []  # Store the sequence of pours (i, j)
remaining_effort = e - (n - 1)  # Remaining effort after mandatory pours

# Reverse-engineer the process from the final state
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
    # Check if we can pour from bucket i to bucket 1
    if remaining_effort >= (1 << (i - 1)):
        pours.append((i, 1))
        remaining_effort -= (1 << (i - 1))
    else:
        pours.append((i, i + 1))

# If there is no remaining effort, the solution is valid
if remaining_effort != 0:
    pours = [("Impossible",)]

# Write output data to file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    for pour in pours:
        if pour == ("Impossible",):
            file.write("Impossible\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{pour[0]} {pour[1]}\n")
```

This solution constructs the sequence of pours by starting from the end and working backward. It calculates the mandatory effort needed to get all water to the first bucket and uses the remaining effort to decide how to pour the water efficiently. If there's not enough remaining effort to accomplish the task, it declares "Impossible". Otherwise, it writes the sequence of pours to `galeti.out`.

The results differ because the updated solution does not adhere to the specified rules for pouring buckets. The expected output indicates that the final pour should be from the last filled bucket directly to the first bucket, but the updated solution does not guarantee this. Additionally, the solution incorrectly handles the calculation of the remaining effort. 

To fix the issues, we should adjust the logic to correctly backtrack from the desired total effort `e` to determine the sequence of pours needed. We need to ensure that the pours are made according to the rule that any bucket between the source and destination buckets must be empty.

Here's the corrected algorithm in pseudocode before we write the Python code:

1. Start with the rightmost bucket (`n-1`) and try to pour into the leftmost bucket (`1`), only if it doesn't exceed the effort.
2. If the current bucket cannot be poured directly into the leftmost bucket without exceeding the effort, find the nearest bucket to the left that can be poured into.
3. If there is no valid bucket to pour into that satisfies the effort constraint, then the sequence is impossible.
4. Continue this process until all buckets have been poured into the leftmost bucket or an impossible state is reached.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
efforts = []
current_effort = 0

# Calculate the sequence of pours
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # If the current effort plus the volume of the current bucket is less than or equal to e
    # then we pour the current bucket into the first bucket
    if current_effort + (i - 1) <= e:
        efforts.append((i, 1))
        current_effort += (i - 1)
    # Otherwise, we pour the current bucket into the previous bucket
    else:
        efforts.append((i, i - 1))
        current_effort += 1

# Check if we achieved the exact effort
if current_effort != e:
    efforts = [("Impossible", "")]

# Write output data to file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    for eff in efforts:
        # If impossible, write "Impossible" to output file
        if eff == ("Impossible", ""):
            file.write("Impossible\n")
        else:
            # Write the efforts to the output file
            file.write(f"{eff[0]} {eff[1]}\n")
```

This solution takes a different approach than the previous attempts. It starts by trying to make the largest pours first (from right to left) and pours into the first bucket when possible. If pouring into the first bucket would exceed the effort `e`, it pours into the previous bucket instead, thereby only increasing the effort by `1`. Once all pours are complete, it checks if the total effort matches `e` and writes the sequence to `galeti.out`. If it is not possible to achieve the effort `e`, it writes "Impossible".

The difference between the expected and found result is due to the incorrect pouring sequence in the given solution. The expected result pours the second bucket into the first, then the fourth into the third, and finally the third into the first. This sequence maintains the rule that only non-empty buckets can have water poured into them and that any buckets between the two must be empty. The found output, however, pours the second bucket into the first, the third into the first (which is not allowed since the second bucket isn't empty), and then the fourth into the third. The order of pouring and the checks for empty intermediate buckets are not properly handled in the provided solution.

To fix the solution, we need to correctly calculate the sequence of pours. We start from the end and try to achieve the necessary effort by pouring from a bucket into the furthest possible non-empty bucket to its left (including the first bucket) without violating the rule. If the remaining effort is exactly 1 (the minimum possible effort for a pour), it must be poured into the nearest left bucket.

Let's implement the correct solution:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize variables
efforts = []
current_effort = 0

# Reverse-engineer the process from the final state
for i in range(n, 1, -1):
    # Check if we can pour from bucket i to bucket 1
    if current_effort + i - 1 <= e:
        efforts.append((i, 1))
        current_effort += i - 1
    # If not, pour into the nearest left bucket that is not empty
    else:
        efforts.append((i, i - 1))
        current_effort += 1

# Reverse the list of efforts to have them in ascending order
efforts.reverse()

# Check if the exact effort has been achieved
if current_effort != e:
    efforts = [("Impossible",)]

# Write output data to file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    for effort in efforts:
        if effort == ("Impossible",):
            file.write("Impossible\n")
        else:
            file.write(f"{effort[0]} {effort[1]}\n")
```

This solution starts with the end goal and works its way backward, pouring from the rightmost bucket to the farthest left bucket possible while respecting the rules and not exceeding the total effort `e`. It keeps pouring into the first bucket whenever it can until it reaches a case where doing so would exceed the total effort. In such cases, it pours into the nearest left bucket instead. Once the efforts have been calculated, they are reversed to be in the correct order and written to `galeti.out`. If the correct effort cannot be achieved, "Impossible" is written.

The provided solution incorrectly determines that the scenario is impossible, which is not the case according to the expected output. The error arises because the solution is not correctly backtracking from the required effort `e` to find a valid sequence of pours. It starts by pouring from the rightmost buckets and attempts to pour into the first bucket when possible, or into the nearest left bucket otherwise. This approach may not always lead to a valid sequence that exactly matches the required effort.

An appropriate strategy is to start pouring from the rightmost bucket and use a binary-like approach to double the water in the buckets we pour into until we reach or get close to the required effort. After that, we can make smaller pours to adjust the total effort precisely.

Let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
# Read input data from file
with open('galeti.in', 'r') as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Initialize the variables
efforts = []
current_effort = 0
bucket_contents = [1] * n

# Pouring function: pouring the contents of bucket i into bucket j
def pour(i, j):
    global current_effort
    efforts.append(f"{i + 1} {j + 1}\n")  # Add 1 to indices for 1-based numbering
    current_effort += bucket_contents[i]
    bucket_contents[j] += bucket_contents[i]
    bucket_contents[i] = 0

# Backtrack from the necessary effort e to find the sequence of pours
i = n - 1
while i > 0 and current_effort < e:
    # Find the nearest non-empty bucket to pour into
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and bucket_contents[j] == 0:
        j -= 1
    if j < 0:  # If no non-empty bucket is found, it's impossible
        break

    # Calculate the next pour
    if current_effort + bucket_contents[i] <= e:
        pour(i, j)
    i -= 1

# If it's not possible to reach the exact effort, we write "Impossible"
if current_effort != e:
    efforts = ["Impossible\n"]

# Write output to file
with open('galeti.out', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(efforts)
```

This solution begins with the last bucket and pours it into the nearest non-empty bucket to the left that doesn't cause the effort to exceed `e`. It continues this process until all buckets have been poured into or the total effort matches `e`. If the effort doesn't match `e`, it writes "Impossible" to the output file. Otherwise, it writes the sequence of pours to 'galeti.out' in the order they should be performed.
