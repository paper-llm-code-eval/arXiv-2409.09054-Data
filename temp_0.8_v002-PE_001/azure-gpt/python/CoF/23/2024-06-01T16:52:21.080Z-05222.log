Avem `n` găleți, numerotate de la stânga la dreapta cu numere de la `1` la `n`. Fiecare găleată conține inițial `1` litru de apă. Capacitatea fiecărei găleți este nelimitată. Vărsăm gălețile una în alta, respectând o anumită regulă, până când toată apa ajunge în prima găleată din stânga. Vărsarea unei găleți presupune un anumit efort.

Regula după care se răstoarnă gălețile este următoarea: se aleg două găleți astfel încât orice găleată situată între ele să fie goală. Se varsă apa din găleata din dreapta în găleata din stânga. Efortul depus este egal cu volumul de apă din găleata din dreapta ( cea care se varsă).

Formal, dacă notăm ai volumul de apă conținut în găleata cu numărul `i`, regula de vărsare a acestei găleți în găleata cu numărul `j` poate fi descrisă astfel:
1. `j<i`
2. $a_k=0$ pentru orice `k` astfel încât `j<k<i`
3. efortul depus este $a_i$
4. după vărsare $a_j=a_j+a_i$ și $a_i=0$

# Cerinţe
Cunoscând numărul de găleți `n` și un număr natural `e`, să se determine o succesiune de vărsări în urma căreia toată apa ajunge în găleata cea mai din stânga și efortul total depus este **exact** `e`.

# Date de intrare
Fișierul de intrare `galeti.in` conține pe prima linie două numere naturale, `n` și `e`, în această ordine, separate prin spațiu. Primul număr `n` reprezintă numărul de găleți. Al doilea număr `e` reprezintă efortul care trebuie depus pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga.

# Date de ieşire
Fișierul de ieșire `galeti.out` trebuie să conțină `n-1` linii care descriu vărsările, în ordinea în care acestea se efectuează, pentru a vărsa toată apa în găleata din stânga cu efortul total `e`. Fiecare dintre aceste linii trebuie să conțină două numere `i` și `j`, separate prin spațiu, cu semnificația că apa din găleata cu numărul `i` se varsă în găleata cu numărul `j`.

# Restricţii și precizări
* `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`
* `1 ≤ e ≤ 5 000 000 000`
* Se asigură că pentru datele de test există cel puțin o soluție posibilă,
* Dacă există mai multe soluții se poate afișa oricare dintre acestea.
* Punctajul maxim al problemei este de `100` de puncte dintre care `10` puncte din oficiu.
* Pentru teste in valoare de `18` puncte datele de intrare sunt cunoscute. Mai precis:
Testul 0 : `n = 91, e = 90`
Testul 1 : `n = 30, e = 435`
Testul 2 : `n = 7, e = 16`
* Pentru alte teste in valoare de `15` puncte `n≤9`.

# The function to write the sequence of pourings to the output file.

    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        for pouring in pourings:

# The function to find the sequence of pourings.
def find_pourings(n, e):
    # Initialize buckets with 1 liter of water each and an empty sequence of pourings.
    buckets = np.ones(n, dtype=np.int64)
    pourings = []

    # If we have only one bucket or no effort is needed, we return the empty sequence.
    if n == 1 or e == 0:
        return pourings

    # Calculate initial effort by pouring all buckets to the leftmost one.
    current_effort = np.sum(buckets) - 1
    
    # Check if the required effort is achievable.
    if e < current_effort:
        return None

    # Start pouring from the right-most bucket to the left, to achieve the required effort.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Calculate the difference in effort needed.
        diff = e - current_effort
        # Find the target bucket to pour into. The target bucket will have the amount of water that is a power of 2.
        target = max(1, i - (diff // buckets[i]))
        # Update the current effort as we pour the bucket i into the target.
        current_effort += buckets[i] * (i - target)
        # Pour the bucket.
        buckets[target] += buckets[i]
        buckets[i] = 0
        pourings.append((i + 1, target + 1))

        # If we've reached the required effort, stop here.
        if current_effort == e:
            break

    # If the current effort is not equal to the required effort after all pourings, return None.
    if current_effort != e:
        return None

    # Return the sequence of pourings.
    return pourings

# Read the input file to get the number of buckets and the required effort.
with open("galeti.in", "r") as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the sequence of pourings.
pourings = find_pourings(n, e)

# Write the sequence of pourings to the output file if the solution exists.
if pourings is not None and len(pourings) == n - 1:
    write_output(pourings)
else:
    with open("galeti.out", "w") as f:
        f.write("impossible\n")
```

This code reads input from `galeti.in`, computes a sequence of pourings to achieve the exact effort e, and writes the output to `galeti.out`. It utilizes the numpy library for efficient array handling and ensures that memory and time usage are optimized. The solution takes into account that the target bucket during each pouring must have a water volume that is a power of two to minimize the effort and maximize the efficiency of pourings. If the desired effort cannot be achieved, the code will write "impossible" to the output file.

The error message indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Since the challenge requires us to optimize memory and we have a memory limit of ~8MB, it's not recommended to use `numpy` or any such libraries that could consume more memory than the allowed limit. Instead, we should rely on built-in Python data structures and algorithms to achieve the desired optimization.

Here's the revised solution without the use of `numpy`:

```python
# The function to write the sequence of pourings to the output file.
def write_output(pourings, filename="galeti.out"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        for pouring in pourings:
            f.write(f"{pouring[0]} {pouring[1]}\n")

# The function to find the sequence of pourings.
def find_pourings(n, e):
    # Initialize buckets with 1 liter of water each and an empty sequence of pourings.
    buckets = [1] * n
    pourings = []

    # If we have only one bucket or no effort is needed, we return the empty sequence.
    if n == 1 or e == 0:
        return pourings

    # Calculate initial effort by pouring all buckets to the leftmost one.
    current_effort = sum(buckets) - 1

    # Check if the required effort is achievable.
    if e < current_effort:
        return None

    # Start pouring from the right-most bucket to the left, to achieve the required effort.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Calculate the difference in effort needed.
        diff = e - current_effort
        # Find the target bucket to pour into.
        target = max(1, i - diff)
        # Update the current effort as we pour the bucket i into the target.
        current_effort += buckets[i] * (i - target)
        # Pour the bucket.
        buckets[target] += buckets[i]
        buckets[i] = 0
        pourings.append((i + 1, target + 1))

        # If we've reached the required effort, stop here.
        if current_effort == e:
            break

    # If the current effort is not equal to the required effort after all pourings, return None.
    if current_effort != e:
        return None

    # Return the sequence of pourings.
    return pourings

# Read the input file to get the number of buckets and the required effort.
with open("galeti.in", "r") as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the sequence of pourings.
pourings = find_pourings(n, e)

# Write the sequence of pourings to the output file if the solution exists.
if pourings is not None and len(pourings) == n - 1:
    write_output(pourings)
else:
    with open("galeti.out", "w") as f:
        f.write("impossible\n")
```

This solution does not use the `numpy` library and relies on Python's built-in list data structure to keep track of the volume of water in each bucket. The logic remains the same as in the previous solution, but it should now be more memory-efficient.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, we need to revisit the algorithm to ensure that the conditions for pouring buckets and the logic for calculating the effort are correctly implemented.

The current implementation does not correctly calculate the target bucket to pour into. The main issue lies in the line `target = max(1, i - diff)`, as it fails to take into account that the target bucket must have a water volume that is a power of two. 

Here's the corrected and optimized solution:

```python
def write_output(pourings, filename="galeti.out"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        for pouring in pourings:
            f.write(f"{pouring[0]} {pouring[1]}\n")

def find_pourings(n, e):
    pourings = []
    current_effort = 0
    powers_of_two = [2 ** i for i in range(n) if 2 ** i <= n]

    # We will attempt to make the sequence of buckets after pouring look like [e, 0, 0, ..., 0]
    # and then pour all buckets into the first one, step by step.
    for power in reversed(powers_of_two):
        if current_effort + power > e:
            continue
        while current_effort + power <= e and n > 1:
            pour_from = power
            while pour_from < n:
                pourings.append((pour_from + 1, pour_from // 2 + 1))
                current_effort += power
                pour_from *= 2
            n = power

    if current_effort != e:
        return None

    return pourings

# Read the input file to get the number of buckets and the required effort.
with open("galeti.in", "r") as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the sequence of pourings.
pourings = find_pourings(n, e)

# Write the sequence of pourings to the output file if the solution exists.
if pourings is not None:
    write_output(pourings)
else:
    with open("galeti.out", "w") as f:
        f.write("impossible\n")
```

This solution involves creating a sequence of buckets that will look like `[e, 0, 0, ..., 0]` after pouring, with the total effort matching exactly `e`. We then simulate pouring the buckets into the first one, ensuring that each pouring happens from a bucket that will result in a power of two volume being moved to the leftmost bucket. If we are unable to reach the exact total effort `e`, we write "impossible" to the output file.

Exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed because it exceeded the memory usage limit or because it was terminated by the operating system due to other system constraints. Since there is no standard error or output, it is hard to pinpoint the exact cause. However, the code could be exceeding the memory limit due to the creation of the `powers_of_two` list, which could be large if `n` is large.

We can remove the pre-computation of powers of two and instead calculate them on the fly, which would use less memory. Here is the reworked solution without pre-computing the powers of two:

```python
# The function to write the sequence of pourings to the output file.
def write_output(pourings, filename="galeti.out"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        for pouring in pourings:
            f.write(f"{pouring[0]} {pouring[1]}\n")

# The function to find the sequence of pourings.
def find_pourings(n, e):
    # Initialize the sequence of pourings.
    pourings = []
    # The volume of water in each bucket starting from the second bucket.
    volume = 1
    # The index of the current bucket to pour from.
    current_bucket = n

    # Calculate the sequence of pourings.
    while e > 0 and current_bucket > 1:
        # Check if we can pour from the current bucket.
        if e >= volume:
            # Pour from the current bucket to the previous bucket that is not empty.
            target_bucket = current_bucket // 2
            pourings.append((current_bucket, target_bucket))
            # Subtract the volume of water poured from the effort.
            e -= volume
            # The next pour should happen from the bucket we just poured into.
            current_bucket = target_bucket
        else:
            # Move to the next bucket to the left for the next pouring.
            current_bucket -= 1
            # Double the volume of water for the next bucket.
            volume *= 2

    # Check if we have achieved the exact effort.
    if e != 0:
        return None

    # Return the sequence of pourings.
    return pourings

# Read the input file to get the number of buckets and the required effort.
with open("galeti.in", "r") as file:
    n, e = map(int, file.readline().split())

# Find the sequence of pourings.
pourings = find_pourings(n, e)

# Write the sequence of pourings to the output file if the solution exists.
if pourings is not None:
    write_output(pourings)
else:
    with open("galeti.out", "w") as f:
        f.write("impossible\n")
```

This solution does not pre-compute the powers of two and instead calculates them on the fly, which should prevent it from running out of memory. It starts from the last bucket and attempts to pour into the first non-empty bucket to its left, ensuring that we get the exact effort needed when all the pours are complete. If it is not possible to achieve the exact effort, it writes "impossible" to the output file.
