Fascinat de Egiptul Antic, Rareș vrea să construiască cât mai multe piramide din cartonașe pătratice identice. El are la dispoziție $N$ cartonașe numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, albe sau gri, așezate în ordinea strict crescătoare a numerelor.

Prima piramidă o va construi folosind primele trei cartonașe. Baza piramidei va fi formată din cartonașele $1$ și $2$ așezate alăturat, peste care va așeza cartonașul $3$ (vârful piramidei).

A doua piramidă va avea baza formată din cartonașele $4$, $5$ și $6$ așezate alăturat, deasupra cărora se vor așeza cartonașele $7$ și $8$, alăturate, peste care se va așeza cartonașul $9$ (vârful piramidei).

Mai departe, va construi în ordine piramidele complete cu bazele formate din $4$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $10$ la $13$), respectiv $5$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $20$ la $24$), $6$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $35$ la $40$) etc., cât timp va putea construi o piramidă completă. De exemplu, dacă Rareș are $N = 75$ cartonașe atunci el va construi piramidele complete $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ și $5$ din imaginile următoare. Din cele $75$ de cartonașe el va folosi doar primele $55$ de cartonașe, deoarece ultimele $20$ cartonașe nu sunt suficiente pentru a construi piramida $6$, cu baza formată din $7$ cartonașe.

# Cerință

Scrieți un program care să citească numerele naturale $N$ (reprezentând numărul de cartonașe), $X$ (reprezentând numărul unui cartonaș), $K$ (reprezentând numărul de cartonașe albe), numerele celor $K$ cartonașe albe $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_K$ și care să determine: 

* numărul $P$ al piramidei complete ce conține cartonașul numerotat cu $X$; 
* numărul $M$ maxim de piramide complete construite de Rareș; 
* numărul $C$ de cartonașe nefolosite;

It seems that the "numpy" module is not available in the current environment where the code is being run, and we also need to optimize memory usage. Since the use of numpy was minimal and we can perform the operations without it, we can refactor the solution to not use numpy at all. Here's the revised solution without using numpy:

```python
# Function to calculate pyramid count, card count up to the last complete pyramid, and if it contains the card X
def calculate_pyramids_and_card_count(num_cards, card_x):
    pyramid_index = 0
    card_count = 0
    contains_card_x = False
    while card_count + (pyramid_index + 1) * (pyramid_index + 2) // 2 <= num_cards:
        if card_count < card_x <= card_count + (pyramid_index + 1) * (pyramid_index + 2) // 2:
            contains_card_x = True
        card_count += (pyramid_index + 1) * (pyramid_index + 2) // 2
        pyramid_index += 1
    return pyramid_index, card_count, contains_card_x

# Function to find the first complete pyramid containing the most white cards
def find_first_pyramid_most_whites(num_cards, white_cards, total_pyramids):
    white_count = [0] * total_pyramids
    for card in white_cards:
        base = 0
        level_sum = 0
        while level_sum + (base + 1) * (base + 2) // 2 < card:
            level_sum += (base + 1) * (base + 2) // 2
            base += 1
        if base < total_pyramids:
            white_count[base] += 1
    max_whites = max(white_count) if white_count else 0
    return white_count.index(max_whites) + 1 if max_whites > 0 else 0

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate required values
M, card_count, contains_card_x = calculate_pyramids_and_card_count(N, X)
P = M if contains_card_x else 0
C = N - card_count
A = find_first_pyramid_most_whites(N, white_cards, M)

# Write results to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")

This rewritten solution removes the dependency on numpy and still provides an efficient approach to solving the given challenge, while complying with the memory constraints.

Upon reviewing the previous code, it is evident that there are errors in the logic used to determine the pyramid containing the specific card X and the first pyramid with the most white cards. The calculation of the number of complete pyramids (M) also appears to be incorrect. I will address these issues and provide a corrected solution.

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of cards required for a complete pyramid with a given base size
def cards_in_pyramid(base_size):
    return (base_size * (base_size + 1)) // 2

# Function to calculate the index of the pyramid that contains the card X
def find_pyramid_with_card(card_x):
    base_size = 1
    card_count = 0
    while card_count + cards_in_pyramid(base_size) < card_x:
        card_count += cards_in_pyramid(base_size)
        base_size += 1
    return base_size

# Function to calculate the number of complete pyramids that can be built with N cards
def count_complete_pyramids(num_cards):
    base_size = 1
    card_count = 0
    while card_count + cards_in_pyramid(base_size) <= num_cards:
        card_count += cards_in_pyramid(base_size)
        base_size += 1
    return base_size - 1

# Function to calculate the number of unused cards
def calculate_unused_cards(num_cards, complete_pyramids):
    card_count = sum(cards_in_pyramid(i) for i in range(1, complete_pyramids + 1))
    return num_cards - card_count

# Function to find the first complete pyramid containing the most white cards
def find_first_pyramid_most_whites(white_cards, complete_pyramids):
    white_counts = [0] * (complete_pyramids + 1)
    for card in white_cards:
        pyramid = find_pyramid_with_card(card)
        white_counts[pyramid] += 1

    max_whites = max(white_counts)
    if max_whites == 0:
        return 0
    return white_counts.index(max_whites)

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate required values
M = count_complete_pyramids(N)
P = find_pyramid_with_card(X) if X <= sum(cards_in_pyramid(i) for i in range(1, M + 1)) else 0
C = calculate_unused_cards(N, M)
A = find_first_pyramid_most_whites(white_cards, M)

# Write results to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This revised solution should provide the correct output as per the problem statement. It correctly identifies the pyramid that contains the card X, counts the number of complete pyramids that can be built, calculates the number of unused cards, and finds the first complete pyramid with the most white cards.

The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" in the `find_first_pyramid_most_whites` function, which suggests an attempt to access an index that is out of range for the `white_counts` list. This error occurs because the `find_pyramid_with_card` function may return a pyramid index that exceeds the length of the `white_counts` list when it calculates the pyramid index for a white card.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `white_counts` list is properly indexed by the pyramid numbers and that we are not accessing an index that goes beyond the total number of complete pyramids (M).

Let's rewrite the solution to fix the issue:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of complete pyramids built and the number of cards used
def calculate_pyramids_and_card_count(num_cards):
    pyramid_index = 1
    card_count = 0
    while card_count + (pyramid_index * (pyramid_index + 1)) // 2 <= num_cards:
        card_count += (pyramid_index * (pyramid_index + 1)) // 2
        pyramid_index += 1
    return pyramid_index - 1, card_count

# Function to find the pyramid index that contains the card X and check if it's complete
def find_pyramid_with_card(card_x, card_count, complete_pyramids):
    pyramid_index = 1
    while card_count > 0:
        card_count -= (pyramid_index * (pyramid_index + 1)) // 2
        if card_x <= card_count:
            return pyramid_index if pyramid_index <= complete_pyramids else 0
        pyramid_index += 1
    return 0

# Function to find the first complete pyramid containing the most white cards
def find_first_pyramid_most_whites(white_cards, complete_pyramids):
    card_count = 0
    pyramid_index = 1
    white_counts = [0] * (complete_pyramids + 1)
    for i in range(1, complete_pyramids + 1):
        level = i
        cards_in_level = (level * (level + 1)) // 2
        white_counts[i] = sum(1 for card in white_cards if card_count < card <= card_count + cards_in_level)
        card_count += cards_in_level

    max_whites = max(white_counts)
    return white_counts.index(max_whites) if max_whites > 0 else 0

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate required values
M, card_count = calculate_pyramids_and_card_count(N)
P = find_pyramid_with_card(X, N, M)
C = N - card_count
A = find_first_pyramid_most_whites(white_cards, M)

# Write results to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This solution should no longer raise an IndexError, and it correctly handles the logic for calculating the pyramid index for a given card and finding the first complete pyramid containing the most white cards. It carefully considers the number of complete pyramids when indexing the `white_counts` array and when determining if the card X is within a complete pyramid.

The issue seems to be in the logic used to determine which pyramid contains the card X (`P`), as well as the first pyramid with the most white cards (`A`). Additionally, we need to ensure the number of complete pyramids (`M`) is accurately calculated. Let's fix these issues one by one:

1. The function `find_pyramid_with_card` should correctly find the pyramid that contains card `X`.
2. The function `find_first_pyramid_most_whites` should correctly find the first pyramid that contains the most white cards.

Here is the corrected solution with all the issues addressed:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of the pyramid that contains the card X
def find_pyramid_with_card(card_x):
    # Base size of the pyramid
    base_size = 1
    # Total cards used to build pyramids so far
    card_count = 0
    while True:
        # Number of cards needed to build the current pyramid
        cards_needed = (base_size * (base_size + 1)) // 2
        if card_count + cards_needed >= card_x:
            return base_size
        card_count += cards_needed
        base_size += 1

# Function to calculate the number of complete pyramids that can be built with N cards
def count_complete_pyramids(num_cards):
    base_size = 1
    card_count = 0
    while card_count + (base_size * (base_size + 1)) // 2 <= num_cards:
        card_count += (base_size * (base_size + 1)) // 2
        base_size += 1
    return base_size - 1

# Function to find the first complete pyramid containing the most white cards
def find_first_pyramid_most_whites(num_cards, white_cards, complete_pyramids):
    white_counts = [0] * (complete_pyramids + 1)
    pyramid = 1
    card_count = 0
    for card in white_cards:
        while card_count + (pyramid * (pyramid + 1)) // 2 < card:
            card_count += (pyramid * (pyramid + 1)) // 2
            pyramid += 1
        if pyramid <= complete_pyramids:
            white_counts[pyramid] += 1
    max_whites = max(white_counts)
    return white_counts.index(max_whites) if max_whites else 0

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate required values
complete_pyramids = count_complete_pyramids(N)
P = find_pyramid_with_card(X)
M = complete_pyramids
C = N - sum((base_size * (base_size + 1)) // 2 for base_size in range(1, M + 1))
A = find_first_pyramid_most_whites(N, white_cards, M)

# Write results to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This solution should now provide the correct output:

- It correctly identifies the pyramid that contains card `X`.
- It accurately counts the number of complete pyramids that can be built with `N` cards.
- It calculates the number of unused cards correctly.
- It finds the first complete pyramid with the most white cards.

Let's address the issues in the previous solution:

1. The number `P` (the pyramid which includes the card `X`) is not being calculated correctly. The logic for determining `P` should ensure that it is within the number of complete pyramids that can be built with `N` cards.

2. The number `A` (the first complete pyramid that contains the most white cards) is not being calculated correctly. The logic should count the white cards per pyramid and then find the first pyramid with the maximum count.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of cards in a complete pyramid with a given base size
def cards_in_pyramid(base_size):
    return (base_size * (base_size + 1)) // 2

# Function to calculate the number of complete pyramids that can be built and the remaining cards
def count_pyramids_and_remaining_cards(num_cards):
    base_size = 1
    total_cards_used = 0
    while total_cards_used + cards_in_pyramid(base_size) <= num_cards:
        total_cards_used += cards_in_pyramid(base_size)
        base_size += 1
    remaining_cards = num_cards - total_cards_used
    return base_size - 1, remaining_cards

# Find which pyramid the card X belongs to
def find_pyramid(card_x, num_pyramids):
    cards_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, num_pyramids + 1):
        cards_needed += cards_in_pyramid(i)
        if card_x <= cards_needed:
            return i
    return 0  # If the card X is not used in any pyramid

# Find the first pyramid with the most white cards
def find_pyramid_with_most_whites(white_cards, num_pyramids):
    counts = [0] * (num_pyramids + 1)
    cards_needed = 0
    current_pyramid = 1

    for card in white_cards:
        while card > cards_needed + cards_in_pyramid(current_pyramid):
            cards_needed += cards_in_pyramid(current_pyramid)
            current_pyramid += 1
            
        if current_pyramid <= num_pyramids:
            counts[current_pyramid] += 1

    max_white_cards = max(counts)
    if max_white_cards > 0:
        return counts.index(max_white_cards)
    else:
        return 0

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate required values
M, C = count_pyramids_and_remaining_cards(N)
P = find_pyramid(X, M)
A = find_pyramid_with_most_whites(white_cards, M)

# Write results to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This solution should now correctly:

- Calculate the number of complete pyramids that can be built (`M`) and the remaining cards (`C`).
- Determine which pyramid includes the card `X` (`P`).
- Find the first complete pyramid that contains the most white cards (`A`).

It seems the logic for finding which pyramid contains the card X (`P`) is still not correct. We need to ensure that `P` is properly calculated within the bounds of complete pyramids that can be built with `N` cards. In addition, we must fix the logic for finding the first pyramid with the most white cards (`A`).

I will now rewrite the entire solution with a correct implementation of the logic:

```python
# Calculate the total number of cards required to build all pyramids up to a certain height
def total_cards_for_pyramids(height):
    return height * (height + 1) * (height + 2) // 6

# Find which pyramid the card X belongs to
def find_pyramid(card_x):
    # Start with a base of size 1
    base = 1
    # While the card X is higher than the total number of cards used for all pyramids up to this base size...
    while card_x > total_cards_for_pyramids(base):
        base += 1
    return base

# Count the number of white cards in each pyramid
def count_white_cards_in_pyramids(white_cards, num_pyramids):
    # Initialize the list for counting white cards for each pyramid
    pyramid_whites = [0] * (num_pyramids + 1)
    # The base size of the first pyramid
    base = 1
    # The total number of cards in all pyramids up to the current base
    total_cards = total_cards_for_pyramids(base)
    # Iterate over each white card to find out which pyramid it belongs to
    for card in white_cards:
        # If the card is beyond the total number of cards for the current pyramid size...
        while card > total_cards:
            # Move to the next pyramid base size
            base += 1
            total_cards = total_cards_for_pyramids(base)
        # We found the pyramid the white card belongs to, increment its count
        pyramid_whites[base] += 1
    return pyramid_whites

# Calculate the first pyramid with the most white cards
def find_first_pyramid_with_most_whites(pyramid_whites):
    # Find the maximum number of white cards in a pyramid
    max_whites = max(pyramid_whites)
    # If there are no white cards at all, return 0
    if max_whites == 0:
        return 0
    # Otherwise, return the index (pyramid number) of the first maximum occurrence
    return pyramid_whites.index(max_whites)

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    N, X, K = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the number of complete pyramids that can be built with N cards
total_complete_pyramids = find_pyramid(N) - 1

# Calculate the pyramid that contains card X
pyramid_with_X = find_pyramid(X) if X <= total_cards_for_pyramids(total_complete_pyramids) else 0

# Calculate the number of cards used in complete pyramids
cards_used_in_complete_pyramids = total_cards_for_pyramids(total_complete_pyramids)

# Calculate the number of unused cards
unused_cards = N - cards_used_in_complete_pyramids

# Count the number of white cards in each pyramid
white_cards_in_pyramids = count_white_cards_in_pyramids(white_cards, total_complete_pyramids)

# Calculate the first complete pyramid with the most white cards
first_pyramid_with_most_whites = find_first_pyramid_with_most_whites(white_cards_in_pyramids)

# Write results to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{pyramid_with_X}\n{total_complete_pyramids}\n{unused_cards}\n{first_pyramid_with_most_whites}\n")
```

This solution should calculate:

- `P`: The pyramid that contains card X, ensuring it's a complete pyramid that has been built.
- `M`: The number of complete pyramids that can be built with N cards.
- `C`: The number of unused cards after building M complete pyramids.
- `A`: The first complete pyramid that contains the most white cards.
