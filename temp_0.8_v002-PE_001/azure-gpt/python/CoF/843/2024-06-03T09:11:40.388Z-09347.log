Fascinat de Egiptul Antic, Rareș vrea să construiască cât mai multe piramide din cartonașe pătratice identice. El are la dispoziție $N$ cartonașe numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, albe sau gri, așezate în ordinea strict crescătoare a numerelor.

Prima piramidă o va construi folosind primele trei cartonașe. Baza piramidei va fi formată din cartonașele $1$ și $2$ așezate alăturat, peste care va așeza cartonașul $3$ (vârful piramidei).

A doua piramidă va avea baza formată din cartonașele $4$, $5$ și $6$ așezate alăturat, deasupra cărora se vor așeza cartonașele $7$ și $8$, alăturate, peste care se va așeza cartonașul $9$ (vârful piramidei).

Mai departe, va construi în ordine piramidele complete cu bazele formate din $4$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $10$ la $13$), respectiv $5$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $20$ la $24$), $6$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $35$ la $40$) etc., cât timp va putea construi o piramidă completă. De exemplu, dacă Rareș are $N = 75$ cartonașe atunci el va construi piramidele complete $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ și $5$ din imaginile următoare. Din cele $75$ de cartonașe el va folosi doar primele $55$ de cartonașe, deoarece ultimele $20$ cartonașe nu sunt suficiente pentru a construi piramida $6$, cu baza formată din $7$ cartonașe.

Since the environment does not have the `numpy` module available and we have a strict memory limitation, we need to adapt the solution to not use `numpy`. We can use standard Python lists and other basic operations to handle the operations needed. Here is the revised solution without using `numpy`.

The program output is incorrect due to a logical error in the `find_piramid` function where we calculate the total cards in a pyramid incorrectly when determining `P`. Also, the `C` value calculation is not accurately reflecting the number of unused cards after building as many complete pyramids as possible. Let's correct the logic:

The total number of cards needed to build a pyramid with a base `b` is `(b * (b + 1)) // 2`. We can use this formula iteratively to find the largest pyramid size that can be built with `N` cards (`M` pyramid size) and also to check if the card `X` is within a complete pyramid (`P` pyramid size). 

Additionally, the function `find_piramid_with_most_white` has a logical error where it does not correctly map the card numbers to the pyramid indices they belong to.

We will correct these logical errors and rewrite the solution.

```python
def find_piramid(N, X):
    total_cards = 0
    base = 1
    while total_cards + (base * (base + 1)) // 2 <= N:
        total_cards += (base * (base + 1)) // 2
        base += 1
    M = base - 1  # Adjustment since the last increment does not build a full pyramid
    
    # Determine P, the pyramid that contains card X
    total_cards = 0

Upon re-evaluating the solution, there seems to be an error in the calculation of `P` and `C`. We must correctly calculate the pyramid level `P` that contains card `X` and the number of unused cards `C` after the last complete pyramid.

For `P`, we need to find the total cards used up to and including the level that `X` would be on. We'll iterate and add the number of cards in each level until we reach or pass `X`. The level at which this happens is the level of pyramid `P`.

For `C`, after we find `M` (the largest complete pyramid that can be built), we need to subtract the total number of cards used from `N` to get the number of unused cards.

The function `find_piramid_with_most_white` also needs to be fixed to correctly calculate `A`, the pyramid with the most white cards. We'll map each card number to its pyramid level as we count the white cards.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
def calculate_piramid_levels(N):
    # Calculate the total cards used by complete pyramids and the corresponding levels
    level = 1
    total_cards = 0
    while True:
        cards_this_level = (level * (level + 1)) // 2
        if total_cards + cards_this_level > N:
            break
        total_cards += cards_this_level
        level += 1
    return level, total_cards

def find_piramid_with_most_white(white_cards, level_card_mapping):
    white_cards_in_piramids = [0] * (max(level_card_mapping.values()) + 1)

            white_cards_in_piramids[level_card_mapping[white_card]] += 1
    max_white_cards = max(white_cards_in_piramids)

max_level, total_cards_by_max_level = calculate_piramid_levels(N)
level_card_mapping = {}
current_card = 1

# Map cards to their pyramid levels

    current_card += cards_in_level

# Find P, the level of the pyramid containing card X
P = level_card_mapping.get(X, 0)

# M is simply the maximum complete level
M = max_level - 1

# C is the number of cards left after the last complete pyramid

Upon reviewing the code, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation of the pyramid level that contains card `X` and the pyramid with the most white cards. The approach to map each card to its pyramid level seems correct, but there's likely an off-by-one error in the logic that's causing incorrect output.

Let's fix the off-by-one error in the `P` calculation and properly compute the pyramid with the most white cards. For `P`, we'll start with a base of size 2 and keep adding the number of cards needed for the next pyramid level until we reach or pass `X`. For `A`, we'll track the white card count for each pyramid level and choose the one with the most white cards.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the pyramid which includes card X and calculate P, M, and C
def find_piramid(X, N):
    base = 2
    total_cards = 3
    while total_cards + (base * (base + 1)) // 2 <= N:
        base += 1
        total_cards += (base * (base + 1)) // 2
    M = base - 1
    P = 0
    pyramid_card_count = 0
    for b in range(2, M + 2):
        pyramid_card_count += (b * (b + 1)) // 2
        if X <= pyramid_card_count:
            P = b - 1
            break
    C = N - pyramid_card_count if pyramid_card_count <= N else N - (pyramid_card_count - ((M + 1) * (M + 2)) // 2)
    return P, M, C


# Function to find the first complete pyramid with the most white cards
def find_piramid_with_most_white(white_cards, M):
    white_card_distribution = [0] * (M + 1)
    card_number = 1
    for base in range(2, M + 2):
        cards_in_this_piramid = (base * (base + 1)) // 2
        for card in range(card_number, card_number + cards_in_this_piramid):
            if card in white_cards:
                white_card_distribution[base - 1] += 1
        card_number += cards_in_this_piramid

    max_white_cards = max(white_card_distribution)
    if max_white_cards == 0:
        return 0

    return white_card_distribution.index(max_white_cards) + 1  # +1 since we're using zero-based indexing

# Read input data
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as f:
    N, X, K = map(int, f.readline().split())
    white_cards = set(map(int, f.readline().split()))

# Process the data
P, M, C = find_piramid(X, N)
A = find_piramid_with_most_white(white_cards, M) if K > 0 else 0

# Write output data
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n')
```

This should now produce the correct result:

- `P` is the level of the pyramid that contains the card `X`.
- `M` is the number of complete pyramids that can be built with `N` cards.
- `C` is the number of cards left after the last complete pyramid.
- `A` is the first complete pyramid that contains the most white cards.

The error in the previous solution seems to be in the calculation of the number of unused cards `C`. We must ensure we're only subtracting the total number of cards used in the complete pyramids up to the maximum full pyramid `M` that can be built. The previous solution incorrectly subtracted the cards up to the attempted pyramid that could not be completed.

Additionally, the pyramid with the most white cards `A` seems to be calculated incorrectly. We should iterate over all the pyramids that can fully be built and count the number of white cards in each to determine `A`.

Let's correct the solution by accurately calculating `C` and iterating correctly to find `A`.

```python
# Function to calculate the card counts of each complete pyramid level
def calculate_card_counts(N):
    card_counts = []
    total_cards = 0
    base = 1
    while True:
        base += 1
        cards_this_level = (base * (base + 1)) // 2
        if total_cards + cards_this_level > N:
            break
        total_cards += cards_this_level
        card_counts.append(cards_this_level)
    return card_counts

# Function to find the complete pyramid containing card X and other output values
def find_piramid(N, X, card_counts):
    total_cards_used = 0
    for i, count in enumerate(card_counts, start=2):
        total_cards_used += count
        if X <= total_cards_used:
            P = i
            break
    else:
        P = 0

    M = i if P else i - 1
    C = N - total_cards_used + card_counts[-1] if P else N - total_cards_used
    return P, M, C

# Function to determine the pyramid with the most white cards
def find_piramid_with_most_white(white_cards, card_counts):
    white_count_per_piramid = [0] * len(card_counts)
    current_card = 1
    for i, count in enumerate(card_counts):
        for card in range(current_card, current_card + count):
            if card in white_cards:
                white_count_per_piramid[i] += 1
        current_card += count
    
    max_white = max(white_count_per_piramid)
    if max_white == 0:
        return 0
    return white_count_per_piramid.index(max_white) + 2  # +2 to adjust for 1-based index and start from pyramid 2

# Read input data
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as f:
    N, X, K = map(int, f.readline().split())
    white_cards = set(map(int, f.readline().split()))

# Calculate the card counts for complete pyramids
card_counts = calculate_card_counts(N)

# Process the data to find P, M, and C
P, M, C = find_piramid(N, X, card_counts)

# Find the pyramid A with the most white cards
A = find_piramid_with_most_white(white_cards, card_counts) if K > 0 else 0

# Write output data
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n')
```
