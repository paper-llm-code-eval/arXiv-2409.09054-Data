Fascinat de Egiptul Antic, Rareș vrea să construiască cât mai multe piramide din cartonașe pătratice identice. El are la dispoziție $N$ cartonașe numerotate de la $1$ la $N$, albe sau gri, așezate în ordinea strict crescătoare a numerelor.

Prima piramidă o va construi folosind primele trei cartonașe. Baza piramidei va fi formată din cartonașele $1$ și $2$ așezate alăturat, peste care va așeza cartonașul $3$ (vârful piramidei).

A doua piramidă va avea baza formată din cartonașele $4$, $5$ și $6$ așezate alăturat, deasupra cărora se vor așeza cartonașele $7$ și $8$, alăturate, peste care se va așeza cartonașul $9$ (vârful piramidei).

Mai departe, va construi în ordine piramidele complete cu bazele formate din $4$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $10$ la $13$), respectiv $5$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $20$ la $24$), $6$ cartonașe (cu numerele de la $35$ la $40$) etc., cât timp va putea construi o piramidă completă. De exemplu, dacă Rareș are $N = 75$ cartonașe atunci el va construi piramidele complete $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ și $5$ din imaginile următoare. Din cele $75$ de cartonașe el va folosi doar primele $55$ de cartonașe, deoarece ultimele $20$ cartonașe nu sunt suficiente pentru a construi piramida $6$, cu baza formată din $7$ cartonașe.

    pyramid_base = 1
    while total_cards + (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2 <= n:
        total_cards += (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2
        pyramid_base += 1
    max_pyramids = pyramid_base - 1
    unused_cards = n - total_cards
    return max_pyramids, unused_cards

# Function to find the first pyramid with the most white cards
def find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, max_pyramids):
    white_cards_in_pyramids = np.zeros(max_pyramids + 1, dtype=np.int32)
    pyramid_base = 1
    pyramid_number = 1
    current_card = 1
    
    for card in white_cards:
        while card >= current_card + (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2:
            pyramid_number += 1
            current_card += (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2
            pyramid_base += 1
        white_cards_in_pyramids[pyramid_number] += 1
        
    most_white_cards = np.argmax(white_cards_in_pyramids)
    if white_cards_in_pyramids[most_white_cards] == 0:
        return 0
    return most_white_cards

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data
P = find_pyramid_number(x)
M, C = calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n)

# Write output to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This solution reads from `piramide.in` and writes to `piramide.out`, meeting the stated efficiency requirements. The complexity of the function `find_pyramid_number` is approximately O(sqrt(X)), `calculate_pyramids_and_unused` is O(sqrt(N)) and `find_pyramid_with_most_white` is O(K) where K is the number of white cards. The memory usage should be well within the limits as it uses only a few simple data structures, and the largest one is an array with size proportional to the number of pyramids which is much less than N.

The code failed to execute because the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where it was run. To fix the program, we can either remove the dependency on `numpy` and use built-in Python data structures and functions or ensure that `numpy` is installed in the environment. Since the memory limit is strict and `numpy` might not be allowed due to the environment constraints, I'll rewrite the solution without using `numpy`.

Here is the complete solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Function to find the pyramid number that contains the card X
def find_pyramid_number(x):
    n = 1
    total_cards = 0
    while True:
        cards_in_pyramid = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
        total_cards += cards_in_pyramid
        if total_cards >= x:
            return n
        n += 1
    return 0

# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete pyramids and unused cards
def calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n):
    total_cards = 0
    pyramid_base = 1
    while total_cards + (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2 <= n:
        total_cards += (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2
        pyramid_base += 1
    max_pyramids = pyramid_base - 1
    unused_cards = n - total_cards
    return max_pyramids, unused_cards

# Function to find the first pyramid with the most white cards
def find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, max_pyramids):
    white_cards_in_pyramids = [0] * (max_pyramids + 1)
    pyramid_base = 1
    pyramid_number = 1
    current_card = 1
    
    for card in white_cards:
        while card >= current_card + (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2:
            pyramid_number += 1
            current_card += (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2
            pyramid_base += 1
        white_cards_in_pyramids[pyramid_number] += 1
        
    most_white_cards = max(enumerate(white_cards_in_pyramids), key=lambda x: x[1])
    if most_white_cards[1] == 0:
        return 0
    return most_white_cards[0]

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data
P = find_pyramid_number(x)
M, C = calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n)
A = find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, M)

# Write output to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This solution uses built-in Python lists instead of `numpy` arrays and the `max` function with a `lambda` to find the index of the first pyramid with the most white cards. The rest of the code remains unchanged from the previous solution.

The error `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the `find_pyramid_with_most_white` function is attempting to access an index of the `white_cards_in_pyramids` list that does not exist. This is likely due to the `pyramid_number` being incremented beyond the length of the `white_cards_in_pyramids` list.

We will need to adjust the bounds check within the loop to ensure that the `pyramid_number` does not exceed the length of our list. I'll also make sure that we handle the case where there are no white cards in any pyramid.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
# Function to find the pyramid number that contains the card X
def find_pyramid_number(x, cards_per_pyramid):
    pyramid_number = 1
    while x > cards_per_pyramid[pyramid_number - 1]:
        x -= cards_per_pyramid[pyramid_number - 1]
        pyramid_number += 1
    return pyramid_number if pyramid_number <= len(cards_per_pyramid) else 0

# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete pyramids, unused cards and cards per pyramid
def calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n):
    cards_per_pyramid = []
    total_cards = 0
    pyramid_base = 1
    while total_cards + pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1) // 2 <= n:
        cards_in_current_pyramid = pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1) // 2
        cards_per_pyramid.append(cards_in_current_pyramid)
        total_cards += cards_in_current_pyramid
        pyramid_base += 1
    max_pyramids = pyramid_base - 1
    unused_cards = n - total_cards
    return max_pyramids, unused_cards, cards_per_pyramid

# Function to find the first pyramid with the most white cards
def find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, cards_per_pyramid):
    white_cards_in_pyramids = [0] * len(cards_per_pyramid)
    current_pyramid = 1
    current_card_threshold = cards_per_pyramid[0]
    for card in white_cards:
        while card > current_card_threshold and current_pyramid < len(cards_per_pyramid):
            current_pyramid += 1
            current_card_threshold += cards_per_pyramid[current_pyramid - 1]
        if card <= current_card_threshold:
            white_cards_in_pyramids[current_pyramid - 1] += 1
    max_white_cards = max(white_cards_in_pyramids)
    return white_cards_in_pyramids.index(max_white_cards) + 1 if max_white_cards > 0 else 0

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data
M, C, cards_per_pyramid = calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n)
P = find_pyramid_number(x, cards_per_pyramid)
A = find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, cards_per_pyramid)

# Write output to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This version of the solution accounts for the limits of the lists used, ensuring that we do not attempt to access non-existent indices. Additionally, the `find_pyramid_with_most_white` function checks that the card is within the current pyramid's range before incrementing the white card count for that pyramid. The `cards_per_pyramid` list is used to keep track of the number of cards in each pyramid so that we can determine which pyramid a card belongs to.

It seems there is an issue with the calculation of the pyramid number in which the given card `x` is located. The expected result indicates that card 15 should be in pyramid number 3, but our output is showing pyramid number 4. This bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `find_pyramid_number` function. The thresholds and pyramid numbers are not being calculated correctly.

Similarly, the calculation of the maximum number of complete pyramids (`M`), unused cards (`C`), and the pyramid with the most white cards (`A`) are also incorrect due to issues with the logic used in `calculate_pyramids_and_unused` and `find_pyramid_with_most_white` functions.

Let me correct the implementation and rewrite the entire solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete pyramids, unused cards, and cards per pyramid
def calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n):
    pyramid_base = 1
    total_cards = 0
    cards_per_pyramid = []
    while True:
        cards_in_current_pyramid = pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1) // 2
        if total_cards + cards_in_current_pyramid > n:
            break
        cards_per_pyramid.append(cards_in_current_pyramid)
        total_cards += cards_in_current_pyramid
        pyramid_base += 1
    max_pyramids = len(cards_per_pyramid)
    unused_cards = n - total_cards
    return max_pyramids, unused_cards, cards_per_pyramid

# Function to find the pyramid number that contains the card X
def find_pyramid_number(x, cards_per_pyramid):
    for i, cards in enumerate(cards_per_pyramid):
        x -= cards
        if x <= 0:
            return i + 1
    return 0

# Function to find the first pyramid with the most white cards
def find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, max_pyramids, cards_per_pyramid):
    white_cards_in_pyramids = [0] * max_pyramids
    current_pyramid = 1
    cards_count = 0
    for card in white_cards:
        while card > cards_count + cards_per_pyramid[current_pyramid - 1]:
            cards_count += cards_per_pyramid[current_pyramid - 1]
            current_pyramid += 1
        if current_pyramid <= max_pyramids:
            white_cards_in_pyramids[current_pyramid - 1] += 1
    max_white_cards = max(white_cards_in_pyramids)
    if max_white_cards == 0:
        return 0
    return white_cards_in_pyramids.index(max_white_cards) + 1

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Process the data
M, C, cards_per_pyramid = calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n)
P = find_pyramid_number(x, cards_per_pyramid)
A = find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, M, cards_per_pyramid)

# Write output to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

I have corrected the logic to properly calculate the pyramid number for a card `x`, the maximum number of pyramids that can be built, the number of unused cards, and the pyramid with the most white cards. This should now match the expected output.

The `IndexError` suggests that we are trying to access an element in `cards_per_pyramid` with an index that is out of range. This likely happens when the `current_pyramid` index exceeds the length of the `cards_per_pyramid` list. We need to add a boundary check to ensure `current_pyramid` does not go beyond the number of pyramids that can be built with the given number of cards (`n`).

Here is the revised solution:

```python
# Function to calculate the number of cards needed to build pyramids
def calculate_cards_per_pyramid(max_pyramid_base):
    cards_per_pyramid = [0] * (max_pyramid_base + 1)
    for base in range(1, max_pyramid_base + 1):
        cards_per_pyramid[base] = cards_per_pyramid[base - 1] + (base * (base + 1)) // 2
    return cards_per_pyramid

def find_pyramid_number(x, cards_per_pyramid):
    for pyramid_base in range(1, len(cards_per_pyramid)):

    for card in white_cards:
        pyramid_base = find_pyramid_number(card, cards_per_pyramid)
        if pyramid_base > 0:
            white_cards_in_pyramids[pyramid_base] += 1
    most_white_cards = max(white_cards_in_pyramids)
    if most_white_cards == 0:
        return 0
    return white_cards_in_pyramids.index(most_white_cards)


# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate the maximum pyramid base that can be built with n cards
max_pyramid_base = 1
while (max_pyramid_base * (max_pyramid_base + 1) * (max_pyramid_base + 2)) // 6 <= n:
    max_pyramid_base += 1
max_pyramid_base -= 1

# Calculate cards per pyramid
cards_per_pyramid = calculate_cards_per_pyramid(max_pyramid_base)

# Process the data
P = find_pyramid_number(x, cards_per_pyramid)
M = max_pyramid_base
C = n - cards_per_pyramid[-1]
A = find_pyramid_with_most_white(white_cards, cards_per_pyramid, M)

# Write output to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:

```

This solution should now correctly identify the pyramid in which card `x` is located, the maximum number of pyramids that can be built, the number of unused cards, and the pyramid with the most white cards without running into an index out of range error.

The output differs from the expected result due to incorrect logic in the calculation of the pyramid number containing the card `x`, as well as the total number of complete pyramids that can be constructed from `n` cards, the number of unused cards, and the pyramid with the most white cards.

The calculation error seems to come from the way we are determining the pyramid number for a given card `x`. The pyramid number should be calculated based on the total number of cards used so far and the number of cards in each level of the pyramid. Similarly, the maximum number of complete pyramids (M) should be calculated based on a summation that allows for the building of complete pyramids only.

Let's correct the logic and rewrite the solution:

```python
# Function to find the pyramid number that contains the card X
def find_pyramid_number(x):
    total_cards = 0
    pyramid_base = 1
    while True:
        cards_in_pyramid = (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2
        if total_cards + cards_in_pyramid >= x:
            return pyramid_base
        total_cards += cards_in_pyramid
        pyramid_base += 1
    return 0

# Function to calculate the maximum number of complete pyramids and unused cards
def calculate_pyramids_and_unused(n):

This solution should now provide the correct output. It carefully calculates the pyramid number containing card X, the total number of complete pyramids that can be built with N cards, the number of unused cards, and the pyramid containing the most white cards. We count the white cards in each pyramid while iterating through the cards and keep track of the maximum.

The output still does not match the expected results. The logic for determining the pyramid number containing card `X` is incorrect. The same logic applies to calculating the maximum number of complete pyramids and the pyramid with the most white cards.

Let's analyze the issue:
1. For card `X`, we need to calculate which pyramid it belongs to by incrementally adding the count of cards in each pyramid until we reach or surpass `X`.
2. To calculate the maximum number of complete pyramids `M`, we need to continue adding cards to pyramids until we do not have enough cards to complete the next pyramid.
3. To find the pyramid with the most white cards `A`, we need to tally white cards in each pyramid during the process of adding cards to pyramids.

Given the constraints and aiming for optimal memory usage, let's rewrite the entire solution:

```python
# Function to calculate information about pyramids
def calculate_pyramids_info(n, white_cards):
    total_cards = 0
    pyramid_base = 1
    pyramid_card_start = 1
    P = M = C = A = 0
    max_white_count = 0
    current_white_count = 0

    # Create a set for O(1) lookups
    white_cards_set = set(white_cards)

    while total_cards + (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2 <= n:
        # Calculate the number of cards used by the current pyramid
        cards_in_pyramid = (pyramid_base * (pyramid_base + 1)) // 2
        M += 1  # We can build another pyramid
        total_cards += cards_in_pyramid
        pyramid_card_end = pyramid_card_start + cards_in_pyramid - 1

        # If we're looking for the pyramid containing card X
        if P == 0 and pyramid_card_start <= x <= pyramid_card_end:
            P = M  # Card X is in the current pyramid

        # Count white cards in the current pyramid
        current_white_count = sum(1 for card in range(pyramid_card_start, pyramid_card_end + 1) if card in white_cards_set)
        if current_white_count > max_white_count:
            max_white_count = current_white_count
            A = M  # The current pyramid has the highest count of white cards so far

        # Prepare for the next pyramid
        pyramid_base += 1
        pyramid_card_start = pyramid_card_end + 1

    C = n - total_cards  # Cards remaining after building the last complete pyramid
    return P, M, C, A

# Read data from file
with open('piramide.in', 'r') as file:
    n, x, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
    white_cards = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))

# Calculate information about pyramids
P, M, C, A = calculate_pyramids_info(n, white_cards)

# Write output to file
with open('piramide.out', 'w') as file:
    file.write(f"{P}\n{M}\n{C}\n{A}\n")
```

This solution defines a single function that calculates all the required information in one pass, which is more efficient. We keep track of which cards belong to which pyramid by using the `pyramid_card_start` and `pyramid_card_end` variables. We also use a set to store the white cards for O(1) lookups, which helps when counting the white cards within each pyramid. This should provide the correct output according to the problem's requirements.
