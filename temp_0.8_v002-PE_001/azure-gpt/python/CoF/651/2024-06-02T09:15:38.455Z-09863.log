        if task == 2:
            exclusions = [0]
        else:
            exclusions = [0, 1]

        min_gcd = None
        for i in exclusions:
            gcd_value = compute_gcd(np.delete(numbers, i))
            if min_gcd is None or gcd_value < min_gcd:
                min_gcd = gcd_value
        result = min_gcd

    with open('cmmdc.out', 'w') as file:
        file.write(str(result))

if __name__ == "__main__":

```
```

Please note:
- The provided code should be stored in a Python (.py) file.
- The code assumes `cmmdc.in` file is present in the current directory.
- The code writes the result to `cmmdc.out` in the current directory.
- `gcd` function from `math` is used instead of writing one from scratch as it is already optimized.
- The `reduce` function from `functools` is used to apply the `gcd` function across a list of numbers efficiently.
- Memory usage is minimized by using numpy arrays with dtype set to `np.int64`, ensuring it aligns with long long integer size in C/C++ (64-bit).
- Instead of finding the gcd of the entire array and then adjusting for tasks 2 and 3, the code computes the gcd of the necessary subset directly, which is more efficient.
- The code should handle the constraints of the problem well, though it has not been tested for all edge cases or large inputs.

            subset = np.delete(numbers, [i, j])
            subset_gcd = find_gcd(subset)
            all_gcds.append(subset_gcd)
    return max(all_gcds)

# Main function to read input, process and write output
def main():
    # Read input from file
    with open('cmmdc.in', 'r') as f:
        task = int(f.readline().strip())
        n = int(f.readline().strip())
        numbers = np.array([int(f.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)], dtype=np.int64)

    # Process based on the task
    if task == 1:
        result = find_gcd(numbers)
    elif task == 2:
        result = gcd_excluding_one(numbers)

```

This updated solution carefully adheres to the requirement of reading from `cmmdc.in` and writing to `cmmdc.out`. It does not use `input()` or `print()` for I/O operations. It implements an efficient way to compute the gcd for tasks 2 and 3 by considering all possible combinations but only for the necessary cases (excluding one or two elements). It also uses numpy to handle the large numbers and optimize memory usage.

The error indicates that the `numpy` module is not available. Given that the program must be memory efficient and that importing `numpy` could be a problem, we should refactor the code to avoid using `numpy`. We can do this using standard Python lists and the built-in `math.gcd` function.

Let's rewrite the solution without using `numpy`:

```python
from math import gcd
from itertools import combinations

# Efficient function to find the gcd of more than two numbers using functools.reduce
def find_gcd(numbers):
    return gcd(numbers[0], numbers[1]) if len(numbers) == 2 else gcd(numbers[0], find_gcd(numbers[1:]))

# Function to solve task 2: find gcd excluding one element
def gcd_excluding_one(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    max_gcd = 0
    for i in range(n):
        subset = numbers[:i] + numbers[i+1:]
        subset_gcd = find_gcd(subset)
        max_gcd = max(max_gcd, subset_gcd)
    return max_gcd

# Function to solve task 3: find gcd excluding two elements
def gcd_excluding_two(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    max_gcd = 0
    for combo in combinations(numbers, n - 2):
        subset_gcd = find_gcd(list(combo))
        max_gcd = max(max_gcd, subset_gcd)
    return max_gcd

# Main function to read input, process and write output
def main():
    # Read input from file
    with open('cmmdc.in', 'r') as f:
        task = int(f.readline().strip())
        n = int(f.readline().strip())
        numbers = [int(f.readline().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

    # Process based on the task
    if task == 1:
        result = find_gcd(numbers)
    elif task == 2:
        result = gcd_excluding_one(numbers)
    elif task == 3:
        result = gcd_excluding_two(numbers)

    # Write output to file
    with open('cmmdc.out', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(result))

# Call the main function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The above code removes all dependencies on `numpy` and uses only built-in Python modules and functions. It also uses a recursive call for the `find_gcd` function to calculate the GCD of more than two numbers. For tasks 2 and 3, I've used Python's `itertools.combinations` method to generate combinations for the subsets we need to consider when finding the GCD, thereby ensuring that memory usage remains within acceptable limits.
