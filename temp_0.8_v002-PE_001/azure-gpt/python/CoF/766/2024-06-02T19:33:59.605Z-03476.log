Campania electorală s-a terminat de mult, dar zidul din parcul central al orașului în care au fost puse afișele este încă într-o formă dezolantă. Ploile și vântul au acționat și au urâțit și mai mult această zonă pe care altă dată erau afișe frumos colorate. Primăria a decis să se ocupe de această problemă. A format o comisie și a decis realizarea unor panouri reclamă care să ascundă porțiunile deteriorate.

Deoarece fondurile sunt mici s-a decis să fie alocate doar un anumit număr de panouri publicitare care trebuie să ocupe o suprafață cât mai mică posibil. Comisia a primit datele din teren sub forma: lungime zid, câte unități sunt ocupate cu afișe ce trebuie acoperite și care este numărul de panouri pe care le poate folosi. De asemenea se primesc ca date și care sunt unitățile de zid ocupate cu afișe deja deteriorate.

# Cerință

Fiind date lungimea zidului, câte unități sunt deteriorate, care este numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite și care sunt unitățile de zid deteriorate, se cere să se determine lungimea minimă totală a panourilor care sunt folosite pentru a acoperi zona și câte panouri se folosesc. Lungimea minimă o definim ca numărul total de unități de zid acoperite astfel încât să fie mascate zonele problemă. Pentru acoperirea unităților de zid deteriorate, nu este neapărat necesar să se folosească toate panourile. Numărul de panouri folosite fiind limitat există posibilitatea să fie acoperite și zone din zid care sunt curate.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `afise.in` conține pe prima linie $3$ valori separate prin câte un spațiu $L \ n \ k$, cu semnificația: $L$ lungimea totală a zidului, $n$ numărul de unități ce urmează a fi acoperite și $k$ numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite. Pe a doua linie separate prin câte un spațiu sunt $n$ valori $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, unde xi reprezintă unitatea din zid care este acoperită de un afiș vechi. Valorile $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, apar într-o ordine aleatoare.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `afise.out` conține o singură linie cu două valoari ce reprezintă lungimea minimă totală folosită și numărul de panouri folosite astfel încât toate zonele deteriorate să fie acoperite.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < L \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 < n \leq L$;
* $0 < k \leq L / 2$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:Here's a Python solution for the given problem, which optimizes both time and memory usage. We read the input from `afise.in` and output the result to `afise.out`.

```python
import numpy as np

with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = np.array(list(map(int, fin.readline().split())), dtype=np.int32)

# Sort the array of damaged units to be able to cluster them
damaged_units.sort()

# Initialize the total covered length and number of panels used
total_covered_length = 0
panels_used = 0

# Use greedy approach to cover as many adjacent damaged units with one panel
i = 0
while i < n and panels_used < k:
    # Start by covering the current damaged unit
    start = damaged_units[i]
    end = start
    i += 1

    # Extend the panel to cover adjacent damaged units if possible within the same panel
    while i < n and damaged_units[i] <= end + 1 and panels_used < k:
        end = damaged_units[i]
        i += 1

    # Update the total covered length and increment the number of panels used
    total_covered_length += (end - start + 1)
    panels_used += 1

# Write the output to afise.out
with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{total_covered_length} {panels_used}\n")
```

This solution first reads the input and sorts the list of damaged units. After sorting, it uses a greedy approach to cover as many adjacent damaged units with one panel as possible, while keeping track of the number of panels used and the total covered length. Finally, it writes the result to `afise.out`. The memory usage is minimized by using `numpy` arrays and the algorithm itself is designed to be both time and memory efficient.

It appears that the `numpy` library is not available in the environment where the code is running, as indicated by the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Since we have a strict memory limit and cannot use large libraries like `numpy`, we need to write the code using only the built-in modules available in Python.

Here's the revised solution without using `numpy`:

```python
# Read input from afise.in
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Sort the array of damaged units to be able to cluster them
damaged_units.sort()

# Initialize the total covered length and number of panels used
total_covered_length = 0
panels_used = 0

# Use greedy approach to cover as many adjacent damaged units with one panel
i = 0
while i < n and panels_used < k:
    # Start by covering the current damaged unit
    start = damaged_units[i]
    end = start
    i += 1

    # Extend the panel to cover adjacent damaged units if possible within the same panel
    while i < n and damaged_units[i] <= end + 1:
        end = damaged_units[i]
        i += 1

    # Update the total covered length and increment the number of panels used
    total_covered_length += (end - start + 1)
    panels_used += 1

# Write the output to afise.out
with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{total_covered_length} {panels_used}\n")
```

This code does the same as the previous version but does not rely on any third-party modules. It uses built-in Python functions and methods to read from and write to files, and to sort and iterate through lists. This code should meet both the time and memory efficiency requirements for the given problem.

After evaluating the differences between the expected and found results, it's clear that the current approach is not correctly computing the minimum total length of the panels. The issue lies in how we are extending the panel to cover adjacent damaged units. The current code is only considering directly adjacent units (i.e., consecutive numbers), but there could be gaps between the damaged units that a single panel can still cover efficiently.

We need to modify the code to allow for covering gaps between damaged units up to the maximum number of panels (`k`). We need to consider that we might need to cover some undamaged units to minimize the total length of the panels used. We can achieve this by calculating the gaps between the damaged units and then deciding the best way to place the panels to cover the maximum range with the minimum number of panels.

Let's rewrite the solution with the necessary fix:

```python
# Read input from afise.in
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Sort the array of damaged units to be able to cluster them
damaged_units.sort()

# Calculate gaps between damaged units
gaps = [damaged_units[i+1] - damaged_units[i] - 1 for i in range(n-1)]

# Sort gaps in descending order, we want to place the panels on the smallest gaps first
gaps.sort(reverse=True)

# Initialize the total covered length as the number of damaged units
total_covered_length = n

# We can use at most k panels, so remove k-1 largest gaps from the total length
# These are the gaps we will NOT cover with panels
for i in range(min(k-1, len(gaps))):
    total_covered_length += gaps[i]

# Number of panels used is the minimum of k or the number of actual gaps
panels_used = min(k, n)

# Write the output to afise.out
with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{total_covered_length} {panels_used}\n")
```

With this corrected algorithm, the program should now output the correct result, which is the minimum total length of panels used and the actual number of panels used to cover the damaged units, including the strategy to span over gaps effectively.

The solution above still doesn't produce the expected output because it does not account for the fact that we are trying to cover the damaged units with the minimum total length of panels. The gaps are taken into account incorrectly; the algorithm should instead look for the best way to place the panels to cover the damaged units.

Here's the bug-fixed algorithm:

1. Sort the damaged units.
2. Calculate the ranges of consecutive damaged units.
3. Sort these ranges by their lengths.
4. Start covering the largest ranges using the available panels.
5. If panels remain, use them to cover individual units or extend existing panels, whichever minimizes the length.

Let's rewrite the solution with this algorithm:

```python
# Read input from afise.in
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Sort the array of damaged units
damaged_units.sort()

# Initialize the total covered length and number of panels used
total_covered_length = 0
panels_used = 0

# Find ranges of consecutive damaged units
ranges = []
start = damaged_units[0]
for i in range(1, n):
    if damaged_units[i] != damaged_units[i-1] + 1:
        ranges.append((start, damaged_units[i-1]))
        start = damaged_units[i]
# Add the last range
ranges.append((start, damaged_units[-1]))

# Sort ranges by their lengths (longest first)
ranges.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)

# Cover the ranges using the available panels
for r in ranges:
    if panels_used < k:
        range_length = r[1] - r[0] + 1
        total_covered_length += range_length
        panels_used += 1
    else:
        break

# Calculate the uncovered units
uncovered_units = n - total_covered_length

# If we still have panels left, use them to cover the uncovered units
while panels_used < k and uncovered_units > 0:
    panels_used += 1
    # Each panel can cover at least one unit
    total_covered_length += 1
    uncovered_units -= 1

# Write the output to afise.out
with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{total_covered_length} {panels_used}\n")
```

With this logic, the code should now correctly compute the minimum total length of the panels used and the actual number of panels used to cover the damaged units, considering the best way to span over both consecutive and non-consecutive damaged units.

The previous solution still fails to provide the expected output because it only considers covering ranges of consecutive damaged units without properly accounting for the possibility of spanning gaps with the panels to minimize the total length of panels used.

The correct algorithm should consider the optimal placement of the panels to cover all damaged units with the minimum total length. This can be achieved by checking the distances between each pair of damaged units and deciding which gaps to cover based on the number of available panels.

Let's implement a solution that considers the optimal placement of panels:

```python
# Read input from afise.in
with open('afise.in', 'r') as fin:
    L, n, k = map(int, fin.readline().split())
    damaged_units = list(map(int, fin.readline().split()))

# Sort the array of damaged units
damaged_units.sort()

# Calculate gaps between consecutive damaged units
gaps = [damaged_units[i] - damaged_units[i - 1] - 1 for i in range(1, n)]
# Sort gaps to find the smallest ones
gaps.sort()

# The total number of panels we can use is k, so we can leave at most k - 1 gaps uncovered
# Initially, the total covered length is the number of damaged units
# Then, we add the smallest gaps until we have used all our panels
total_covered_length = n
for i in range(n - k):
    if i < len(gaps):
        total_covered_length += gaps[i]

# The number of panels used is the minimum of k and the number of clusters of damaged units
# A cluster is defined as a group of damaged units separated by a gap of one or more undamaged units
clusters = 1
for gap in gaps:
    if gap > 0:
        clusters += 1
panels_used = min(clusters, k)

# Write the output to afise.out
with open('afise.out', 'w') as fout:
    fout.write(f"{total_covered_length} {panels_used}\n")
```

This solution first calculates the gaps between the consecutive damaged units and sorts them. Then it adds the lengths of the smallest gaps to the total covered length until all panels are used. The number of panels used is the minimum of the total available panels and the number of clusters of damaged units. This will ensure that we span over gaps optimally to minimize the total length of panels used.
