Campania electorală s-a terminat de mult, dar zidul din parcul central al orașului în care au fost puse afișele este încă într-o formă dezolantă. Ploile și vântul au acționat și au urâțit și mai mult această zonă pe care altă dată erau afișe frumos colorate. Primăria a decis să se ocupe de această problemă. A format o comisie și a decis realizarea unor panouri reclamă care să ascundă porțiunile deteriorate.

Deoarece fondurile sunt mici s-a decis să fie alocate doar un anumit număr de panouri publicitare care trebuie să ocupe o suprafață cât mai mică posibil. Comisia a primit datele din teren sub forma: lungime zid, câte unități sunt ocupate cu afișe ce trebuie acoperite și care este numărul de panouri pe care le poate folosi. De asemenea se primesc ca date și care sunt unitățile de zid ocupate cu afișe deja deteriorate.

# Cerință

Fiind date lungimea zidului, câte unități sunt deteriorate, care este numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite și care sunt unitățile de zid deteriorate, se cere să se determine lungimea minimă totală a panourilor care sunt folosite pentru a acoperi zona și câte panouri se folosesc. Lungimea minimă o definim ca numărul total de unități de zid acoperite astfel încât să fie mascate zonele problemă. Pentru acoperirea unităților de zid deteriorate, nu este neapărat necesar să se folosească toate panourile. Numărul de panouri folosite fiind limitat există posibilitatea să fie acoperite și zone din zid care sunt curate.

# Date de intrare

Fișierul de intrare `afise.in` conține pe prima linie $3$ valori separate prin câte un spațiu $L \ n \ k$, cu semnificația: $L$ lungimea totală a zidului, $n$ numărul de unități ce urmează a fi acoperite și $k$ numărul maxim de panouri ce pot fi folosite. Pe a doua linie separate prin câte un spațiu sunt $n$ valori $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, unde xi reprezintă unitatea din zid care este acoperită de un afiș vechi. Valorile $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, apar într-o ordine aleatoare.

# Date de ieșire

Fișierul de ieșire `afise.out` conține o singură linie cu două valoari ce reprezintă lungimea minimă totală folosită și numărul de panouri folosite astfel încât toate zonele deteriorate să fie acoperite.

# Restricții și precizări

* $0 < L \leq 1 \ 000$;
* $0 < n \leq L$;
* $0 < k \leq L / 2$;

Before writing my solution in python, I will think about the challenge step by step, come up with the most optimal solution, then I will verify the logic against the example.
Here are all the necessary steps to solve the challenge:```python
import numpy as np

def read_input(filename='afise.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        damaged = np.array(file.readline().split(), dtype=int)
    return L, n, k, damaged

def write_output(min_length, used_panels, filename='afise.out'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")

def solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged):
    # Sort the damaged units for calculating consecutive unit gaps
    damaged.sort()
    
    # Calculate gaps
    # np.diff gives the difference between consecutive elements,
    # subtracting 1 because we're interested in the space between posters,
    # not the difference of their positions.
    gaps = np.diff(damaged) - 1
    
    # We'll cover the largest gaps with the panels, so we sort them decreasingly
    gaps.sort()
    
    # Since we need to cover n damaged units, we start with that as minimum length.
    min_length = n
    
    # If we have more than 1 panel, we can consider placing them strategically.
    # Largest gaps are at the end of the sorted gaps, we skip as many as we have panels minus 1.
    # Each panel can cover a gap completely, so we don't need to add the gap lengths to min_length.
    min_length += np.sum(gaps[:-(k-1)]) if k > 1 else np.sum(gaps)
    
    # The number of used panels is the minimum between the number of gaps and k
    used_panels = min(len(gaps) + 1, k)
    
    return min_length, used_panels

# Read input, solve the problem, write output
L, n, k, damaged = read_input()
min_length, used_panels = solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged)
write_output(min_length, used_panels)
```

This solution reads the input data from `afise.in`, processes it to find the minimum total length of the panels and the number of panels used, and writes the output to `afise.out`. It takes care of optimizing both time and memory usage by utilizing numpy for efficient array manipulations and sorting. The memory requirement is also respected by not using any extra data structures that could cause memory overflow.

The program exited with code 1 due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the `numpy` module is not available in the environment where the code is being run. Since we have a memory limit and must optimize the usage, we can avoid using `numpy` and instead use built-in Python functionalities.

I will now rewrite the solution using standard Python libraries:

```python
def read_input(filename='afise.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        damaged = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return L, n, k, damaged

def write_output(min_length, used_panels, filename='afise.out'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")

def solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged):
    # Sort the damaged units
    damaged.sort()
    
    # Calculate the gaps between damaged units
    gaps = [damaged[i] - damaged[i - 1] - 1 for i in range(1, len(damaged))]
    
    # Sort the gaps in ascending order, we will try to cover the smallest gaps
    gaps.sort()
    
    # Start with minimum length equal to the number of damaged units
    min_length = n
    
    # If we have more than one panel, we can cover the smallest gaps first
    min_length += sum(gaps[:max(0, len(gaps) - (k - 1))])
    
    # The number of used panels is either k or the number of gaps plus one
    used_panels = min(len(gaps) + 1, k)
    
    return min_length, used_panels

# Read input, solve the problem, write output
L, n, k, damaged = read_input()
min_length, used_panels = solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged)
write_output(min_length, used_panels)
```

This solution should now work without requiring `numpy` or any other external libraries. It uses built-in Python functions and data structures to accomplish the same task, thus avoiding the `ModuleNotFoundError` and adhering to the memory constraints.

The discrepancy between the expected and found output arises from a mistake in the logic used to determine the number of used panels. The current implementation assumes that we would always use either the number of gaps plus one or `k` panels, whichever is smaller. However, we should only use as many panels as needed to cover the gaps, and the number of gaps might be less than `k`. If there are more panels than gaps, not all panels will be used.

Additionally, the way we add gaps to the minimum length is incorrect. We need to cover the smallest gaps with panels if we can. We should ideally skip the largest gaps first, as we have a limited number of panels and want to minimize the total length used.

Let's fix the solution:

```python
def read_input(filename='afise.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        damaged = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return L, n, k, damaged

def write_output(min_length, used_panels, filename='afise.out'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")

def solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged):
    # Sort the damaged units
    damaged.sort()
    
    # Calculate the gaps between damaged units
    gaps = [damaged[i] - damaged[i - 1] - 1 for i in range(1, len(damaged))]
    
    # Sort the gaps in descending order, so we can cover the largest gaps first
    gaps.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Start with minimum length equal to the number of damaged units
    min_length = n
    
    # We can use at most k - 1 gaps to place our k panels, covering the largest gaps first
    # We only add to the minimum length if we run out of panels to cover the gaps
    min_length += sum(gaps[k - 1:]) if k < len(gaps) + 1 else 0
    
    # The number of used panels is k unless the number of gaps is less than k - 1
    used_panels = min(len(gaps) + 1, k)
    
    return min_length, used_panels

# Read input, solve the problem, write output
L, n, k, damaged = read_input()
min_length, used_panels = solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged)
write_output(min_length, used_panels)
```

This corrected version of the solution should now provide the expected output. The error was in the mistake of counting the number of used panels and the logic of adding gaps to the minimum length. We now sort the gaps in descending order to use the panels to cover the largest gaps first, and the number of used panels is correctly determined based on the number of gaps and available panels.

The difference between the expected and found result is due to incorrect logic in calculating the number of panels used. The expected result indicates that we should use only 3 panels to cover the 4 damaged units, but the current implementation results in 4 panels being used.

The logic flaw lies in the way we determine the number of used panels: we need to consider that if we have more panels available than the number of contiguous damaged sections, we won't be using all available panels. Additionally, we should be considering the continuous sections of the wall that need to be covered, rather than just the gaps between damaged units.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def read_input(filename='afise.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        damaged = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return L, n, k, damaged

def write_output(min_length, used_panels, filename='afise.out'):

        file.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")

def solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged):
    # Sort the damaged units
    damaged.sort()
    
    # Initialize the total length covered by the panels
    min_length = n
    
    # Calculate the gaps between damaged units
    gaps = [damaged[i] - damaged[i - 1] - 1 for i in range(1, len(damaged))]
    
    # If we have only one panel, we need to cover all the gaps
    if k == 1:
        return min_length + sum(gaps), 1
    
    # Sort gaps in ascending order to consider covering smaller gaps first
    gaps.sort()

    # Determine the number of damaged sections that we need to cover
    # It's the number of damaged units plus the gaps between them
    damaged_sections = len(gaps) + 1

    # If we have enough panels to cover each damaged section separately,
    # then we don't need to cover any gaps, and we use as many panels as there are damaged sections
    if k >= damaged_sections:
        return min_length, damaged_sections

    # Otherwise, we have to use panels to cover some gaps; 
    # we will use one less than the number of available panels to cover the smallest gaps
    min_length += sum(gaps[:damaged_sections - k])

    # The number of panels used is the total number we have available
    used_panels = k

    return min_length, used_panels

# Read input, solve the problem, write output
L, n, k, damaged = read_input()
min_length, used_panels = solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged)
write_output(min_length, used_panels)
```

This revised solution takes into account the number of damaged sections and the number of available panels to determine the minimum length of the panels used and the actual number of panels used. It covers the smallest gaps with panels if we have fewer panels than damaged sections, which minimizes the total length used.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output lies in the logic for determining the number of panels used and the total length of panels required to cover the damaged units. The solution is incorrectly calculating the panels necessary when there are more panels available than required to cover the gaps between damaged units.

The logic to determine the number of used panels should consider that some panels can cover multiple damaged units if they are contiguous or have small gaps that can be covered without exceeding the available panels. The previous solutions did not account for this possibility.

To resolve this issue, we can approach the problem in the following steps:
1. Sort the damaged unit positions.
2. Calculate the contiguous ranges of damaged units and the number of panels needed to cover them.
3. Use the smallest number of panels possible to cover these ranges.

Here's the revised and fixed solution:

```python
def read_input(filename='afise.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        damaged = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return L, n, k, damaged

def write_output(min_length, used_panels, filename='afise.out'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")

def solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged):
    # Sort the damaged units
    damaged.sort()

    # Initialize variables
    used_panels = 0
    min_length = 0
    start = damaged[0]

    # Iterate through the sorted damaged units
    for i in range(1, len(damaged)):
        # If current unit is not adjacent to the previous, or we have used up available panels
        if damaged[i] != damaged[i-1] + 1 or used_panels == k:
            # Add the length of the current panel and increment used panels
            min_length += (damaged[i-1] - start + 1)
            used_panels += 1
            start = damaged[i]  # Start a new panel

        # If we've reached the last damaged unit, close the last panel
        if i == len(damaged) - 1:
            min_length += (damaged[i] - start + 1)
            used_panels += 1
            
    return min_length, used_panels

# Read input, solve the problem, write output
L, n, k, damaged = read_input()
min_length, used_panels = solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged)
write_output(min_length, used_panels)
```

This solution should correctly determine that 3 panels are needed to cover the 4 damaged units and that the total length of these panels is 4. It does so by iterating through sorted damaged units and counting contiguous units as a single panel up to the available number of panels.

The discrepancy between the expected and found result indicates that the current logic does not effectively utilize the limited number of panels to cover the maximum number of damaged units while also minimizing the total length of the panels used.

The expected output suggests that with 3 panels, the minimum total length used should be 11, which means the panels must be placed to cover the largest possible gaps between the damaged units, thus minimizing the total number of units covered. The previously implemented logic does not achieve this because it does not account for the strategic placement of panels to cover the largest gaps.

To address this issue, we need to:
1. Sort the damaged unit positions.
2. Calculate the gaps between the damaged units.
3. Identify the largest gaps that we can leave uncovered while using the remaining panels to cover the smaller gaps and all damaged units.
4. Sum the lengths of the panels used to cover the damaged units and the smaller gaps.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
def read_input(filename='afise.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        damaged = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return L, n, k, damaged

def write_output(min_length, used_panels, filename='afise.out'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")

def solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged):
    # Sort the damaged units
    damaged.sort()
    
    # Calculate the gaps between consecutive damaged units
    gaps = [damaged[i] - damaged[i-1] - 1 for i in range(1, n)]
    gaps.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort the gaps in descending order
    
    # The total length starts as the number of damaged units
    min_length = n
    
    # We can leave the largest k-1 gaps uncovered, so we do not add their lengths
    for gap in gaps[k-1:]:
        min_length += gap

    # The number of panels used is k unless we do not have enough damaged units to use all panels
    num_panels = min(k, n)
    
    return min_length, num_panels

# Read input, solve the problem, write output
L, n, k, damaged = read_input()
min_length, used_panels = solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged)
write_output(min_length, used_panels)
```

This solution takes into account the limited number of panels and strategically places them to cover the smallest gaps, leaving the largest gaps (up to k-1 of them) uncovered. It calculates the minimum total length of the panels used while ensuring that all damaged units are covered.

The root of the discrepancy is that the current logic incorrectly calculates the number of panels used. When there are more available panels than needed to cover the gaps between the damaged units, we should not use all of them. The expected output indicates that three panels should suffice to cover the damaged units with a total length of four.

A correct approach should strategically place panels to cover the damaged areas with the smallest total length and also use the fewest possible number of panels up to the limit of `k`. This means we need to identify the gaps between the damaged units and decide which gaps can be left uncovered based on the number of available panels. Since we are allowed to use fewer panels than `k`, we must consider this in our calculation.

Let's correct the logic in our implementation:

```python
def read_input(filename='afise.in'):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        L, n, k = map(int, file.readline().split())
        damaged = list(map(int, file.readline().split()))
    return L, n, k, damaged

def write_output(min_length, used_panels, filename='afise.out'):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{min_length} {used_panels}\n")

def solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged):
    # Sort the damaged units
    damaged.sort()
    
    # Identify the gaps between damaged units
    gaps = [damaged[i] - damaged[i-1] - 1 for i in range(1, len(damaged))]
    
    # Sort the gaps in ascending order, because we will try to cover the smallest gaps with panels
    gaps.sort()
    
    # Start with the number of damaged units covered
    min_length = n
    
    # Initialize the number of panels used
    used_panels = 0
    
    # The number of gaps we can leave uncovered is the number of panels minus one
    uncovered_gaps = k - 1
    
    # Cover the gaps with the panels, starting from the smallest gaps
    for gap in gaps:
        if uncovered_gaps > 0:
            # We leave this gap uncovered and decrease the count of uncovered gaps
            uncovered_gaps -= 1
        else:
            # We need to cover this gap with a panel, so we add its length to the total length
            min_length += gap
            used_panels += 1
    
    # If we haven't used all the panels after covering the gaps, we use one more to cover the rightmost damaged unit
    if used_panels < k:
        used_panels += 1
    
    return min_length, used_panels

# Read input, solve the problem, write output
L, n, k, damaged = read_input()
min_length, used_panels = solve_campaign_posters(L, n, k, damaged)
write_output(min_length, used_panels)
```

This solution should correctly calculate the number of used panels and the minimum total length of the panels. It covers the smallest gaps first, leaving up to `k - 1` largest gaps uncovered, and only uses as many panels as necessary to cover all damaged units.
